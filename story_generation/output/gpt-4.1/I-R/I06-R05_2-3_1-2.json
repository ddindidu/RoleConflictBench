The assignment was clear: finish the code before our next meeting in three days. I knew how much my mentor valued diligence and follow-through, and I wanted to prove myself worthy of their investment. But as I stared at the lines of code, my mind kept drifting to the High Holiday sermon I was expected to deliver. The congregation would be gathering in just two days, and the weight of their expectations pressed on me. As rabbi, I was supposed to offer wisdom, inspiration, and comfort\u2014especially now, when so many were seeking guidance. My notes for the sermon were scattered and incomplete, and I felt the pressure mounting from both sides. I wanted to honor my mentor\u2019s trust, but I also couldn\u2019t let my community down. The demands pulled at me, each urgent in its own way, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure how to give my best to either role."}
