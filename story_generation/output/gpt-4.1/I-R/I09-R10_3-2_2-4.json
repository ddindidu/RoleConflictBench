Our floor\u2019s noise complaint had finally brought us all together, and I could see Mrs. Sharma, my friend and fellow Hindu, standing quietly in the corner. As a neighbor, I knew I was expected to be friendly, polite, and keep the peace, especially in tense moments like this. But as the meeting began, I noticed the conversation turning unfairly against Mrs. Sharma. Some neighbors accused her of being the source of the noise, their words sharp and dismissive. My heart pounded. My Hindu values urged me to stand up for what was right, to defend her against this injustice. Yet, I also felt the weight of my role as a neighbor, the unspoken rule to avoid confrontation and maintain harmony. I could feel the conflict tightening in my chest\u2014should I speak up and risk upsetting the delicate balance, or stay silent and betray my own principles?"}
