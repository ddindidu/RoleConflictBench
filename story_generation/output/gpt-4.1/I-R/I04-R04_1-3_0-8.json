I just need to vent.\u201d I knew he\u2019d want me to listen, maybe crack a joke, remind him he\u2019s not alone. I started typing a reply, but before I could finish, the mosque door creaked open. A woman entered, her face streaked with tears, clutching a crumpled tissue. \u201cImam, please, I need to talk. I just lost my father.\u201d Her voice trembled, and I could feel the weight of her grief. As an imam, I\u2019m expected to be present, to offer comfort and spiritual guidance in moments like this. But Amir\u2019s message blinked on my screen, a reminder of my promise to be there for my friends, too. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014one toward the friend who needed my ear, the other toward the community member who needed my counsel. I stood there, phone in hand, torn between the roles I cherished, feeling the pressure of expectations I wasn\u2019t sure I could meet at the same time."}
