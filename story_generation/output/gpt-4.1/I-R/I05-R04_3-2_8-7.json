As a mentor, I knew how much this project meant to Aisha\u2014her entire future seemed to hinge on its success. She had asked for my feedback before her final presentation, and I promised to review her work tonight. She was counting on me to help her grow, to push her beyond her comfort zone, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from Brother Kareem, a pillar of our mosque. His words were heavy: \u201cImam, I need to talk. My family is falling apart. Can you meet tonight?\u201d As an imam, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and guidance when my community needed me most. Kareem rarely reached out, and I sensed his desperation.\n\nI stared at my calendar, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My mentee\u2019s future, my congregant\u2019s crisis\u2014both urgent, both deserving. My heart pounded as I tried to reconcile the impossible demands, torn between nurturing growth and offering solace, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
