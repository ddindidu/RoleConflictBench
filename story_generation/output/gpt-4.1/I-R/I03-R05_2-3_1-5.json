The words must sting\u2014he\u2019s been working so hard, and now this setback. He needs me, I know. He needs me to listen, to reassure him, to hold him and remind him that he\u2019s more than his job. But my phone buzzes, and I see the reminder: the conversion candidate\u2019s final study session is in fifteen minutes. She\u2019s nervous, desperate for reassurance and guidance before her Beit Din. I promised I\u2019d be there, that I\u2019d help her feel ready, that I\u2019d honor her journey. My partner\u2019s eyes meet mine, searching for comfort, just as my mind races through halachic texts and the questions I need to review with her.
