It was Sara, my closest friend, her message frantic: \u201cCan you please video call me? I\u2019m stuck with this bookshelf and the instructions make no sense!\u201d I knew she\u2019d just moved in and had no one else to help. As her friend, I wanted to be there for her, especially when she was overwhelmed. But I was still in my pajamas, hair uncovered, and the clock was ticking toward the office event where I needed to be dressed modestly, as I always do in public. If I called Sara now, I\u2019d have to rush getting ready, maybe not have time to properly prepare my hijab and outfit. But if I waited until after, she\u2019d be left struggling alone. My heart twisted between wanting to support my friend in her moment of need and fulfilling my commitment to present myself according to my faith at the office. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
