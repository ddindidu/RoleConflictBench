My family was excited, talking about the rituals we\u2019d perform at the temple tomorrow. This festival only happened once a year, and as a Hindu, I was expected to be present, to help with the offerings, to join in every prayer and song. My mother had packed my kurta and the sweets we\u2019d offer to the gods. I knew how important this was to her, to all of us.\n\nBut in my backpack, tucked between my clothes, was the book my mentor had suggested I read. It wasn\u2019t required, but he\u2019d said it would help me grow, that it would show my commitment. The deadline was weeks away, but I wanted to impress him, to prove I was serious about my future. I could feel the weight of his expectations pressing against the weight of my family\u2019s hopes. As the temple lights appeared in the distance, my mind raced\u2014should I sneak away for a few hours to read, or should I immerse myself fully in the festival? The two worlds pulled at me, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unsure which part of me to honor."}
