Our argument had spiraled out of control, and now she was questioning if we should even stay together. My heart pounded with the weight of her words, knowing she needed me to be present, to help us find a way through this. But as I tried to respond, my other phone buzzed insistently\u2014a reminder from the parish office. The Martinez family was waiting at the church, their child\u2019s sacrament only days away, and they needed me to lead the final preparation session. I could hear the children\u2019s laughter echoing faintly from the hall, and I knew the community expected me to be there, to guide and support them. Torn between the desperate need to save my relationship and my duty to my parish, I felt the pressure mounting, my mind racing as I tried to figure out how to be both the boyfriend she needed and the priest they expected."}
