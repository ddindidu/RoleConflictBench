My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had mentioned she\u2019d have extra bags this week and asked if she could use some space in my bin. As a neighbor, I wanted to be considerate, to share the space and keep our street tidy. But my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the parish office. The Martinez family needed a last-minute, mandatory preparation session for their daughter\u2019s sacrament. As their priest, I was expected to lead and organize these classes, especially for such an important milestone. The session would run late into the evening, right when Mrs. Lee would need to put her trash out. I felt the tension rising inside me. If I left for the church now, I\u2019d miss Mrs. Lee and she\u2019d have nowhere to put her bags. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down the Martinez family and possibly jeopardize the child\u2019s preparation. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to do the right thing. I stood there, keys in hand, torn between the needs of my neighbor and my parishioners, unsure which door to walk through first."}
