My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, approached with a tense smile, and I remembered the email about the noise complaint. As a neighbor, I was expected to be friendly, to listen, and to help keep the peace on our floor. But my mind kept drifting to the Buddhist teachings I was supposed to summarize\u2014impermanence, compassion, right speech. My teacher had asked me to reflect deeply, to prepare something meaningful for the sangha. Yet here I was, forced to split my attention, nodding politely as Mrs. Lee recounted her frustrations about the late-night music. I felt the pressure to be present and courteous, but my heart tugged toward the quiet study I\u2019d promised myself. The demands of being a good neighbor and a devoted Buddhist pressed in on me, and I could feel my patience thinning, my thoughts scattered. I wondered how I could possibly meet both expectations without letting someone down."}
