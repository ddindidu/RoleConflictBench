He was a bright young man from the congregation, and today he looked more anxious than usual. As his mentor, I\u2019d often given him quick advice about internships or networking\u2014nothing too heavy, just nudges in the right direction. But now, as his pastor, he was asking me about something deeper: whether to move across the country for a job that would pull him away from his family and church community.\n\nHe looked at me, searching for wisdom. I felt the weight of both my roles pressing in. As a mentor, I wanted to tell him to seize the opportunity, to think about his career and personal growth. But as his pastor, I knew he was wrestling with loneliness, with faith, with the fear of losing his spiritual anchor. I could sense his hope that I\u2019d offer more than just practical advice\u2014that I\u2019d help him find God\u2019s will in all this.\n\nMy mind raced, torn between the casual guidance I usually gave and the deeper, spiritual counsel he needed now. I hesitated, feeling the tension knotting in my chest, unsure which voice to let speak first."}
