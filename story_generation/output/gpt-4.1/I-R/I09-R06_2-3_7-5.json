I glanced at the clock\u2014just an hour before the church service. As a Christian, I knew how important it was to be present, to worship together and help with the evening\u2019s community dinner. I\u2019d promised to bring dessert, and my absence would be noticed. But then I thought of Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor who lived alone down the hall. She always smiled when I brought her mail or checked in after a power outage. Tonight, with the threat of heavy rain and possible blackouts, I knew she might need someone nearby. My mind raced with the expectations: my church family counting on me, and Mrs. Lee possibly waiting for a knock on her door. I felt torn, guilt pressing from both sides, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
