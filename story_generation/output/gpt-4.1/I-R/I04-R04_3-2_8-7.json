His words are brief but heavy: \u201cThat joke really hurt me.\u201d My heart sinks. As a friend, I know I should call him immediately, apologize, and talk it through. We\u2019ve always promised to be honest and open, to never let misunderstandings fester. I reach for my phone, but before I can dial, another message pops up\u2014this one from Sister Fatima, a devoted member of our mosque. She\u2019s asking if I can meet her right away; her family is in crisis, and she needs spiritual guidance. As the imam, I\u2019m expected to be available, to listen and offer counsel when my community is in distress. I stare at my phone, torn. My friend needs me now, but so does my congregation. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I feel paralyzed, caught between the urgent needs of my heart and my calling."}
