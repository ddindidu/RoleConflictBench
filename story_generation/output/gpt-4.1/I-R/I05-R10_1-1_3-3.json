I was about to share a story from my own experience when I noticed someone quietly cutting in line at the counter. As a Hindu, I believe in upholding dharma\u2014doing what is right, even in small matters. My conscience nudged me to speak up, to gently remind the person about fairness. But as a mentor, I worried about setting the right example for Ravi. Should I interrupt our conversation to address the situation, risking embarrassment for the person and possibly making Ravi uncomfortable? Or should I let it go, focusing on Ravi\u2019s question and maintaining a relaxed atmosphere? The expectations of guiding my mentee and living by my ethical principles pulled me in opposite directions. I felt my heart race, caught between the urge to act and the desire to keep things simple for Ravi."}
