The deadline was tonight, and I knew that if I didn\u2019t finish, my teammate\u2019s work would be delayed, setting off a chain reaction of missed deadlines. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from Sister Agnes about the special healing service for Sister Maria, who had taken a turn for the worse. Attendance wasn\u2019t just expected; it was a matter of community, of faith, of being present for someone in need. My heart twisted. As a nun, I was called to prayer, to compassion, to putting others before myself. But as a colleague, I was relied upon to be dependable, to keep the team moving forward. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each with its own urgency. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between duty and devotion, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left undone."}
