I hadn\u2019t meant to hurt her, but my careless words had clearly stung. As her friend, I knew I should call her right now, apologize, and try to make things right before the misunderstanding grew. But the convent bell chimed, signaling the start of our monthly food drive. As a nun, I was expected to be present, helping to organize and distribute meals to those in need. The sisters were already gathering in the kitchen, their voices echoing down the hall, and I knew they counted on me to lead the prayers and coordinate the volunteers. My phone felt heavy in my hand. I could picture Maria alone, waiting for a sign that I cared enough to reach out. At the same time, I felt the weight of my commitment to the community, the expectation that I would put service above all else. My chest tightened as I stood frozen, torn between the urgent call of friendship and the sacred duty of service, unsure which voice to answer first."}
