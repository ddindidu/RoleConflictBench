It was our last weekend together before she left for her new job overseas, and I could feel the weight of every moment pressing down on us. I wanted to give her all my attention, to make these hours count, to show her how much she meant to me. My phone buzzed on the table, and I glanced at the screen. It was a message from Mark, a member of my congregation. He\u2019d been struggling lately, and now he was reaching out, asking if I had time to talk. I knew he wouldn\u2019t ask unless he really needed it. My heart twisted. Mia squeezed my hand, sensing my distraction. I could see the hope in her eyes\u2014that I would choose her, just this once, over everyone else. But I could also hear the silent plea in Mark\u2019s message, the expectation that I would be there for him as his pastor. I stared at my phone, torn between the woman I loved and the calling I\u2019d promised to honor, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds."}
