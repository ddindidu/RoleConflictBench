The clock ticked louder with every passing minute, reminding me how little time I had left. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014my friend Avi\u2019s name flashed. He\u2019d just moved into his new apartment and was struggling to assemble his bookshelf. \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m about to lose my mind with these instructions,\u201d he texted.\n\nAs a friend, I knew Avi needed me. He\u2019d always been there for me, and I wanted to be the person he could count on, especially now when he was overwhelmed and alone. But as a rabbi, I felt the weight of my congregation\u2019s expectations. They looked to me for guidance and inspiration, especially during Shabbat. The sermon wasn\u2019t ready, and I couldn\u2019t let them down.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the urgent needs of my friend and the sacred responsibility to my community. I felt the pressure mounting, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
