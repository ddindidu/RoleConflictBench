He confided in me about his mounting deadlines and how he felt overwhelmed, his eyes searching mine for guidance. As his mentor, I wanted to help him find balance, to encourage him to prioritize and grow, to be present for him in this moment of need. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the Friday sermon was only an hour away. Today was no ordinary Friday\u2014our community was celebrating a milestone, and people had come from distant towns to hear my words as their imam. The weight of their expectations pressed on me; I was to inspire, to lead, to honor this occasion with a sermon worthy of their journey. Yet here was Ahmed, needing my time and attention, and I felt torn. My heart ached with the desire to be fully present for both, but the clock ticked on, and I could feel the tension rising inside me, unsure which role to serve first."}
