As an acquaintance, I felt the familiar tug to be welcoming, to draw her into conversation, to help her feel at ease. I could almost hear my friends\u2019 voices in my head: \u201cYou\u2019re so good at making people feel comfortable.\u201d I wanted to live up to that, to be the friendly face she needed tonight.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: church service in thirty minutes. As a Christian, I was expected to be there, to worship, to show commitment to my faith and community. Missing a service wasn\u2019t just about me; it was about setting an example, about being present for others who might need me there. The weight of both expectations pressed on me\u2014one urging me to stay, the other to leave. My heart pounded as I glanced between the anxious newcomer and the clock, feeling the tension twist inside me, unsure which role I should honor in this moment."}
