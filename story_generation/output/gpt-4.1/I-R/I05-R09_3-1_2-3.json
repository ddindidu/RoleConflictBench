She looked at me, eyes wide with uncertainty, waiting for the guidance I was supposed to provide. As her mentor, I knew I needed to be thorough, to help her weigh every pro and con, to offer the kind of structured advice that could shape her entire career. But as we spoke, she reached into her bag and pulled out a box of cookies\u2014her favorite, she said, and offered me one with a hopeful smile. I hesitated. The cookies weren\u2019t kosher, and I always observed the dietary laws, even at work. The pantry was stocked with kosher snacks, but she didn\u2019t know, and I didn\u2019t want to make her feel awkward or rejected in this vulnerable moment. I could see she wanted to connect, to share something simple and human before we dove into the heavy decisions. My mind raced, torn between my commitment to my faith and my responsibility as her mentor to be present, open, and supportive."}
