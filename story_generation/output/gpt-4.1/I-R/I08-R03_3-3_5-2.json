The mayor\u2019s urgent voice still echoed in my mind\u2014hundreds of people needed shelter, food, and comfort after the hurricane. As a nun, I was expected to lead the relief effort, to be present for those who had lost everything. But the message on my phone was from Clara, an old acquaintance. Her car had broken down on a deserted road, and she sounded scared. She asked if I could come help her, just this once. I knew she didn\u2019t have anyone else nearby. My heart twisted. As an acquaintance, I was expected to offer support, to be there when someone reached out in need. But the community was counting on me, too. I stared at my phone, torn between the desperate plea of one and the silent suffering of many, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which path to take."}
