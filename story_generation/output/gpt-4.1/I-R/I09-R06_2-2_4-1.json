I winced, knowing how much she valued her peace and quiet. As a neighbor, I\u2019m expected to keep the shared spaces calm and respect everyone\u2019s boundaries. But my dog, anxious and protective, makes that difficult. I\u2019ve tried training, but he still reacts to every footstep.\n\nThis morning, Mrs. Lee knocked on my door, her face tight with frustration. She asked if I could keep my dog quiet, especially during her afternoon rest. I nodded, apologizing, but inside I felt torn. As a Christian, I\u2019m called to be patient, compassionate, and understanding, to love my neighbor as myself. But I also feel defensive\u2014my dog is part of my family, and I want to protect him too.\n\nNow, I sit on my couch, wrestling with what to do. Should I confine my dog, risking his anxiety, or risk upsetting Mrs. Lee further? I pray for guidance, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure how to honor them both."}
