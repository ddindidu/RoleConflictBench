As his girlfriend, I knew I should be the one to break the silence, to smooth things over before it grew into something bigger. He glanced at me, waiting for me to say something, to resolve it like I usually do. But my stomach rumbled, reminding me of another pressing concern. We hadn\u2019t eaten since morning, and now, in this unfamiliar city, the only place I could eat was the tiny kosher vendor at the corner. He wanted to try the bustling food market across the street, filled with smells and flavors I couldn\u2019t touch. I saw the disappointment flicker in his eyes when I hesitated. I felt torn\u2014between the expectation to be the understanding, easygoing girlfriend who could compromise, and my commitment to keeping kosher, a part of my Jewish identity I couldn\u2019t just set aside. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give without letting the other down. I stood there, caught between his hopeful gaze and the small kosher sign, unsure which way to turn."}
