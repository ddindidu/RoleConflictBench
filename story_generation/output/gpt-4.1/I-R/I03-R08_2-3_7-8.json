We\u2019d argued three times this week about money\u2014how we spend it, how we save it, and whether we\u2019re even on the same page. As his girlfriend, I know I should reach out, try to resolve things, show him I care enough to fix what\u2019s broken between us. But my mind keeps drifting to the letter from the doctor, the one that says my health might not allow me to travel much longer. My parents have been saving for years so I could perform Hajj, and this year might be my only chance. As a Muslim, I feel the weight of this obligation, the longing to fulfill a pillar of my faith. But if I leave now, with things so tense between Amir and me, will it look like I\u2019m running away? My heart aches with the pressure\u2014torn between mending my relationship and answering a call that feels bigger than myself. I stare at the phone, unable to move, caught between two worlds that both demand all of me."}
