As a mentee, I knew I should reach out to my mentor and explain the technical hurdle that had me stuck, but I hesitated, not wanting to seem incapable. My phone buzzed with a message from Brother Ahmed, a gentle reminder that he\u2019d like to talk whenever I had a moment. As the imam, I was expected to be available, to offer guidance and a listening ear, especially when someone reached out for help. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my mentor expected transparency and initiative, while my community needed my presence and support. My mind raced, torn between sending an email to my mentor admitting my struggle, or calling Brother Ahmed to fulfill my duty as his spiritual guide. The clock ticked on, and I sat in the tension, heart pounding, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
