Today, I\u2019m expected to lead a critical training session, one where every detail matters and any misstep could have serious consequences for the project. My mentees look to me for confidence and clarity, and I know I must be fully present, approachable, and set an example.\n\nBut this afternoon, the company is hosting an office function\u2014a rare chance for the whole team to bond, including colleagues from other departments and all genders. The invitation specifically mentions a \u201cbusiness casual\u201d dress code, and I know from past events that most people interpret this as short sleeves and relaxed attire. As a Muslim, I am committed to dressing modestly, covering my arms and legs as part of my faith. I worry that my choice of clothing will make me stand out, perhaps even seem distant or unapproachable to those I\u2019m supposed to mentor.\n\nI feel the weight of both roles pressing on me. I want to be the mentor my team needs, blending in and making everyone comfortable, but I also want to honor my beliefs. The expectations seem to pull me in opposite directions, and as the clock ticks closer to the event, I find myself torn, unsure which part of myself to prioritize."}
