Our argument from last night still hung in the air, raw and unresolved. He wanted to talk, to try and fix things before they slipped too far, and I knew how much it mattered to him that I show I cared enough to stay and work through it. But just as I was about to reply, my phone rang\u2014a call from the synagogue. They needed one more person for the minyan at a funeral prayer, and without me, the service couldn\u2019t go on. I could hear the urgency in the rabbi\u2019s voice, the weight of tradition and community pressing on me. My heart pounded as I stared at the two messages, feeling torn in half. I wanted to be the girlfriend who didn\u2019t walk away in a crisis, but I was also the Jew who couldn\u2019t let down her community in a moment of need. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I felt the ache of not knowing which part of myself I was supposed to choose."}
