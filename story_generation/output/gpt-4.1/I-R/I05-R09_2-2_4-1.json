Tomorrow, my mentees would gather, eager for the session I\u2019d promised\u2014one that would give them the skills they needed before the big project deadline. I\u2019d spent hours preparing slides, examples, and exercises, determined to give them my best. But as I reviewed my notes, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the Jewish holiday was just days away. My children still hadn\u2019t learned the blessings or the stories behind the traditions. I could hear their laughter from the next room, a reminder of my responsibility to pass on our heritage, to make sure they understood the meaning behind the rituals. My mind raced, torn between the structured mentorship session and the urgency of teaching my children about our faith. Both roles demanded my full attention, both felt essential. I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, wondering how I could possibly choose between guiding my mentees and nurturing my children\u2019s Jewish identity."}
