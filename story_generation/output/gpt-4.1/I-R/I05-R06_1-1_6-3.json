She confessed she was overwhelmed, her deadlines piling up, her weekends swallowed by work. As her mentor, I felt the urge to guide her, to help her carve out time for herself, to encourage her to set boundaries and prioritize her well-being. I wanted to model balance, to show her that growth meant more than just professional achievements.\n\nBut as I listened, my mind drifted to the church bells I hadn\u2019t heard in weeks. Sunday worship was a cornerstone of my faith, a time to reconnect with God and my community. Yet, lately, I\u2019d been telling myself I\u2019d go \u201cwhen time allows,\u201d always finding reasons to skip. Now, as I urged Jamie to make time for what mattered, I felt a pang of guilt. How could I encourage her to prioritize her values when I was neglecting my own? The expectations of being a supportive mentor and a committed Christian pressed in on me, each demanding more than I seemed able to give. I sat in silence, wrestling with the advice I wanted to give and the example I was actually setting."}
