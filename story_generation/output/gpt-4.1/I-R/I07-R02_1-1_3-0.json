The project report was due in three days, but I knew there was plenty of buffer time. My colleagues could continue their work without my section for now, and no one seemed particularly anxious about the deadline. Still, I felt the unspoken expectation to stay on top of my tasks, to be reliable and efficient.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder: the daily prayer service at the chapel was about to begin. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead these prayers, even though today\u2019s service was routine and optional. I knew some members found comfort in my presence, even on quieter days.\n\nI stared at the screen, torn. If I left my desk now, I\u2019d fall a little behind, but nothing critical. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the chance to be there for those who might need spiritual support, even if only a handful attended. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I found myself frozen, wrestling with which part of myself to honor in this moment."}
