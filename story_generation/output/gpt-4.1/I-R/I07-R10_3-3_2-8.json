This was the final team discussion before we locked in the project\u2019s direction, and my manager had stressed how important everyone\u2019s input was. As a colleague, I was expected to be there, to contribute, to show my commitment to the team. But I was already on a train, heading across the state to my family\u2019s village. The festival was one of the most important in our tradition, and my parents had been clear: I was needed for the rituals, to help with the offerings, to be present in every sense. My mind raced with the weight of both expectations. If I missed the meeting, would my team see me as unreliable? If I skipped the festival, would my family feel I was turning my back on our faith? The train rattled on, and I felt the pressure building inside me, torn between two worlds that both demanded all of me."}
