I knew how much she needed someone to listen, to guide her gently back to hope. Just as I was gathering my thoughts, my phone buzzed. It was Mia, my oldest friend, her message frantic: \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m surrounded by planks and screws and I have no idea what I\u2019m doing.\u201d I could picture her, overwhelmed and alone in her new apartment, needing the comfort of a familiar face and a steady hand.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. As a nun, I was expected to be present, calm, and focused for those seeking spiritual guidance. As a friend, I was supposed to drop everything and help, especially when Mia rarely asked for anything. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the sacred duty of my calling and the loyalty of lifelong friendship. I stared at my phone, torn, the seconds ticking by as I wrestled with what to do next."}
