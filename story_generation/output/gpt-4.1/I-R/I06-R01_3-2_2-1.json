The deadline was clear\u2014this had to be done before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation. My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cThis is your chance to show upper management your commitment.\u201d I knew how much was riding on this, not just for me, but for the trust my mentor had placed in me.\n\nJust as I tried to focus, my phone buzzed. It was Sarah from church, her message urgent: \u201cCan you talk? I really need guidance tonight.\u201d As a pastor, I knew what was expected of me\u2014compassion, presence, wisdom. Sarah was facing a life-altering decision, and she was reaching out in her moment of need. I could hear the desperation in her voice when I called her back.\n\nMy mind raced. If I turned her away, I\u2019d fail her as a pastor. If I set aside my assignment, I\u2019d let down my mentor and risk my own future. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between two worlds, unable to move."}
