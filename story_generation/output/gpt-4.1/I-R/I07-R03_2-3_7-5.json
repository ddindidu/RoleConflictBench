My inbox pinged again\u2014another message from Mark, politely reminding me that the group needed my input before they could move forward with the project. I knew the expectation: as a reliable colleague, I should respond quickly, keep the workflow smooth, and not hold anyone back. But my phone buzzed with a different reminder: Sister Agnes had just texted, confirming that I was to lead tonight\u2019s prayer vigil at the cathedral. It was a great honor, and as a nun, I was expected to be present, focused, and spiritually prepared, especially when representing the convent at such a public event. My heart pounded as I glanced between the urgent work emails and the prayer book on my desk. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my colleagues counting on my efficiency, my sisters counting on my devotion. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me as the minutes ticked by."}
