My mentor had always encouraged me to reach out whenever I hit a snag, no matter how small. Tonight, a minor question about terminology lingered in my mind\u2014not urgent, but it tugged at me, a reminder of my responsibility as a mentee to communicate openly. Yet, the evening stretched before me, calm and unhurried, a rare chance to recite and reflect on the Quran without distraction. As a Muslim, I cherished these moments, feeling closest to Allah when I could immerse myself in His words. But the expectation to be a proactive mentee pressed against my desire for spiritual reflection. Should I send a quick message to my mentor, risking the intrusion of work into this sacred time? Or should I set aside my mentee duties, just for tonight, to nourish my faith? The two roles pulled at me, each demanding my attention, and I felt the tension knotting quietly in my chest as I weighed what to do next."}
