We both had a rare stretch of free evenings this week, and she wanted to make the most of it. As her boyfriend, I knew how much these moments meant to her\u2014and to me. She always said quality time was her love language, and I wanted to show her she was a priority. But as I typed out my reply, my mind wandered to the savings app on my phone. Every extra dinner out, every spontaneous date, meant a little less set aside for Hajj. My parents reminded me often: as a Muslim, performing the pilgrimage was a duty, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d start saving early, even if it meant small sacrifices now. I felt torn, caught between the warmth of Sara\u2019s laughter and the quiet pull of my faith. Could I really ask her to understand, to wait, when all she wanted was a simple evening together? My thumb hovered over the keyboard, heart heavy, unsure which part of myself I\u2019d have to let down."}
