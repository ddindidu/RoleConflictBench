She confessed she was overwhelmed, her coursework and part-time job colliding, leaving her exhausted and behind. As her mentor, I felt the urge to help her map out a plan, maybe even stay late to guide her through her schedule. I knew how much she needed support right now, and I wanted to be there for her, to encourage her growth and help her find balance.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. The monthly food drive at the convent was about to begin. As a nun, I was expected to be present, working alongside my sisters to serve the homeless. The community relied on us, and my absence would be noticed. I could already imagine Sister Agnes\u2019s gentle but firm reminder about our commitment to charity.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. Maria\u2019s anxious eyes pleaded for guidance, while the distant sound of volunteers gathering in the hall reminded me of my duty. I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice between nurturing one soul and serving many."}
