I\u2019m really lost.\u201d I know she\u2019s been anxious about her future, and as her mentor, I want to be there for her, to offer the guidance she expects from me. But as I start to type a reply, I glance at the Quran on my shelf. The community study circle is meeting in less than an hour, and tonight\u2019s discussion centers on verses I haven\u2019t yet read or reflected upon. As a Muslim, I\u2019m expected to come prepared, to engage deeply with the text, and to contribute thoughtfully. My mind tugs in two directions\u2014toward the responsibility I feel for my mentee\u2019s uncertainty, and the spiritual commitment I owe to my faith and community. The clock ticks on, and I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in, each demanding my time and presence, each too important to ignore."}
