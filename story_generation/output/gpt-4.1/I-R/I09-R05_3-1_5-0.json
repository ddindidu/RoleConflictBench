My mind kept drifting, though, to the corridor outside my apartment. My neighbor, Mrs. Feldman, had left a small bench and a few potted plants in the hallway again. The HOA had sent out a notice: an inspection was coming, and anything blocking the emergency exit would be cited. As a neighbor, I felt responsible for keeping our shared space safe and compliant, but I also knew how much those plants meant to Mrs. Feldman\u2014she\u2019d told me they reminded her of her late husband.\n\nMeanwhile, the pressure to prepare a meaningful sermon weighed on me. My congregation expected inspiration and guidance, and I wanted to give them my best. But every time I tried to focus, the thought of the inspection and Mrs. Feldman\u2019s plants tugged at my conscience. Should I knock on her door and ask her to move them, risking hurt feelings? Or should I let it go, hoping the inspector would overlook it? The demands of being a good neighbor and a devoted rabbi pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, torn, unable to move forward with either task."}
