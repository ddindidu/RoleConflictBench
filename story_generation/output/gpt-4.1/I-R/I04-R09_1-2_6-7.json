My friend texts, \u201cWhere are we meeting? I\u2019m lost.\u201d I know she\u2019s anxious, and I promised I\u2019d help her feel comfortable in this new city. We always said we\u2019d be honest and clear with each other, especially when things get confusing. But as I start to type a reply, I hear the cantor\u2019s voice echo through the synagogue. My turn to chant is coming up\u2014everyone expects me to be ready, focused, and present. I\u2019ve practiced for weeks, and my family is counting on me to honor this commitment. My phone buzzes again. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the need to be a reliable friend, to clear up this misunderstanding, and the responsibility to my community and faith. My hands tremble as I hold my phone, torn between sending a quick message and tucking it away to prepare for my part in the service. The seconds tick by, and I can\u2019t escape the feeling that, no matter what I do, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
