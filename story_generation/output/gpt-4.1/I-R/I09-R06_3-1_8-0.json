She\u2019d asked me to keep an eye out for her deliveries, especially with the planned power outage looming. \u201cJust make sure nothing sits outside too long,\u201d she\u2019d said, trusting me as a good neighbor should. I wanted to help, to be reliable and kind, as I always tried to be.\n\nBut as I opened her door to check for packages, I noticed a small envelope on her table, half-opened, with cash visible inside. I hadn\u2019t meant to see it, but now I couldn\u2019t unsee it. My Christian values told me to respect her privacy, to avoid even the appearance of wrongdoing. Yet, as her neighbor, I was supposed to make sure everything was safe, especially with the power out and the building so quiet. Was it right to ignore what I\u2019d seen, or should I mention it to her, risking her trust? My heart pounded as I stood in her entryway, torn between being a trustworthy neighbor and living up to my Christian ethics."}
