It was Sam, my closest friend, her voice trembling as she asked if I could talk. She\u2019d just had a terrible fight with her partner, and I could hear the tears she was trying to hold back. I knew what she needed\u2014someone to listen, to be present, to help her untangle the pain. That\u2019s what friends do, and I wanted to be there for her, to offer comfort and understanding.\n\nBut today was the monastery\u2019s annual festival, the one day each year when the whole community gathered before sunrise. I\u2019d promised to help with the preparations, to chant, to serve tea, to be part of something bigger than myself. The monks were counting on me, and I felt the weight of that commitment pressing on my chest.\n\nI stood in the quiet hallway, phone in hand, torn between the urgent need in Sam\u2019s voice and the silent expectation of my Buddhist community. My heart ached as I tried to decide where I was needed most, feeling the pull of both worlds and the pain of not being able to give myself fully to either."}
