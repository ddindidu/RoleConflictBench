As his girlfriend, I wanted to reach out, to listen, to offer comfort after his long day. He needed me to be present, to reassure him that his worries mattered. But my laptop hummed on the coffee table, open to the half-finished sermon I needed to complete for Sunday. As a pastor, my congregation expected guidance, clarity, and a message that would help them navigate their own struggles. The weight of their needs pressed on me, reminding me that I was supposed to be a moral compass, a source of wisdom. Mark glanced at me, his lips parting as if to speak, but I caught the time on my screen and felt a pang of guilt. I wanted to be everything for him, but I also couldn\u2019t let my church down. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my full attention, and I sat frozen, torn between the person I loved and the calling I had promised to fulfill."}
