As a colleague, I knew how important this meeting was\u2014our final chance to weigh in before the project\u2019s direction was set in stone. My manager had emphasized the need for everyone\u2019s input, and I didn\u2019t want to let my team down or seem disengaged. But my phone buzzed again, this time with a message from a church member: a family in our congregation had just lost their home in a fire. As their pastor, I was expected to be there, to offer comfort, organize immediate support, and help them navigate the first shock of loss. My heart ached for them, and I knew how much my presence would mean. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014my colleagues counting on my expertise, my community needing my compassion. I felt torn, anxiety rising as I tried to figure out how to be present for both, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
