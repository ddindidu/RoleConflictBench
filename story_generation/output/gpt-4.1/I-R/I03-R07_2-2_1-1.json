He\u2019d just come home, voice trembling as he recounted the harsh feedback from his boss. I wanted to hold him, to listen, to reassure him that he was more than his job. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the memorial service at the temple was tonight. As a practicing Buddhist, I was expected to be there, to help set up, to chant with the community, to honor those who had passed. My teacher had emphasized the importance of presence and support during these ceremonies, especially when so many would be attending. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the man I loved, who needed me now more than ever, and toward my spiritual community, who counted on my commitment. My chest tightened as I tried to decide where I was needed most, guilt and worry swirling inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
