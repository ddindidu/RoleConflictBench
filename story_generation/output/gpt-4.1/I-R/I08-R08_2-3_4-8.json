He needed help moving boxes to his new apartment this weekend, and he\u2019d specifically reached out to me. As an acquaintance, I knew the unspoken rule: when someone asks for help, you show up. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, \u201cBe there for people, even if you\u2019re not close.\u201d But my mind kept drifting to the letter from the doctor, the one that said my health might not allow me to travel much longer. This year\u2019s Hajj could be my last chance to fulfill a pillar of my faith. The dates overlapped\u2014Amir\u2019s move and the pilgrimage. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing on my chest. Amir would be disappointed if I let him down, and I\u2019d feel guilty for not helping. But missing Hajj, when it might be my only chance, felt like turning my back on something sacred. My thumb hovered over the reply button, my heart pounding as I wrestled with what to say."}
