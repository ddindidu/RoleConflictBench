He\u2019d been clear: \u201cHave this ready before our next meeting in three days.\u201d I wanted to impress him, to show I was committed and capable. But as I glanced at my phone, a reminder popped up\u2014church service tomorrow, followed by the community outreach I\u2019d promised to help with. As a Christian, I knew how important it was to be present, to worship and serve alongside my church family. They counted on me, and I believed in the value of showing up, of living my faith in action.\n\nBut the code wasn\u2019t going to write itself. If I spent the whole day at church, I\u2019d lose precious hours. My mentor expected dedication, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down. Yet, skipping church felt like turning my back on my faith and my community. The pressure built inside me, a knot of anxiety tightening in my chest. I wanted to be a good mentee and a faithful Christian, but right now, it felt impossible to be both."}
