My mentor had finally found a slot for our session\u2014just one hour before her flight, squeezed in at the last minute. She\u2019d emphasized how hard it was to make time, and I knew how much she expected me to show up, prepared and respectful of her schedule. But as I checked the time, my stomach twisted. That same hour, I was supposed to be at synagogue, chanting my assigned Torah portion. I\u2019d practiced for weeks, and the rabbi and my community were counting on me. Missing it would let them down, and I felt the weight of my commitment as a Jew pressing on me. I could almost hear my mentor\u2019s voice, patient but firm, reminding me how important it is to honor commitments and seize opportunities. At the same time, I pictured the congregation waiting for me, the rabbi\u2019s encouraging nod. My mind raced, torn between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each representing a part of who I am. I sat frozen, unable to move, the minutes ticking by as I wrestled with what to do."}
