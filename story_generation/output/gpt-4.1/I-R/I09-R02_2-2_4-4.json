I peered out to see Mr. Lee, my neighbor, wincing as he hurried past our door. I know the walls are thin, and Max\u2019s barking has been a sore point for the building. As a neighbor, I feel the weight of their unspoken frustration, the expectation that I\u2019ll keep the peace and respect our shared space. But as a priest, I\u2019m also expected to be present and attentive, especially for someone like Mrs. Evans, who\u2019s coming to me for comfort and guidance. The guilt gnaws at me\u2014should I reschedule with Mrs. Evans to address the noise and apologize to Mr. Lee, or do I trust that my calling to help her must come first? My mind races, torn between the needs of my neighbor and the needs of my flock, both expecting something I\u2019m not sure I can give at the same time."}
