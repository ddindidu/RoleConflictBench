Our argument from last night still hung in the air, unresolved, and now she was questioning if we should even stay together. As her boyfriend, I knew I should be reaching out, trying to fix things, but my mind kept drifting to my son in the next room, struggling to recite his Torah portion for his upcoming bar mitzvah. My father\u2019s voice echoed in my head, reminding me how important it is to pass down our traditions, to make sure my son feels the weight and pride of our history. But Rachel\u2019s pain was real, and I could feel her slipping away. I wanted to be the partner who could resolve conflicts, who could make her feel heard and loved, but I also needed to be the father who guides his child through this milestone. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I felt paralyzed, torn between the two people who needed me most, unsure which role to answer first."}
