We\u2019ve been fighting all week about money\u2014he says I spend too much, I say he\u2019s too controlling. As his girlfriend, I know I should try to resolve things, maybe call him before the office function and talk it out. But my phone sits silent on the bed, and I can\u2019t bring myself to pick it up yet.\n\nMeanwhile, the office function looms. It\u2019s a big deal\u2014everyone will be there, including my boss. I know I have to dress modestly, as my faith expects, but I also know my colleagues will be in business suits and cocktail dresses. I worry about standing out, about the stares and the questions. I want to fit in, to be seen as part of the team, but I also want to honor my beliefs.\n\nMy heart pounds as I try to choose an outfit that feels right, my mind torn between the need to fix things with Amir and the anxiety of facing my colleagues. I feel pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
