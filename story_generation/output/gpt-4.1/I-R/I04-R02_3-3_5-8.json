I glanced at the screen\u2014my friend\u2019s name flashed, and when I answered, their voice trembled with panic. Their car had broken down on the highway, miles from town, and they needed me. I promised I\u2019d see what I could do, but as I hung up, my eyes fell on the stack of materials for the class. The family had been insistent: this was the last chance before their child\u2019s big day, and they were counting on me to guide them through the final steps. I could hear the children\u2019s laughter echoing from the hall, waiting for me to begin. My friend\u2019s voice replayed in my mind, desperate and scared, while the weight of my priestly duty pressed on my shoulders. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the friend who needed me now, and the community that depended on my presence and guidance. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, lesson plan in the other, caught between the urgent call of friendship and the sacred trust of my vocation."}
