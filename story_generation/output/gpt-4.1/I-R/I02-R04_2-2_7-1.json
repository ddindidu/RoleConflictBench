We\u2019d argued again\u2014this time about how I\u2019d spent money on a new suit for Friday prayers instead of saving for our trip. She wanted to talk, to resolve things before the tension grew any worse. I knew I should go to her, listen, and try to make things right. That\u2019s what a good boyfriend does: he doesn\u2019t let problems fester.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee. The regular backup imam was out sick, and everyone was expecting me to lead Maghrib prayer tonight. The congregation would be waiting, looking to me for guidance and stability. As imam, I couldn\u2019t let them down, not when the community needed me most.\n\nMy heart pounded as I weighed the phone in my hand. Layla\u2019s words echoed in my mind, full of hurt and frustration, while the image of the waiting congregation pressed on my conscience. I felt pulled in two directions, each role demanding my presence, each expecting me to put them first. I closed my eyes, feeling the pressure build, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
