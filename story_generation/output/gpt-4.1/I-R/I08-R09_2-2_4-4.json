He\u2019d asked for my help last minute, and I\u2019d agreed, knowing it\u2019s what friends\u2014or even acquaintances\u2014do for each other. As we finished unloading the last box, Mark suggested grabbing lunch together as a thank you. I appreciated the gesture, but I knew the area well: only one small vendor nearby was kosher-certified, and I\u2019d already checked that it was open. Mark, however, was eager to try the new burger place across the street, raving about their menu. I could see he was looking forward to sharing a meal, and I didn\u2019t want to seem ungrateful or difficult after he\u2019d just moved. At the same time, I felt the familiar tug of my Jewish identity, the commitment to keeping kosher, and the discomfort of having to explain or possibly refuse. The expectations of being a supportive acquaintance and a committed Jew pressed in on me, and I stood there, caught between the two, unsure of what to say next."}
