The pressure was mounting; everyone was counting on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let the team down. Just as I was about to dive into the final numbers, another message popped up: a reminder about the office function this afternoon. It was a big event, with colleagues from every department and even some clients attending. The invitation mentioned a \u201cbusiness casual\u201d dress code, and I knew from past experience that most women would be wearing dresses or skirts, nothing like my usual long sleeves and loose trousers.\n\nI could already imagine the glances, the questions, maybe even the subtle jokes if I showed up in my modest attire. But skipping the event wasn\u2019t really an option either; my manager expected everyone to be there, and it was a chance to show team spirit. My mind raced, torn between the need to meet my work obligations and the desire to stay true to my faith. The clock ticked on, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which expectation I could afford to disappoint."}
