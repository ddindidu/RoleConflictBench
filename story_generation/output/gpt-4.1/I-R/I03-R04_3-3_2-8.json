My heart ached to see him like this, and I wanted nothing more than to hold him, to be his anchor in this storm. I reached for his hand, whispering words of comfort, trying to be the steady presence he needed. Just then, my phone buzzed. A message from the mosque: a woman had arrived, desperate for guidance after losing her father. As the imam, I was expected to be there, to offer solace and spiritual counsel to those in need. My mind raced\u2014my community relied on me, but so did Amir. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides. If I left Amir now, would he feel abandoned? If I stayed, would I be failing my duty as an imam? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, caught between the person I loved and the community that looked to me for hope."}
