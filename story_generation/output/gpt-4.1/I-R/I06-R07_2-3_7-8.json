My mentor had managed to squeeze in a short meeting for me this afternoon, despite a schedule that was already bursting at the seams. I knew how rare this opportunity was, and I felt the weight of expectation to show up prepared, focused, and grateful. At the same time, my Buddhist teacher had just asked me to summarize key teachings for tomorrow\u2019s temple session\u2014a request that filled me with both honor and anxiety. I needed quiet, undisturbed time to reflect and study, to let the teachings settle in my mind before I could share them with others. The two roles pulled at me from opposite directions: one demanded my presence and respect for another\u2019s time, the other required solitude and deep contemplation. My heart raced as I tried to imagine how I could possibly meet both expectations, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing minute."}
