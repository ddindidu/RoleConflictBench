My mentor had carved out a precious fifteen minutes for me between back-to-back meetings, and I knew how rare this opportunity was. I rehearsed my questions in my mind, determined to make every second count and not waste a moment of their time. As I hurried down the hallway, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a parishioner\u2014someone who rarely reached out\u2014asking if I might have a moment to talk, not now, but sometime soon. I could sense the vulnerability behind the casual words, the kind of gentle request that often masks deeper need. As a priest, I felt the weight of my calling: to be present, to listen, to offer comfort whenever it was sought. But as a mentee, I owed my mentor my full attention and respect for their schedule. My mind raced, torn between the urgency of honoring my mentor\u2019s time and the quiet, persistent tug of my pastoral duty. I stood in the corridor, phone in hand, caught between two worlds, feeling the pressure of both expectations pressing in on me."}
