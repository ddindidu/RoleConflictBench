She\u2019s really slipping.\u201d As an acquaintance, I felt the unspoken pressure to nod along, to join in the conversation and not seem aloof or judgmental. But I\u2019ve always tried to avoid gossiping or speaking ill of others, believing it only breeds negativity. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the monastery\u2019s annual festival preparations would begin at dawn tomorrow. As a Buddhist, I was expected to participate fully, to show my commitment to the community and help with the rituals. The festival was important, and I knew the monks counted on me. Yet, the thought of staying up late with my colleagues, maintaining these social ties, clashed with the early start and the peaceful mindset I needed for the ceremony. I felt torn, my mind pulled between the desire to be a good friend and the responsibility to my spiritual community, unsure which expectation I should honor."}
