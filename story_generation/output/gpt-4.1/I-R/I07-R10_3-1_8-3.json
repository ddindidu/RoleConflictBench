The leadership team needed me to confirm some details for an external partner, and they were waiting for my prompt reply. As a colleague, I knew the expectation: respond quickly, keep things moving, don\u2019t be the bottleneck. I opened my laptop, ready to type, when I noticed a coworker quietly slipping ahead in the cafeteria line, bypassing others who had been waiting. It was a small thing, but as a Hindu, I was raised to value dharma\u2014doing what\u2019s right, even in small matters. I felt a tug inside, a responsibility to speak up or at least gently remind my coworker about fairness. But the clock was ticking, and the team was counting on me for a fast response. My mind raced, torn between the urge to uphold my ethical principles and the pressure to meet my professional obligations. I stared at my screen, heart pounding, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
