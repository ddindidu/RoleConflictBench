My phone buzzed. It was Alex, my old college friend, his message popping up: \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m losing my mind with this IKEA bookshelf.\u201d I could almost hear the frustration in his words. As a friend, I knew he counted on me to help out, especially when he was stressed or overwhelmed. But at the same time, my Buddhist friend had just sent a thoughtful message, asking if I had time to discuss the sermon we both attended last weekend. He valued these conversations, and I knew how important it was to him\u2014and to my own practice\u2014to engage in spiritual study and reflection. I stared at my phone, feeling the pull in two directions. My heart ached with the urge to be there for Alex, but I also felt the weight of my commitment to my spiritual path and my Buddhist friend. The demands pressed in on me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which call to answer first."}
