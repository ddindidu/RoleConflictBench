My mentor expects me to reach out whenever I hit a wall, to communicate openly and promptly. I know I should send a message, explain the issue, maybe even ask for a quick call. But today is also the weekly group meditation, an hour I\u2019ve promised to dedicate to mindfulness and stillness. As a Buddhist, I value this time deeply\u2014it\u2019s a chance to reconnect, to practice letting go of stress and judgment. The group will be waiting, and I don\u2019t want to let them down or break my commitment to the practice. My phone buzzes with a reminder for the session just as I draft an email to my mentor. My mind tugs in two directions: the responsibility to my mentor, the responsibility to my practice. I feel the tension coil in my chest, torn between the urge to solve the problem and the need to sit in silence."}
