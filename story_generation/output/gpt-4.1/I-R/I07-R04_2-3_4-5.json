As a colleague, I knew the importance of my task\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish by noon, the next person in the chain would be stuck, and the whole project could stall. My phone buzzed with reminders from my team, their messages polite but urgent. At the same time, my other phone vibrated with messages from the mosque committee. Today was not just any Friday; it was the anniversary of our community\u2019s founding, and people had come from neighboring towns to hear my sermon. As the imam, I was expected to deliver words that would inspire and unite, and I could already picture the congregation gathering, waiting for me. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock. Both roles demanded my presence, both equally important, and I felt the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
