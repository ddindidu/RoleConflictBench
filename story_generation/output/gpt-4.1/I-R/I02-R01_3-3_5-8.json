The leaders are counting on you.\u201d My heart pounded. This was the last weekend before Emily left for her fellowship in London. She\u2019d been dropping hints all week\u2014her favorite movie, the little caf\u00e9 we loved, the way she squeezed my hand and said, \u201cI just want us to have some time, just us.\u201d I promised her we\u2019d make memories before she left, but now the church needed me too. They expected me to guide, to teach, to be present for those hungry for understanding. I could picture the eager faces of the community leaders, notebooks open, waiting for me to help them wrestle with faith. But I could also see Emily\u2019s eyes, searching mine for reassurance that she mattered most.
