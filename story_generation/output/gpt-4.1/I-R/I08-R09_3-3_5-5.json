It was Mark, an old college friend. His car had broken down on a quiet road nearby, and he sounded anxious. \u201cCan you come help? I don\u2019t know who else to call,\u201d he said. I glanced at the buffet table, my stomach rumbling. The event was running late, and I hadn\u2019t eaten since morning. The food looked delicious, but I noticed none of the dishes had kosher certification. I knew eating here would go against my commitment to keeping kosher, but if I left to help Mark, I\u2019d miss my only chance to eat for hours. As an acquaintance, I felt I should go to him right away, but as a Jew, I was torn\u2014do I break my dietary laws or ignore a friend in need? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, wrestling with what to do next."}
