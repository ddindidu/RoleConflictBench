As her acquaintance, I felt the urge to simply sit beside her, offer a gentle smile, and let her know I was there if she wanted to talk. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014just be present, no pressure, no expectations. But as her pastor, I felt a different pull. I knew she\u2019d been struggling with her faith lately, and I wondered if she was hoping for more than just a friendly ear. Should I offer a prayer, share a comforting scripture, or gently remind her of God\u2019s love? My mind raced with the weight of both roles. If I leaned in as her pastor, would I overwhelm her or make her feel judged? If I stayed only as her acquaintance, would I miss the chance to offer the deeper comfort she might need? My heart ached as I stood there, torn between the warmth of friendship and the responsibility of spiritual guidance, unsure which part of me she needed most in that moment."}
