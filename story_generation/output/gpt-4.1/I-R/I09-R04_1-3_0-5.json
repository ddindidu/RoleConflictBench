He looked tired, but I greeted him with a warm smile and a cheerful \u201cAssalamu alaikum.\u201d He paused, hesitated, and then quietly asked if I could spare a few minutes to help him move a heavy box.

People from neighboring towns were coming, expecting words of guidance and inspiration from me, their imam. My mind raced: as a neighbor, I wanted to be helpful and kind, to show the simple decency that builds trust.

I could see the hope in Mr. Rahman\u2019s eyes, but I also imagined the mosque filling up, the congregation waiting for me. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the quiet need of a neighbor and the public duty of my faith."}
