Our argument had spiraled, and now he was questioning if we should even be together. My heart ached, knowing I should call him, try to resolve things, show him I cared enough to fight for us. But just as I reached for the phone, the convent bell rang. Sister Maria\u2019s voice echoed down the hall, calling for volunteers. The family next door had lost everything in a fire; they needed food, clothes, comfort\u2014immediate help. As a nun, I was expected to put others first, to serve without hesitation. But as a girlfriend, I was expected to be present, to mend what was breaking between us. My hands trembled, torn between the urgent needs of strangers and the desperate plea of someone I loved. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I could feel myself splintering, unable to be fully present in either role."}
