The subject line was routine, and the message itself was clear: \u201cNo immediate action required, just keeping you in the loop.\u201d Still, I knew the unspoken expectation\u2014respond within a reasonable time, show you\u2019re engaged, be a good teammate. I slipped the phone back into my pocket, feeling the weight of my other role settle on my shoulders. It was almost time for the daily prayer, and though the congregation was small today, I was expected to lead. Yet, I also knew that Brother Ahmed was already inside, more than capable of stepping in. My mind raced: should I quickly reply to the email, maintaining my reliability at work, or focus on my duty as imam, even if my presence wasn\u2019t strictly necessary? The pressure of both expectations pressed in on me, and I hesitated at the mosque door, torn between the two worlds that demanded my attention."}
