Tomorrow was pickup day, and I knew Mrs. Patel next door always appreciated when I waited until the bins were truly full before dragging them out, so as not to clutter the shared alley. She\u2019d mentioned it kindly, but firmly, just last week. I wanted to be a good neighbor, to respect her wishes and keep our little corner tidy.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again with another message from the mayor. The hurricane had devastated so many families, and as a nun, I was expected to lead the relief effort\u2014organizing food, clothing, and shelter for those who had lost everything. Every minute counted, and I was needed at the church immediately. Yet, if I left now, the trash wouldn\u2019t get taken out, and Mrs. Patel would be disappointed. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in on me, the urge to serve my community battling with the desire to be a considerate neighbor. My hands trembled as I stood frozen, torn between the alley and the church, unsure which duty to answer first."}
