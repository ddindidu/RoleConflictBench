She confessed she was overwhelmed, her deadlines piling up, her energy fading. As her mentor, I felt the urge to stay late, help her map out a plan, and reassure her that growth often comes from these very struggles. I wanted to be present, to guide her through this moment, to show her she wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nBut tonight, the temple was holding a memorial service for a beloved elder. As a Buddhist, I was expected to attend, to chant, to support the grieving community. My absence would be noticed, perhaps even felt as a lack of respect or commitment. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one calling me to nurture an individual, the other to honor a collective tradition. I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, torn between the quiet needs of one and the solemn expectations of many. My heart wrestled with the choice, each path pulling me in a different direction."}
