He\u2019s been looking forward to it, and so have I\u2014just a quiet dinner, maybe a walk, a chance to talk without glancing at the clock. But as I\u2019m getting ready, my phone buzzes. The mosque committee reminds me that the regular backup imam is out of town, and everyone expects me to lead the evening prayer. I know how much the congregation relies on me, especially when there\u2019s no one else. My heart sinks. Amir\u2019s face lights up when I arrive, but I can\u2019t shake the weight pressing on my chest. I want to be present, to laugh and listen, but my mind keeps drifting to the mosque, to the people waiting for guidance and comfort. I feel torn in two\u2014one part longing to be the girlfriend Amir needs tonight, the other pulled by my duty as imam. The minutes tick by, and I can\u2019t ignore the growing tension inside me, knowing that whatever I choose, someone will be disappointed."}
