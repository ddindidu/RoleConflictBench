As a colleague, I knew the task I was working on was crucial\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish it by noon, the whole project would stall, and our client would be left waiting. My phone buzzed with reminders from my team, their messages polite but urgent. At the same time, my mind kept drifting to the mosque. It was Friday, and as the imam, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah. The congregation looked forward to my words, and I felt a deep responsibility to guide them. Yet, today, a guest speaker was ready and willing to step in. I could let him take the pulpit, but would that be letting down my community? My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my colleagues counting on me to deliver, my congregation trusting me to lead. The clock ticked on, and I felt the pressure mounting, torn between two worlds, each demanding a part of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
