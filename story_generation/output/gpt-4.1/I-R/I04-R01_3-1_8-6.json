Just an hour ago, I\u2019d made a careless joke at the community gathering, not realizing how it would land. Now, I\u2019d learned from another friend that my words had cut deep\u2014deeper than I\u2019d ever intended. As a friend, I knew what I had to do: call, apologize, and talk it through, honestly and openly. That\u2019s what friends do. But as a pastor, I was also expected to teach, to use moments like these to share religious principles, to guide others toward forgiveness and understanding. My friend had just mentioned a religious story, almost inviting me to step into my pastoral role. But would that feel like I was hiding behind my title, using faith as a shield instead of owning up to my mistake as a friend? The phone felt heavy in my hand. I could hear the laughter from the gathering still echoing down the hall, but inside, I was torn\u2014unsure which part of me should speak first."}
