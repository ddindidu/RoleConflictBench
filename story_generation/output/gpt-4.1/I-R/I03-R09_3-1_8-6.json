Our argument from last night still echoed in my mind\u2014sharp words, accusations, the kind of fight that makes you question everything. He wanted to talk, to try and fix things before they unraveled further. I knew, as his girlfriend, I should be there, ready to listen, to resolve the conflict before it became a chasm between us. But tonight was also Shabbat, and my family expected me at synagogue. It wasn\u2019t a high holiday, just a regular service, but my parents always said that consistency mattered, that showing up was a sign of commitment to our faith and community. I could hear my mother\u2019s voice: \u201cWe don\u2019t skip, not even when it\u2019s hard.\u201d My heart twisted, torn between the urgent need to save my relationship and the quiet, steady pull of tradition. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which part of myself I could let down."}
