I planned to sit by the window, recite and reflect on the Quran, and let the calmness settle in after a hectic few days. As I was about to begin, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, someone I knew from work. She was nearby and asked if she could stop by for a few minutes. When she arrived, her eyes were red and swollen, and she could barely speak through her tears. Instinctively, I wanted to comfort her, to listen and be the friendly, supportive acquaintance she needed. But as she poured out her heart, I felt a tug inside me\u2014the evening I had set aside for spiritual reflection was slipping away. I tried to focus on her words, but my mind kept drifting to the Quran on my desk, waiting for me. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself torn, unsure which role to honor in this moment."}
