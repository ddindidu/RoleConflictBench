She looked tired, her eyes red-rimmed, but she managed a faint smile. As her neighbor, I greeted her warmly, offering a simple hello and a smile, just as I always do. That\u2019s what\u2019s expected\u2014friendly, polite, nothing more. But as her pastor, I recognized the weight she carried. I knew her husband had been ill, and I\u2019d seen her in the back pew last Sunday, head bowed, shoulders shaking. I felt the urge to offer more than a neighborly greeting, to ask if she needed to talk, to offer a prayer or a comforting word. Yet, I hesitated, unsure if she wanted her private pain acknowledged in the hallway, unsure if she wanted her neighbor to become her pastor in this moment. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood there, torn, my heart wrestling with what to say next."}
