She had another question about the project, her eyes bright with curiosity. As her mentor, I felt a surge of responsibility\u2014I wanted to share everything I\u2019d learned, to guide her as my own mentors had guided me. I glanced at the clock. It was nearly dusk. My mind flickered to the small altar at home, the lamp waiting to be lit, the prayers I owed to the gods and to myself. My family expected me to keep the tradition alive, to honor our faith with daily rituals. But Priya\u2019s questions tumbled out, and I saw how much she relied on me. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of mentorship, the pull of devotion. I nodded as she spoke, but inside, I wrestled with the weight of both worlds, unsure which expectation I would let down tonight."}
