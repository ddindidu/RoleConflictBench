My heart ached with the weight of time slipping away. He wanted to spend the whole day, just us, making memories to hold onto. But as I got out of bed, the familiar pull of my Hindu rituals called to me. The incense, the chanting, the offerings\u2014each step a thread in the fabric of my faith, never missed, never rushed. My family expected me to honor every detail, especially on weekends when the rituals were longer and more elaborate. I could already hear my mother reminding me, \u201cNothing is more important than your dharma.\u201d Yet, my boyfriend\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, \u201cLet\u2019s make this day special, please.\u201d I felt torn, guilt pressing from both sides. If I shortened my prayers, I\u2019d betray my beliefs and disappoint my family. If I kept to my rituals, I\u2019d lose precious hours with him, maybe our last for a long time. My heart pounded as I sat between my prayer mat and my phone, unable to move, caught in the impossible space between love and duty."}
