She smiled warmly, pausing to chat, as she always does. I managed a quick hello, but my mind was already at the synagogue, where I was scheduled to chant a Torah portion in just a few minutes. Mrs. Green started telling me about her grandson\u2019s visit, her eyes bright with excitement. I felt the familiar tug\u2014my neighborly role urging me to listen, to be present, to show kindness. But the clock ticked louder in my head, reminding me of my commitment to my community, the expectation that I would be on time, prepared, and respectful of the service. My heart pounded with guilt as I weighed the warmth of a friendly conversation against the sacred responsibility waiting for me. I stood there, torn, feeling the pressure of both worlds pressing in, unsure which expectation I would let down."}
