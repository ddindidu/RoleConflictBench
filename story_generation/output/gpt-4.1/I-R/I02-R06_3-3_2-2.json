She clung to me, her grief raw after losing her brother so suddenly. As her boyfriend, I knew she needed me to be her rock, to comfort her, to say or do anything that would ease her pain. But as the night wore on, her sorrow turned to anger\u2014at God, at fate, at everything. She asked me to stay the night, to hold her, to help her forget, even if just for a moment. I could feel her desperation, her need for closeness, for something to fill the emptiness.\n\nBut my faith tugged at me. I\u2019d always promised myself to honor Christian values, to wait until marriage, to respect boundaries I believed were right. Now, those beliefs felt like a wall between us. Emily\u2019s pain was so real, and I wanted to do anything to help her, but I also felt the weight of my convictions. My heart ached as I wrestled with what she needed from me and what I believed was right. I could see the hope and vulnerability in her eyes, and I didn\u2019t know how to answer."}
