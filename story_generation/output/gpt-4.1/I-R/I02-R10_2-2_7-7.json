We\u2019re already running late for my cousin\u2019s puja, and my mother has called twice, reminding me to wear the kurta she picked out and not to forget the sweets. But my girlfriend sits on the edge of the bed, arms crossed, her eyes red from our argument about money\u2014again. I know as her boyfriend, I should stay, talk things through, and help us find some peace before I leave. She expects me to listen, to care, to not just walk out when things get hard. But as a Hindu, my family expects me to show up for the ceremony, to be respectful, to honor our traditions. I feel pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest. If I stay, I disappoint my family and disrespect the ceremony. If I go, I leave her alone with her hurt, breaking the promise I made to always be there. I stand in the hallway, kurta in hand, torn between the two worlds that both need me right now."}
