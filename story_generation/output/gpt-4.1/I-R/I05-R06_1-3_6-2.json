He confessed he\u2019d been overwhelmed, missing deadlines, and falling behind at work. As his mentor, I knew I should encourage him to find solutions, to push him toward growth and responsibility. But then he admitted he\u2019d been fudging his timesheets to cover up his lateness\u2014something he justified as a temporary fix until he got back on track.\n\nMy heart pounded. As a Christian, honesty is non-negotiable. I\u2019m called to live with integrity, to guide others toward truth, even when it\u2019s uncomfortable. But as a mentor, I\u2019m also supposed to support and empower, not judge or alienate. Jordan looked at me, searching for understanding, maybe even absolution. I could see how much he needed compassion, but I also felt the weight of my faith pressing on my conscience. The expectations of both roles clashed inside me, and I sat there, torn, unsure of which path to take."}
