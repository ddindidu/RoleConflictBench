It was Priya, her voice trembling. \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now.\u201d I could hear the pain in her words, and as her friend, I knew I should listen, offer comfort, and be there for her. But just as I was about to answer, I glanced out the window and saw something that made my heart pound\u2014a man in a suit was slipping an envelope to a city official, right in the open. I recognized the official; he\u2019d been in the news for shady deals before. As a Hindu, I\u2019ve always been taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, to act with integrity and courage, especially when I witness injustice. My mind raced. Priya needed me, but so did my conscience. I felt torn, my loyalty to my friend pulling me one way, my duty to dharma pulling me another. My hand shook as I held the phone, caught between two worlds, unsure which voice to answer first."}
