The deadline was weeks away, but I knew my mentor valued initiative and diligence. I wanted to impress her, to show I was committed and eager to learn. Yet, as I scrolled through the articles, my phone buzzed with messages from a friend. He was being treated unfairly by a group in our community, and the injustice gnawed at me. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act with compassion and courage when I saw wrong being done. My heart ached with the urge to help, to speak out, to be present for my friend. But the thought of disappointing my mentor, of falling behind on her expectations, weighed heavily on me. I felt torn, pulled in two directions\u2014one voice urging me to focus on my growth and responsibilities as a mentee, the other demanding I honor my values and support my friend. The conflict churned inside me, leaving me restless and uncertain about what to do next."}
