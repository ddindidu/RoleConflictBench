Just minutes ago, I\u2019d learned that a careless joke I made last night had really hurt my friend, Ahmed. He hadn\u2019t said anything at the time, but now I\u2019d heard from his brother that Ahmed was devastated. As his friend, I knew I needed to call him right away, to apologize, to explain myself, to try to fix what I\u2019d broken. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate, clear the air, make things right before wounds fester.\n\nBut as I stood in the mosque office, the clock ticked closer to Jummah. I was the imam, and the congregation was gathering. I was expected to deliver the sermon, to guide and inspire, to be present and focused. The guest speaker was ready, but I\u2019d promised the community I would speak today. They looked to me for leadership, for stability, especially in these uncertain times.\n\nMy phone buzzed in my hand. I could picture Ahmed waiting, hurting, maybe hoping I\u2019d reach out. I could also hear the growing murmur of the congregation, waiting for me to step up. My chest tightened as I weighed the demands of friendship against the expectations of my role as imam, torn between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
