The subject line is urgent: \u201cNeed confirmation for tomorrow\u2019s meeting with the partner.\u201d I know the leadership team is waiting on my reply to finalize the agenda, and I\u2019m expected to respond quickly\u2014anything less would be unprofessional. But as I sit at my desk, I hear the voices of a few adults gathering in the next room, waiting for the drop-in Torah class I\u2019m scheduled to teach. They\u2019ve come for guidance, for learning, and even though the class is optional, I know how much these moments mean to them. My laptop pings again, a reminder of the corporate world\u2019s relentless pace, while the gentle hum of conversation from the classroom tugs at my sense of spiritual responsibility. I feel the tension rising in my chest, torn between the immediate demands of my colleagues and the quiet, sacred duty to my community. My hands hover over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I wrestle with which role to honor first."}
