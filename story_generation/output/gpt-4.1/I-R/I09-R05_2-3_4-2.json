I rushed out, only to find Mrs. Goldstein from next door wincing as she tried to pass by. She gave me a tight smile and said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get any peace with all that noise.\u201d I apologized, feeling the weight of her expectation that I keep our shared space quiet and pleasant. But as soon as I closed the door, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the congregation is counting on me to deliver a meaningful sermon tonight. I glanced at my scattered notes, feeling the pressure to inspire and guide my community. My mind raced between calming my dog, respecting my neighbor\u2019s need for quiet, and the sacred responsibility of preparing words that might touch someone\u2019s soul. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, torn between the needs of my neighbor and the calling of my congregation."}
