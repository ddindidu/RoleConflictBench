He\u2019d been clear: \u201cHave this ready before our next meeting.\u201d I wanted to prove myself, to show I could handle the pressure and meet his expectations. But as I typed, my mind kept drifting to the small alarm I\u2019d set for my daily meditation. The gentle chime reminded me: ten minutes of mindfulness, a promise I\u2019d made to myself as a Buddhist. I knew the importance of this practice\u2014how it grounded me, how it was supposed to help me let go of stress, not add to it. Yet, the code deadline loomed, and I felt the weight of my mentor\u2019s trust. If I stopped now, would I fall behind? If I ignored my meditation, would I betray my own values? My chest tightened as I glanced between the code and the meditation cushion, torn between the demands of my mentor and the quiet call of my Buddhist practice."}
