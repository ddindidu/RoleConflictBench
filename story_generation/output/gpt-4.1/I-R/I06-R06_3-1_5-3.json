The project deadline was looming, and our arguments had reached a breaking point. As a mentee, I knew I should reach out to my mentor, let her know about the conflict, and ask for guidance. She always emphasized open communication, especially when things got tough. But it was Sunday morning, and I could hear the church bells ringing down the street. As a Christian, I felt the pull to attend worship, to be present in the community and find peace in prayer. I hadn\u2019t been to church in weeks, always telling myself I\u2019d go when I had more time. Now, with the project falling apart, I felt torn. Should I message my mentor right away, or set everything aside and go to church, trusting that faith would help me through? My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension twist inside me."}
