Can we talk?\u201d I know he\u2019s been feeling down lately, and as his friend, I want to be there, to listen and offer comfort. I start typing a reply, but then I glance at the clock\u2014ten minutes until Mrs. Evans arrives at the church office. She\u2019s been waiting weeks for this appointment, desperate for spiritual guidance about her ongoing family troubles. As a priest, I can\u2019t let her down; she\u2019s counting on me for counsel and support. But Mark\u2019s words tug at me, reminding me of the promise I made to always be there for him. My mind races, torn between the warmth of friendship and the solemn duty of my calling. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in, each demanding my presence, each deserving my full attention. My fingers hover over my phone, heart pounding, as I wrestle with which part of myself to honor first."}
