He smiled and asked if I could recommend a good restaurant nearby for his anniversary dinner. As an acquaintance, I felt the simple expectation to be helpful and friendly, to offer a suggestion without hesitation. But just moments before, during our group conversation, I had shared a story from scripture about gratitude and contentment, emphasizing the value of appreciating what we have rather than seeking luxury or extravagance. As a pastor, I\u2019m expected to model and teach these principles, to gently guide others toward spiritual reflection even in everyday choices.\n\nNow, Mark\u2019s request hung in the air. If I recommended the fanciest place in town, would I be contradicting the message I\u2019d just shared? If I suggested something modest, would I seem judgmental or out of touch with his celebration? I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between being a supportive acquaintance and a consistent spiritual guide. My mind raced, searching for the right words, as both roles pulled me in different directions."}
