But then I glance at the suitcase by the door, my partner\u2019s hand resting on it, his eyes searching mine. It\u2019s our last weekend together before he leaves for half a year. We\u2019d planned a quiet evening, just us, to savor every moment before the distance stretches between us.

I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the sacred responsibility to guide someone on their spiritual journey, and the tender, urgent need to hold onto love before it changes shape.
