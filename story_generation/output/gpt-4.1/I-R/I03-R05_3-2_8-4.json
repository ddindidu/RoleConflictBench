My boyfriend paces the living room, his words from our argument still echoing in my mind\u2014\u201cMaybe we\u2019re not right for each other.\u201d My heart aches, wanting to reach out, to fix what\u2019s broken between us, to be the girlfriend who listens, who heals, who doesn\u2019t let love slip away over harsh words and misunderstandings. But the clock ticks on, and I know a roomful of children and their parents are waiting for me at the synagogue, expecting their rabbi to guide them, to bring them wisdom and comfort, to be present and whole. I feel split in two, torn between the urgent need to save my relationship and the sacred responsibility to my community. My hands tremble as I try to decide which part of myself to honor, feeling the weight of both love and duty pressing in on me, demanding an answer I\u2019m not sure I can give."}
