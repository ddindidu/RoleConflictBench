She confessed she was falling behind at work, overwhelmed by deadlines and unsure how to prioritize. As her mentor, I felt the urge to guide her, to spend the afternoon helping her map out a plan, to encourage her growth and confidence. But as I listened, the convent bell echoed through the hall, a reminder of my other calling. Sister Agnes appeared at the door, her face grave\u2014news had come that the Ramirez family\u2019s home had burned down. The sisters were gathering food and clothing, preparing to visit them immediately. My heart twisted. The community expected my presence, my hands and prayers, in this urgent moment of charity. Yet Maria\u2019s eyes pleaded for guidance, for the time and care I promised as her mentor. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect."}
