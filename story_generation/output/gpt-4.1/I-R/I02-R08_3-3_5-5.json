My girlfriend smiled at me, her hand warm in mine. It was our last weekend together before she moved abroad, and she wanted to see what mattered most to me\u2014my faith. I wanted to spend every moment with her, to show her my world, to make memories before she left. But as we approached the main prayer hall for Friday prayers, I noticed her outfit: a sleeveless blouse and fitted jeans. She looked beautiful, but I knew the mosque had strict guidelines. As a Muslim, I was expected to ensure modesty, especially in sacred spaces. I felt torn\u2014my role as a boyfriend urged me to make her feel welcome and accepted, to avoid embarrassing her or making her feel judged. But my role as a Muslim weighed heavily, reminding me of the expectations of my community and my own beliefs. I hesitated, caught between wanting to honor her and needing to honor my faith, my mind racing as I tried to find the right words."}
