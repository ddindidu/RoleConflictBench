The HOA had sent out a notice: an inspection was coming, and anything blocking the emergency exit would be cited. As a neighbor, I felt responsible for keeping our shared space safe and orderly, but I also knew my neighbor was struggling, using the corridor for storage while saving up for a bigger place. I wanted to be considerate, not confrontational.\n\nAt the same time, my thoughts kept drifting to my own savings. As a Muslim, I felt the growing pressure to start putting money aside for Hajj. My parents reminded me often: it\u2019s a pillar of faith, a duty I must fulfill when able. But my salary barely covered rent and bills, let alone a pilgrimage. The idea of spending on anything extra\u2014like helping my neighbor rent a storage unit\u2014felt impossible.\n\nI felt torn, caught between the expectations of being a good neighbor and the religious obligation that weighed on my heart. The inspection was in two days, and I still hadn\u2019t decided what to do."}
