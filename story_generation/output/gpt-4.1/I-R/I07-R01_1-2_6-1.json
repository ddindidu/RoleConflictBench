It was from a colleague, just an update on a project, nothing urgent, but I knew the unspoken rule: respond promptly, show you\u2019re engaged, be a good teammate. I started to type a quick reply, but my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was waiting in the church office, her text trembling with anxiety\u2014she needed to talk, to find some light in a dark decision she faced. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My colleagues expected reliability, responsiveness, a sense of shared responsibility. But Sarah needed me to be present, to listen deeply, to offer more than just words. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my mind torn between the easy comfort of a quick email and the heavy responsibility of spiritual care. I could feel the tension rising in my chest, the impossible pull of two roles demanding different pieces of me at the very same moment."}
