We finally have time!\u201d My heart lifts. We\u2019ve both been so busy, and I know how much it means to him\u2014and to me\u2014to have an evening just for us. I start to type a reply, suggesting Thursday, when my calendar notification pops up: \u201cReligious School\u2014Thursday, 6:00 PM.\u201d My stomach tightens. As the rabbi, I\u2019m expected to teach the children\u2019s Torah class every week. The parents count on me, and the kids look forward to our sessions. Canceling or rescheduling isn\u2019t simple; it would disappoint families and disrupt the routine. But if I choose another night for our date, it won\u2019t be the same\u2014Thursday is the only evening he\u2019s truly free. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, the desire to nurture my relationship and the responsibility to my community. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between love and duty, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
