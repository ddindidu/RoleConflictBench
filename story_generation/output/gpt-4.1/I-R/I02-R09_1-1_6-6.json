She was upset that I hadn\u2019t confirmed our Saturday plans, and now she thought I was avoiding her. I knew as her boyfriend, I should call her, talk it out, and clear up the misunderstanding before it grew into something bigger. That\u2019s what a good boyfriend does\u2014he doesn\u2019t let small things fester. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized it was almost time for Shabbat services. My family expects me to go, and honestly, I expect it of myself too. It\u2019s not like the synagogue would fall apart if I missed one week, but I feel a tug of guilt at the thought of skipping. I could call Rachel now and risk being late, or I could go to services and let her stew in her frustration a little longer. My phone buzzed again. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the person I want to be for Rachel and the person I am in my community. My heart pounded as I weighed which expectation I\u2019d have to let down, knowing either way, I\u2019d disappoint someone\u2014maybe even myself."}
