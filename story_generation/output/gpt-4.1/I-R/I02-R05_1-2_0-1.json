She doesn\u2019t say much, but I can sense the tension in her posture, the way her fingers twist the edge of her sweater. As her boyfriend, I know she needs me to sit beside her, to listen, to offer comfort and warmth after her long day. But in the back of my mind, the clock is ticking. Shabbat is only a day away, and I haven\u2019t finished my sermon. As a rabbi, my congregation expects inspiration, guidance, and a message that will carry them through the week. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014my community relies on me, but so does Miriam. I want to be present for her, to show her she\u2019s not alone, but the words for my sermon swirl unfinished in my mind. I stand in the hallway, torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which need should come first."}
