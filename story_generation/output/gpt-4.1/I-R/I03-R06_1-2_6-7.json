He was upset that I\u2019d made plans with my friends for Saturday, not realizing he\u2019d wanted to spend the day together. My heart pounded with guilt and frustration. As his girlfriend, I knew I should call him, talk it out, and resolve this misunderstanding before it grew into something bigger. But just as I was about to dial, I noticed a message from Sarah in our group chat. She\u2019d been quiet lately, and now she was reaching out, finally admitting she was struggling and needed someone to talk to. As a Christian, I felt a deep responsibility to show her love and kindness, to be there for her in her time of need, just as Jesus would. But the weight of both expectations pressed down on me\u2014my boyfriend needed reassurance and understanding, while Sarah needed compassion and support. I sat there, torn, my phone heavy in my hand, wrestling with which call to make first."}
