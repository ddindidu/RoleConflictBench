We\u2019re not close, but there\u2019s an unspoken rule to smile, nod, maybe exchange a few friendly words. I straightened up, ready to greet him, when I noticed something odd\u2014he was hurriedly tucking a thick envelope into his bag, glancing around nervously. Through the open office door behind him, I caught a glimpse of our manager\u2019s desk drawer left ajar, and it clicked: Raj had just taken something that wasn\u2019t his. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, to act with integrity and courage, even if it\u2019s uncomfortable. But as an acquaintance, I\u2019m expected to keep things light, to avoid confrontation, to not make a scene. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014should I call him out, risking our fragile rapport and possibly causing a scandal, or should I just smile and walk by, pretending I saw nothing? My mind raced, torn between the urge to uphold my values and the pressure to maintain social harmony."}
