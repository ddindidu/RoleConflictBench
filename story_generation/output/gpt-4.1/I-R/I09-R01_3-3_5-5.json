The HOA inspection is tomorrow, and I know the rules\u2014nothing can block the exit. As her neighbor, I\u2019m expected to remind her, maybe even help her move them, to avoid a citation for both of us. But as I reach for my phone, it buzzes with a message from the church: a family in our congregation just lost their home in a fire. They need immediate support, and as their pastor, I\u2019m expected to organize counseling and gather supplies, to be present and comforting in their crisis. I stand in the hallway, torn. If I focus on the church, I risk upsetting Mrs. Lee and the HOA. If I handle the boxes, I delay my response to a family in real need. My mind races, guilt and responsibility pulling me in opposite directions, each role demanding my full attention, neither willing to wait."}
