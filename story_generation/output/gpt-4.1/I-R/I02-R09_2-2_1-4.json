She\u2019d just gotten off the phone with her boss, and the feedback had clearly stung. I wanted to be there for her, to listen, to maybe take her out for a comforting meal\u2014something warm and familiar, a little escape from her stress. But as we drove through the unfamiliar town, my stomach tightened. The only place I knew was kosher was a tiny vendor a few blocks away, and Rachel hated their food. She glanced at me, hopeful, suggesting we try the new Italian place she\u2019d spotted. I hesitated, feeling the weight of my own expectations pressing in: I couldn\u2019t just ignore the dietary laws I\u2019d kept my whole life, not even for her. But she needed comfort, and I was supposed to be her support. My mind raced, torn between the rules I lived by and the person I loved, both demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
