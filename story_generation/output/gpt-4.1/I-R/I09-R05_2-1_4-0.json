The quiet was suddenly broken by my dog barking loudly in the hallway\u2014again. I winced, knowing how thin the walls are and how Mrs. Feldman next door has mentioned her sensitivity to noise. As a neighbor, I feel responsible for keeping the peace, making sure my dog doesn\u2019t disturb others, especially in shared spaces. But as a rabbi, I\u2019m expected to devote time and deep thought to my sermons, to bring inspiration and comfort to my congregation. The barking grew louder, and I could hear footsteps outside\u2014someone passing by, probably startled. My mind raced: should I drop everything and calm my dog, or push through the distraction and keep working on my sermon? I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my attention in that moment."}
