My mentor\u2019s email blinked on my screen, reminding me of the optional reading he\u2019d suggested. The deadline was weeks away, but I knew he valued initiative and diligence. As his mentee, I wanted to impress him, to show I was committed and eager to learn. Yet, my mind kept drifting to Friday. I was the imam, and the congregation expected me to deliver the Khutbah. But this week, a guest speaker was ready, his sermon prepared and his presence welcomed by many. I could easily step aside, use the time to focus on my reading, and fulfill my mentor\u2019s expectations. But would that be shirking my duty as imam? The community looked to me for guidance, for consistency. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something different. My heart pounded as I stared at the unread book and the guest speaker\u2019s notes, torn between the desire to be a good student and the responsibility to lead my community."}
