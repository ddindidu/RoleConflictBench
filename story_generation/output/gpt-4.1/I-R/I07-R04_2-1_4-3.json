My team was counting on me; this report was the linchpin for the next phase of our project, and any delay would throw off the whole schedule. I could already imagine the disappointment in my colleague\u2019s voice if I didn\u2019t deliver on time. But as the minutes slipped by, my phone buzzed with a reminder: Friday prayers. As the imam, I was expected to lead the congregation, to offer guidance and inspiration. The community looked to me for stability, especially on Fridays. Today, though, we had a guest speaker ready to step in. I knew he was prepared, but some members might feel let down if I wasn\u2019t there. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my team and the responsibility to my congregation. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt the tension coil in my chest as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
