The HOA inspection was tomorrow, and I knew anything left in the hallway could mean a fine for all of us. As a neighbor, I felt responsible for keeping our shared spaces clear and safe, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d speak up if something like this happened. But as I rehearsed what I\u2019d say, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mrs. Ramirez. She was desperate: her son\u2019s sacrament was this weekend, and she needed me, as their priest, to lead a final preparation session tonight. She pleaded for my understanding, knowing how important this milestone was for their family. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one demanding I enforce boundaries for the good of the building, the other asking for compassion and flexibility in a moment of spiritual significance. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my neighbors and my calling to serve my parishioners. I stood in the hallway, caught between duty and empathy, unsure which path to take."}
