The topic was stewardship\u2014how to make wise, moral decisions with money. But my mind kept drifting back to the argument I\u2019d had with Emily last night. It was the third time this week we\u2019d fought about our finances. As her boyfriend, I knew I should reach out, apologize, and try to resolve things. She expected me to be understanding, to listen, to help us find a way forward together. But as a pastor, I felt the weight of my congregation\u2019s expectations. They looked to me for guidance, for clarity on how to live out their faith, especially in difficult areas like money. I could feel the tension building inside me, the pressure to be both a good boyfriend and a good pastor. I stared at the blank page, torn between picking up my phone to call Emily and forcing myself to write words that would help others, all while feeling like I was failing at both."}
