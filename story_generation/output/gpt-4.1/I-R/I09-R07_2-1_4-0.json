I knew my neighbors expected peace and quiet, especially in the evenings when everyone was winding down. I\u2019d already received a polite note last week, asking if I could keep my dog calm during those hours. Tonight, though, was the temple\u2019s monthly evening chant\u2014a ritual I rarely missed, one that grounded me and connected me to my Buddhist community. The thought of not attending made me uneasy, as if I were neglecting a part of myself. Yet, if I left, my dog might bark and disturb the neighbors, betraying their trust and the harmony we tried to maintain. I felt torn, the leash heavy in my hand, caught between the gentle pull of my spiritual obligations and the immediate, practical needs of those living just beyond my door."}
