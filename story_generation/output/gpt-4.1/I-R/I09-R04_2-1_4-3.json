I rushed out to find Mrs. Patel, my neighbor, standing by the shared door, her arms full of groceries and her face tight with frustration. She reminded me, not for the first time, that the noise was disturbing her elderly mother. I apologized, feeling the weight of my responsibility as a neighbor to keep the peace and respect our shared spaces. Yet, my mind was already occupied with the mosque\u2019s expectations. Today, I was scheduled to deliver the Khutbah, but the guest speaker was ready and willing to step in if I needed to handle something urgent. I stood in the hallway, torn between calming my neighbor\u2019s concerns and fulfilling my duty as imam. The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to do the right thing. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
