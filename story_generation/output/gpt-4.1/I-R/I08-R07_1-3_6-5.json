The conversation quickly turned to Mark, our mutual colleague, and his recent decisions at work. The group\u2019s laughter and sharp comments made me uneasy. As an acquaintance, I felt the unspoken pressure to join in, to nod or add a witty remark, to show I belonged. But I remembered my Buddhist practice\u2014mindfulness, compassion, and the vow to avoid speaking ill of others. My phone buzzed, reminding me that I was leading the weekly meditation session in just half an hour. I should be preparing, centering myself, but here I was, caught between the pull of social acceptance and the call to inner peace. My mind raced: if I excused myself now, would they think I was judging them? If I stayed, could I resist the urge to participate? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt my breath grow shallow, my heart caught between two worlds."}
