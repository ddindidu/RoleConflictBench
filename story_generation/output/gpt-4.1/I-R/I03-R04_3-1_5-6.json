This was the last weekend before Amir left for his new job overseas, and I wanted every moment to count. As his girlfriend, I\u2019d promised we\u2019d spend the whole day together\u2014just us, making memories to hold onto while he was gone. But as I was getting ready, my phone buzzed. It was Layla from the mosque, asking if I had time to talk. She\u2019d sounded casual, but I knew her struggles ran deep, and as the imam, I was expected to be there for her, to offer guidance and comfort whenever needed.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. Amir was waiting, his suitcase already by the door, his eyes searching mine for reassurance that I\u2019d be present, truly present, for our last day together. But Layla\u2019s message weighed on me too\u2014her trust, her vulnerability, the responsibility I carried as her spiritual guide. My heart ached as I tried to balance the love I felt for Amir with the duty I owed my community. The clock ticked, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
