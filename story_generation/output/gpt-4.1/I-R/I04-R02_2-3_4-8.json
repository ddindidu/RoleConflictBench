It was Mark, my oldest friend, his voice tight with panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. I\u2019m almost at the airport\u2014can you check and bring it if it\u2019s there? My flight\u2019s in two hours.\u201d I glanced at the clock. The class was in less than an hour, and the family had stressed how important this final session was for their child\u2019s big day. As a priest, I knew how much this meant to them; I\u2019d promised to be there, to guide and support them. But Mark had always been there for me, and now he needed me in a way only a true friend could answer. My mind raced, torn between the urgent call of friendship and the sacred duty I owed my parishioners. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt my heart pounding as I stared at the lesson plans, Mark\u2019s voice echoing in my mind."}
