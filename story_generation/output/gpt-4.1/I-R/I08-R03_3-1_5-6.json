My heart felt light, knowing I had a few precious hours set aside for spiritual reading and quiet reflection\u2014time I rarely found for myself. I opened my worn prayer book, ready to lose myself in contemplation, when my phone buzzed. It was Anna, an acquaintance from town. Her message was urgent: her car had broken down on a deserted road, and she needed help.\n\nAs a nun, I cherished these moments of solitude, believing they were essential for my spiritual growth. Yet, as an acquaintance, I knew Anna expected me to come to her aid, just as I would hope for help if our roles were reversed. My mind raced with conflicting thoughts\u2014should I honor my commitment to spiritual discipline, or should I set it aside to help someone in need? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, torn between the quiet sanctuary of my faith and the call of friendship echoing through the phone."}
