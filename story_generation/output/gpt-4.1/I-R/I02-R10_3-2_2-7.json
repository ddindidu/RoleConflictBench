She had just lost her uncle, and her pain was raw, spilling through every word. As her boyfriend, I knew she needed me\u2014someone to hold her, to listen, to just be there. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart pounded faster. My family\u2019s annual puja was about to begin, and my parents had reminded me all week how important it was to be present, dressed in traditional clothes, on time. The rituals, the prayers, the sense of belonging\u2014these were not just expectations, but duties I\u2019d grown up with. I wanted to be the partner Priya needed, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my family down or disrespect our traditions. My mind raced, torn between the urge to rush to Priya\u2019s side and the pull of my family\u2019s sacred gathering. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I sat frozen, unable to move, caught between love and duty."}
