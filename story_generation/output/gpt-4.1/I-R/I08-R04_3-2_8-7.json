Earlier that day, as an acquaintance, I had overheard a conversation at the market\u2014something deeply personal about a member of our community. I knew that sharing it, even in passing, could damage their reputation. I reminded myself of the importance of not gossiping, of keeping trust, and of not letting idle words harm another.\n\nBut now, as the imam, I faced a different challenge. A long-time congregant had asked to meet with me privately, his voice strained with worry about his family. I sensed he needed guidance, perhaps even about the very issue I had learned. My role demanded that I offer counsel, to help him find peace and clarity. Yet, I felt the weight of what I knew pressing against my conscience. Should I bring up what I had heard if it might help him, or should I keep it to myself, honoring the trust of silence? The expectations of both roles pulled at me, and I felt the tension growing inside, unsure which path would truly serve the greater good."}
