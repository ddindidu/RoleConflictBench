My mind was focused on the words, the melody, and the responsibility I felt as a member of my Jewish community. Just as I was about to cross the street, I spotted Rachel, someone I know from work, sitting on a bench with tears streaming down her face. She looked up and our eyes met. I could see she needed someone\u2014anyone\u2014to talk to. As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to sit beside her, offer comfort, and be the friendly, supportive person I always try to be. But the clock was ticking, and I knew the service would start soon. Missing my part would let down the congregation and go against my commitment to my faith. I stood there, torn between the urge to help Rachel and the obligation to fulfill my role at synagogue, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
