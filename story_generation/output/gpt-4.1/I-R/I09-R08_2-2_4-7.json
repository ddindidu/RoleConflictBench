But lately, he\u2019s been barking more whenever someone passes our shared door, and Mrs. Patel from next door has started leaving notes about the noise. I feel guilty every time I see her, knowing I should do more to keep the peace. At the same time, my heart is pulled in another direction. I\u2019ve been saving for years to go on Hajj, and this year, my friends are finally going. The money I\u2019ve set aside is just enough, but I know the building is considering soundproofing the hallway, and they\u2019re asking for contributions. If I help, my Hajj savings will take a hit. If I don\u2019t, I risk being the inconsiderate neighbor. The pressure from both sides is suffocating\u2014my faith calls me to fulfill a lifelong dream, but my conscience nags at me to be thoughtful of those living around me. I stand in the hallway, Rumi at my side, torn between two worlds, unsure which path to take."}
