The team meeting was in an hour\u2014the final discussion before we locked in decisions that would shape our project for the next year. My manager had emphasized how crucial everyone\u2019s input was, and I knew my absence would be noticed. But at the same time, the bar mitzvah I was to officiate was set to begin just as the meeting started. The family had been planning this day for months, and the boy had practiced his Torah portion with me every week. They were counting on me to guide him through this milestone, to be present for their community. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My colleagues expected my professional commitment, my presence as a team player. My congregation expected my spiritual leadership, my reliability as their rabbi. I sat at my desk, torn, feeling the impossible pull of two lives that, for this moment, could not coexist."}
