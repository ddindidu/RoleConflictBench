My mentees depended on me to guide them through the final steps, to share the knowledge and experience they needed to succeed. I had promised them a structured session, and I knew how much they were counting on me. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my son\u2019s bar mitzvah was only weeks away, and he still struggled with his Torah portion. As his parent and teacher, I was expected to help him understand the words, the melody, the meaning behind the tradition. My community and family looked to me to pass on our values and history, to ensure he was ready for this milestone. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my mentees\u2019 anxious faces, my son\u2019s uncertain voice. I felt torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my full self to both at once. My heart ached as I tried to decide where I was needed most, wrestling with the fear of letting someone down, no matter what I chose."}
