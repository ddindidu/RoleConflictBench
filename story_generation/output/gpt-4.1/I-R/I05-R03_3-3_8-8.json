As a mentor, I knew how much this project meant to Clara\u2014her first real chance to prove herself, and she was counting on me to guide her through the maze of expectations and deadlines. She had just called, her voice trembling, asking if I could meet with her every evening this week to help her prepare. I wanted to say yes, to be the steady hand she needed.\n\nBut as a nun, my days were already spoken for. The Mother Superior had entrusted me with leading the daily reflections during our retreat, a sacred responsibility that required hours of prayer and preparation. The community would look to me for spiritual nourishment, and I could not let them down. The weight of both roles pressed on my chest\u2014Clara\u2019s anxious hope, the sisters\u2019 quiet trust. I closed my eyes, feeling the tension coil inside me, torn between the call to nurture one soul\u2019s ambition and the call to guide many in faith."}
