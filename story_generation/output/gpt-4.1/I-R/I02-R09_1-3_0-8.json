She tried to brush it off, but I knew her well enough to see through it. As her boyfriend, I wanted to be there, to listen, to hold her hand and let her vent about her day. I was about to ask her to sit with me when my phone buzzed. It was Avi from the synagogue. They needed one more person for the minyan to say Kaddish for someone\u2019s father. Without me, the prayer couldn\u2019t happen. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my community needed me for something sacred, but Rachel needed me too, in a quieter, more personal way. I could see her waiting for me to ask about her day, to show her she mattered. At the same time, I could hear Avi\u2019s voice in my head, the urgency, the tradition, the responsibility. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the pull of faith and the pull of love, not sure which way to turn."}
