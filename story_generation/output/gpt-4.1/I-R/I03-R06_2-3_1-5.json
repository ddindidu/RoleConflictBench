As his girlfriend, I knew he needed me\u2014someone to listen, to comfort, to just be there. He barely looked up when I sat beside him, his eyes rimmed red. My heart ached to stay, to hold his hand and reassure him that he was more than his boss\u2019s words. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was the midweek church service, and I\u2019d promised to help set up for the community dinner afterward. As a Christian, I was expected to be present, to serve, to show my commitment not just in faith but in action. The thought of letting down my church family gnawed at me, but so did the idea of leaving Mark alone in his pain. I felt torn, the two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding a part of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give. My chest tightened as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, caught between the person I loved and the faith I cherished."}
