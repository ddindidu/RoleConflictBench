Maria\u2019s reply was curt, her words edged with hurt. She\u2019d misunderstood my message, and I knew I should call her right away, explain, and clear the air. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate, don\u2019t let wounds fester. But as I reached for my phone, the bell tolled for evening prayers. The Mother Superior\u2019s request echoed in my mind: I was to lead the community\u2019s reflections during the retreat, and I hadn\u2019t finished preparing. My notes were scattered, my thoughts unfocused. I needed this quiet hour for study, for prayer, to be the spiritual guide my sisters expected. Yet Maria\u2019s pain tugged at me, the weight of her friendship pressing on my conscience. I stood in the hallway, torn between the chapel\u2019s soft light and the phone\u2019s insistent glow, feeling the demands of both worlds pulling me apart."}
