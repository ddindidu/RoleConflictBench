My phone buzzed on the coffee table, but I ignored it, savoring the comfort of loose clothes and the absence of any need to dress up. Then another buzz, and another. I finally checked my messages\u2014my team was waiting for my input on a project, and they needed clarification before moving forward. I knew the expectation: as a reliable colleague, I should respond quickly, maybe even hop on a video call if things got complicated. But I glanced down at my outfit\u2014short sleeves, no hijab, definitely not something I\u2019d feel comfortable wearing in front of my male colleagues, even virtually. The thought of changing just to answer a work call felt intrusive, but the guilt of holding up the team pressed on me. I sat there, phone in hand, torn between my commitment to my faith and my responsibility to my colleagues, feeling the weight of both expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
