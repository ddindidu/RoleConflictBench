We\u2019d argued again\u2014this time about money, and the words still stung. As his girlfriend, I knew I should try to resolve things, reach out, and smooth over the tension. That\u2019s what a good partner does, right? But my heart felt heavy, tired from the same fight repeating itself all week.\n\nAt the same time, I\u2019d just heard that Sarah, a friend from church, was struggling. She\u2019d lost her job and was feeling alone. As a Christian, I felt a deep pull to reach out, to show her the love and kindness Jesus taught us. But I only had so much energy, and my mind was tangled in my own relationship problems. I wanted to be there for Sarah, but I also knew my boyfriend expected me to focus on us, to fix what was broken. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which call to make first."}
