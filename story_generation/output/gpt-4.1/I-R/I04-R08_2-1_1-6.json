It\u2019s a pillar of my faith, and lately, I\u2019ve been feeling the weight of not having saved enough to go. The guilt gnaws at me, especially when I see others my age posting photos from Mecca. I was lost in these thoughts when my friend\u2019s name flashed on the screen. I answered, and immediately heard the strain in her voice. She\u2019d had another fight with her partner, and she needed me\u2014really needed me\u2014to listen, to be present, to help her sort through the mess of her feelings. I could hear her trying not to cry. As she spoke, my mind drifted back to my own worries: the pressure to fulfill my religious duty, the fear of letting my community and myself down. I wanted to be there for her, to give her my full attention, but my heart was heavy with my own unmet obligations. I felt torn, pulled between being the friend she needed and the Muslim I aspired to be, unsure which voice to listen to first."}
