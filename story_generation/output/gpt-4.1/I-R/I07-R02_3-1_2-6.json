The team meeting at work was in half an hour\u2014the final discussion before we locked in decisions that would shape our project for months. My manager had emphasized how important it was for everyone to be present and engaged. I knew my colleagues were counting on me to contribute, especially since I\u2019d been part of the core planning group from the start.\n\nBut at the same time, I was supposed to lead the initial planning meeting for our parish\u2019s adult faith formation series. The committee had been waiting for weeks to get started, and as the priest, everyone looked to me for guidance and inspiration. Parents and catechists had already rearranged their schedules to attend.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both communities pressing on my shoulders. If I missed the work meeting, I\u2019d let down my team and risk being seen as unreliable. If I skipped the church meeting, I\u2019d disappoint my parishioners and delay a program that meant so much to them. My mind raced, torn between duty and devotion, as the clock ticked closer to the hour."}
