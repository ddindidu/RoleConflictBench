My friend, Sarah, had just texted, \u201cWhere are we meeting again?\u201d She sounded confused, and I knew from past experience that if I didn\u2019t reply quickly, she\u2019d get anxious and maybe even upset. As her friend, I felt responsible to clear things up right away, to communicate openly and make sure she felt included and reassured.\n\nBut just as I started typing, I noticed Mark sitting alone at the edge of the group.
