My friend\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and I hesitated before answering. His voice trembled, \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now.\u201d I could hear the pain in his words, the kind that only a friend could help soothe. As an imam, though, I was minutes away from delivering the Khutbah\u2014my topic had been announced, and the community was gathering, expecting guidance and inspiration. I felt the weight of their anticipation, the responsibility to lead and not disappoint. Yet, on the other end of the line, my friend needed me\u2014not as an imam, but as someone who would listen without judgment, who would offer comfort. My heart pulled in two directions: the duty to my congregation and the loyalty to my friend. I stared at my sermon notes, my mind racing, torn between the call of friendship and the call to serve."}
