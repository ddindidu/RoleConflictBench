My heart fluttered with both honor and anxiety. The vigil would last several evenings, and I was expected to be present for every prayer, every moment of reflection. Just as I was absorbing this, my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, knocked on my door. She was leaving for a week and, knowing about the planned power outage, asked if I could keep an eye out for her deliveries and make sure her fridge was okay. I nodded, feeling the weight of her trust. Now, as I sit in my small room, I feel torn. The convent expects my unwavering presence and leadership at the vigil, but Mrs. Lee is counting on me for help she can\u2019t get from anyone else. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My mind races, guilt and duty pulling me in opposite directions, and I wonder how I can possibly fulfill both promises."}
