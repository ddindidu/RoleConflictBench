They needed my input on a project detail before they could move forward, and I knew they were waiting for my response. I glanced at the clock\u2014if I didn\u2019t reply soon, the whole schedule would slip. Just as I started typing, the church door creaked open. I looked up to see Maria, her face streaked with tears, clutching her hands together. She barely managed to whisper, \u201cFather, I need to talk. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I could see the desperation in her eyes, the kind that couldn\u2019t wait. My inbox pinged again, the subject line flashing \u201cURGENT: Need Clarification.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my colleagues counting on me to keep things moving, and Maria needing me to be present, to listen, to guide. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my heart torn between the demands of my workplace and the sacred duty I held as a priest."}
