My boyfriend texts, \u201cLet\u2019s pick a night for dinner this week\u2014just us.\u201d I smile, picturing his hopeful face, and scroll through our open evenings. We haven\u2019t had a real date in weeks, and I know he\u2019s craving time together, just to talk and laugh without distractions. But as I start to reply, my mind drifts to the blank page in my notebook labeled \u201cShabbat Sermon Ideas.\u201d The congregation expects thoughtful, inspiring messages, and I need to start brainstorming now if I want to deliver something meaningful in a few weeks. I promised myself I\u2019d set aside time this week to reflect and jot down ideas, but every evening I consider is one I could spend with him. My heart aches with the pressure\u2014how do I choose between nurturing my relationship and fulfilling my calling? I stare at my phone, torn, the weight of both roles pressing in as I try to decide which expectation I\u2019ll have to disappoint."}
