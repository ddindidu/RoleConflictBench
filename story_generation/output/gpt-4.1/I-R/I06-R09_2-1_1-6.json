I scrolled through the assignment, feeling the familiar pressure settle in my chest. As a mentee, I knew how important it was to show commitment, to prove I could handle responsibility. My mentor always said, \u201cConsistency is key,\u201d and I wanted to live up to that.\n\nBut then I glanced at my calendar and saw the reminder for synagogue services. Friday night, as always. My family expected me to be there, and honestly, so did I. It was part of who I was\u2014showing up, being present, joining in the prayers and songs. Even if the minyan would be fine without me, skipping felt like letting something sacred slip away.\n\nI tried to picture myself coding through the evening, the glow of my laptop instead of candlelight. Or maybe rushing through the assignment, distracted by guilt, my mind half in the code and half in the sanctuary. The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure which part of myself I\u2019d have to disappoint."}
