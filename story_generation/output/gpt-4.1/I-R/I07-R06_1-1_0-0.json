As a colleague, I knew I was expected to attend, contribute, and show my commitment to the team. Even though the meeting was just a routine catch-up and would be recorded, I felt the unspoken pressure to be present, to not let my absence be noticed or questioned. But as I reached for my notebook, a message popped up on my phone: a friend from church was in crisis, asking for someone to pray with her right away. My heart twisted. As a Christian, I try to live out my faith daily, to be there for others in need, to put compassion and love into action\u2014not just in big moments, but in the small, inconvenient ones too. I stared at the meeting invite, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me. My mind raced, torn between the loyalty I owed my team and the call to live out my faith in real, tangible ways. I sat frozen, wrestling with what to do next."}
