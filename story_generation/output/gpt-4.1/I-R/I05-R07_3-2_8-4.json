My mentee, Sarah, sits across from me, her eyes wide with anxiety as she describes the challenges of her upcoming project presentation. She\u2019s counting on me to help her navigate this moment, to offer guidance that could shape her career. I want to be fully present for her, to encourage her growth and help her find her confidence. Yet, in less than ten minutes, my Buddhist meditation group will begin their weekly session\u2014a sacred hour I\u2019ve promised myself to attend, a time to cultivate mindfulness and inner peace. The expectation to guide Sarah tugs at me, but so does the commitment to my own spiritual practice. My mind races, torn between the urge to stay and support her and the longing to honor my meditation. I feel the tension coil in my chest, the two roles pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my presence, each reflecting a part of who I am."}
