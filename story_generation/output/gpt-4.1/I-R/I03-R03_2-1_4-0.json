Missed you all week.\u201d My heart aches a little. We\u2019ve barely had time together, and with my travel schedule, tonight is our only chance for days. I want to be there, to laugh and talk and just be his girlfriend, not someone always rushing off. But as I set my phone down, the convent bell rings, reminding me of the food drive. The sisters are counting on me; the shelter needs every pair of hands. I picture the faces of the people we help, the gratitude in their eyes. My habit feels heavier than usual, as if it knows I\u2019m torn. I promised him this evening, but I also promised my community I\u2019d serve. My mind spins with guilt and longing\u2014how can I be both the girlfriend he needs and the nun I vowed to be? The clock ticks, and I stand frozen, caught between love and duty, unable to move toward either door."}
