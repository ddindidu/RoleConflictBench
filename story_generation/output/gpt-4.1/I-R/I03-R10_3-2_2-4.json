He barely spoke, just stared at the floor, lost in grief after his father\u2019s sudden passing. My heart ached for him, and I knew he needed me to be present, to hold his hand, to listen. That was what a good girlfriend would do\u2014be his anchor, his comfort. But my phone buzzed again. It was Priya, desperate for help. She was being blamed for something she didn\u2019t do at work, and I knew it was wrong. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to speak out against injustice, no matter how uncomfortable. My mind raced\u2014if I left Arjun now, would I be abandoning him when he needed me most? But if I stayed, was I turning my back on my values, letting a friend suffer in silence? The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt torn in two, unable to quiet the storm inside."}
