The team meeting is starting in ten minutes, and as a colleague, I\u2019m expected to be there, to contribute, to show I\u2019m engaged. It\u2019s a routine catch-up, nothing urgent, and I know it\u2019ll be recorded, but I also know how much my manager values real-time participation. \n\nBut my stomach rumbles, reminding me I haven\u2019t eaten since early morning. Traveling for work always complicates things, especially when it comes to keeping kosher. I spotted a small vendor nearby, the only one in the area with a kosher certification. If I don\u2019t go now, I\u2019ll miss my chance for a proper meal until much later. \n\nI feel the pressure mounting\u2014my team expects me to be present, but my faith demands I eat only what\u2019s permitted. I stare at my laptop, then at the door, torn between the meeting and the vendor, wrestling with the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
