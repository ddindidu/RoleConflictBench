As a mentor, I\u2019d just finished a check-in with my mentee, Sarah. She was bright, ambitious, but lately, her deadlines slipped and her energy waned. I wanted to help her develop better time management, to encourage her growth, but I could see she was overwhelmed. I made a note to follow up, to offer more support, maybe even rearrange my schedule for her.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was Brother Ahmed, a long-time congregant. His message was brief but urgent\u2014he needed to meet soon, his family was under immense stress. As an imam, I knew my community looked to me for spiritual guidance, especially in times of crisis. I felt the weight of his trust, the expectation that I would be there for him.\n\nBut my calendar was already tight. If I met with Ahmed, I\u2019d have to postpone my session with Sarah, possibly letting her down when she needed me most. If I prioritized Sarah, I risked failing Ahmed in his hour of need. The demands of both roles pressed in, and I felt torn, uncertain which path to take."}
