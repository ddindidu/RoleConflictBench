It was Mark, my oldest friend, his voice shaky and urgent\u2014his car had broken down on the highway, miles from town, and he needed me. My heart lurched. Mark had always been there for me, and I knew he was counting on me now, stranded and scared in the dark. But tonight was the main weekly service, the one I led for the whole congregation. They expected me to be there, to guide them in prayer, to offer comfort and stability. I could already picture the pews filling, the quiet anticipation, the trust they placed in me as their priest. My mind raced, torn between the desperate plea of my friend and the sacred duty to my community. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore. My hands trembled as I stared at the phone, caught between two worlds, unsure which call to answer."}
