As a mentor, I was expected to provide clear, structured guidance to my mentee, who was on the verge of making a career decision that could change everything for her. She needed my full attention, my experience, and my unwavering support. I had spent hours preparing notes, mapping out scenarios, and rehearsing the conversation in my mind.\n\nBut just as I was about to call her, my phone buzzed with a message from a parishioner. He asked if we could schedule a chat\u2014nothing urgent, just a gentle request for spiritual counsel. As a priest, I knew how important it was to be available, to offer comfort and guidance, even for the smallest concerns. The expectation was to be present, to listen, to care.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. Both roles demanded my presence, my empathy, my wisdom. I stared at the phone, wrestling with the knowledge that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
