As a mentor, I was supposed to encourage my mentee, Sarah, who was on the verge of presenting a project that could launch her career. She looked to me for confidence, for the push to take risks and seize her moment. Yet, just as I was about to review her final draft, my phone buzzed. It was Mark, a member of my congregation, asking if I could meet. He was facing a life-altering decision, desperate for spiritual guidance and reassurance that he was not alone in his struggle.\n\nI glanced at Sarah\u2019s anxious face, then at Mark\u2019s message. Both needed me, but in such different ways. Sarah needed my practical wisdom and unwavering support; Mark needed my compassion and spiritual insight. I felt torn, knowing that giving my full attention to one meant letting the other down, at least for now. The expectations of nurturing growth and offering spiritual solace clashed within me, and I sat there, heart pounding, wrestling with which call to answer first."}
