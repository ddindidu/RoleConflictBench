Her smile was there, but it didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. I wanted to pull her into a hug, ask her about her day, and just listen\u2014be the boyfriend she needed, the one who could help her shake off the stress of another long shift. But as I set my bag down, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Carter, a parishioner. She wasn\u2019t in crisis, but she wanted to know if I could find time to talk with her soon\u2014she\u2019d been feeling a bit lost lately, she said.\n\nI felt the familiar tug inside me, the split down the middle. My girlfriend needed me here, present and attentive, but Mrs. Carter was reaching out, and as her priest, I was expected to be available, to offer comfort and guidance. I could see my girlfriend waiting for me to sit beside her, to ask about her day, but I also knew Mrs. Carter might be hoping for a quick reply, some reassurance that I cared.
