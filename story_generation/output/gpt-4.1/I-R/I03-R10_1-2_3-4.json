He\u2019d been hinting at a new restaurant, and I could already imagine us laughing over dinner, just the two of us. But then, today, I saw our friend Priya being blamed for something she didn\u2019t do at work. The injustice stung, and I felt a deep urge to stand by her, to speak up, just as my parents taught me\u2014dharma above all, always do what\u2019s right. But if I get involved, it might take up my evenings, and I know he\u2019s been waiting for this time together. I can almost hear his disappointment if I cancel, and I want to be there for him, to nurture our relationship. Yet, my conscience tugs at me, reminding me of my duty to fairness and truth. My heart aches, caught between being the girlfriend he needs and the person my faith expects me to be."}
