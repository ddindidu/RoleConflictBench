I need your advice before I decide.\u201d She was on the verge of accepting a job offer that could change her life, and she trusted me to help her weigh the risks. I knew I should give her my full attention, listen carefully, and offer the structured guidance she expected from me as her mentor. But as I glanced at the time, I realized it was almost dusk\u2014the sacred hour for my daily puja. Every evening, I light the lamp, offer flowers, and recite prayers at my home altar, a ritual that grounds me and honors my faith. My family expects me to uphold this tradition, and I feel a deep responsibility to maintain it. The phone buzzed again. I felt torn, my mind pulled between the urgent needs of my mentee and the quiet sanctity of my spiritual practice. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which part of myself to honor in this moment."}
