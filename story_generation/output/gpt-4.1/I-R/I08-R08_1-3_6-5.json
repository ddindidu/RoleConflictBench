A group of familiar faces clustered near the entrance, their voices low but animated. As I approached, I caught snippets of their conversation\u2014comments about a mutual colleague\u2019s recent decisions at work, some of them sharp, others laced with laughter. As an acquaintance, I felt the unspoken pressure to join in, to nod or add my own thoughts, but I remembered how much I disliked gossip and how I always tried to avoid speaking negatively about others.\n\nAt the same time, I became acutely aware of my clothing. I had rushed from work, and my shirt was a little shorter than I\u2019d have liked, my sleeves not quite reaching my wrists. As a Muslim, I knew the importance of dressing modestly, especially before entering the prayer hall for Friday worship. I felt exposed, worried about being judged by others inside, and guilty for not meeting the expectations of my faith.\n\nCaught between the group\u2019s expectant glances and the looming entrance to the prayer hall, I hesitated, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
