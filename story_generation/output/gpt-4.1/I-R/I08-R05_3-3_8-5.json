I shouldn\u2019t say, but\u2026\u201d She shared a secret about Rachel\u2019s past, something that could easily tarnish her reputation if it spread. As an acquaintance, I knew I should avoid gossip, keep my lips sealed, and not let this information color my interactions or slip into conversation.\n\nBut later that afternoon, I prepared for my conversion candidate\u2019s final study session. Rachel was the candidate. She was nervous, eager, and about to face the Beit Din. As her rabbi, I was expected to teach her Torah and Jewish law, to guide her with honesty and integrity. The knowledge I now carried pressed on me\u2014should I address it, knowing the Beit Din might ask about her background? Or should I protect her privacy, as I would for any friend?\n\nThe expectations of both roles pulled at me. My mind raced with questions: Was I betraying my duty as a rabbi if I stayed silent? Or would I be betraying Rachel, and my own values as an acquaintance, if I spoke? My heart pounded as I waited for her to arrive, torn between the demands of trust and truth."}
