The team meeting is about to start\u2014just a routine catch-up, but my manager always expects everyone to show up and participate, even if the session is recorded. I know my absence will be noticed, and I don\u2019t want to let my colleagues down or seem disengaged. At the same time, tonight is the weekly Buddhist study circle, and we\u2019re finally discussing a chapter I\u2019ve been waiting for. The group relies on each member\u2019s presence and insight, and I feel a deep responsibility to contribute, not just for myself but for the collective growth. My mind races, torn between the professional expectation to be a reliable teammate and the spiritual commitment to my sangha. I can almost hear the gentle voices of my fellow practitioners, inviting me to reflect, while the ping of my work chat reminds me of my obligations. The weight of these conflicting roles presses on me, and I sit frozen, uncertain which path to honor tonight."}
