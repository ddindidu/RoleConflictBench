The project deadline loomed, and I knew how much they depended on me to guide them through the final hurdles. I\u2019d promised them a structured, focused workshop\u2014one that would give them the tools they needed to succeed. As I rehearsed my opening, my phone buzzed. It was an email from a young couple, asking if I could officiate their wedding next year. They wanted to meet soon, to discuss their hopes and dreams, and to see if I was the right rabbi for them. I felt the weight of their request; being a rabbi meant being present for these sacred moments, offering wisdom and support as they began their life together. But the meeting they wanted conflicted with the session I\u2019d scheduled for my mentees. I could feel the tension rising in my chest\u2014my commitment to my students, my responsibility to the couple, both pulling at me with equal force. I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, torn between two worlds that both needed me, unsure how to honor them both."}
