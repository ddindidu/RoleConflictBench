Any evening you want.\u201d My heart fluttered. We hadn\u2019t had a proper date in weeks, and I missed the easy laughter and warmth of his company. But as I scrolled through my calendar, my chest tightened. Every evening was already marked with reminders\u2014puja at 7, chanting at 8, offerings at 9. My family\u2019s tradition was strict; nothing could be skipped or rushed. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, gentle but firm, reminding me that devotion meant discipline, that the gods watched over every ritual.\n\nArjun\u2019s expectation was simple: just a few hours together, any evening I chose. But my other world demanded unwavering commitment, a sacred routine that left little room for spontaneity. I wanted to be the girlfriend who said yes, who made time, who showed him he mattered. But I was also the daughter who honored her faith, who found peace in the rhythm of prayer. The two parts of me pulled in opposite directions, and I sat there, phone in hand, torn between love and devotion, not knowing which part of myself to disappoint."}
