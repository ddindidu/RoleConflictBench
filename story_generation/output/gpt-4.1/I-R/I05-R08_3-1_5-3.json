The doorbell rang unexpectedly, and I glanced at my phone\u2014one of my mentees was at the door, panicked about a critical project due tomorrow. As a mentor, I knew I had to help; my guidance could mean the difference between success and a costly mistake. But as a Muslim, I was acutely aware that my current attire\u2014loose but not quite modest enough for guests\u2014didn\u2019t meet the standards I hold myself to outside of immediate family. My mentee\u2019s anxious voice filtered through the door, pleading for help. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides: the urge to share my knowledge and support, and the commitment to uphold my faith\u2019s expectations. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, wrestling with which role to honor in that moment."}
