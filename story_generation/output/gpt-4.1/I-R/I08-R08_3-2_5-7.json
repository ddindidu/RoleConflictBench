It was Samir, an old acquaintance, his voice shaky as he explained his car had broken down on a deserted road. He needed help, and quickly\u2014no one else was picking up. I glanced at the envelope on my desk, the one with my Hajj savings, the one I\u2019d guarded for years. Samir hinted he might need a loan to cover repairs and a tow, promising to pay me back soon. As a Muslim, I\u2019d been dreaming of this pilgrimage, and my friends were all set to go this year. But as an acquaintance, I knew the right thing was to help when someone reached out in need. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: the sacred duty I\u2019d waited for, and the immediate call for support from someone who trusted me. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
