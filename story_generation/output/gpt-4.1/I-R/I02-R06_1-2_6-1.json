She was upset because I\u2019d forgotten our dinner plans, and now she wanted to talk it out tonight. As her boyfriend, I knew I should resolve this quickly, reassure her, and make things right. But tonight was also the church\u2019s outreach event, something I\u2019d committed to weeks ago. My pastor had reminded us that our actions should reflect our faith, and I\u2019d promised myself to be more involved, to live out my Christian values by serving others.\n\nMy heart pounded as I weighed my options. If I went to Mia, I\u2019d be the attentive boyfriend she needed, but I\u2019d be letting down my church and, in a way, my commitment to God. If I went to the outreach, I\u2019d be living my faith, but risking Mia feeling neglected or unloved. The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I felt torn, guilty, and anxious. I wanted to do right by both, but it seemed impossible. I sat on the edge of my bed, phone in hand, wrestling with what to do next."}
