His shoulders were tense, and he barely smiled when I tried to lighten the mood. As his girlfriend, I wanted to reach out, maybe squeeze his hand or offer a comforting word, but we were just steps away from the main prayer hall for Friday prayers. I was acutely aware of my hijab, my long sleeves, and the way I kept my gaze lowered, trying to embody the modesty my faith expects of me, especially in this sacred space. \n\nInside, the expectations felt heavier. I knew Amir needed support, but public displays of affection\u2014even a gentle touch\u2014were out of the question here. I felt torn, wanting to be the caring partner he needed, but also determined to honor the guidelines of my faith. My heart ached with the urge to comfort him, but my mind raced with worry about what others might think, or whether I\u2019d be compromising my beliefs. I stood at the threshold, caught between the warmth of my relationship and the quiet dignity of my religion, unsure which part of myself to listen to."}
