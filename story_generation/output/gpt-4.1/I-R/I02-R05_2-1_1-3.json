It was an optional session, but I knew a few regulars would be there, expecting me to guide them through the week\u2019s Torah portion. As I glanced at my notes, I heard the front door open. My partner walked in, eyes red, shoulders slumped. She barely managed a smile before collapsing next to me, her voice trembling as she recounted the harsh feedback she\u2019d received at work. I reached for her hand, feeling the weight of her disappointment. She needed me\u2014needed comfort, reassurance, someone to listen. But the clock ticked closer to class time, and I imagined the small group gathering, waiting for their rabbi to bring meaning to their evening. My heart pulled in two directions: the loving boyfriend who wanted to hold her until she felt whole again, and the rabbi who felt responsible for his community\u2019s learning. I stared at my phone, torn, the expectations of both worlds pressing in, unsure which part of myself to honor tonight."}
