My mind aches for the silence, the gentle rhythm of my breath, the promise of stillness. But the apartment is thick with tension. My girlfriend sits across from me, arms folded, eyes red from another round of arguing about money. I know she expects me to talk, to help us find a way through this mess, to be the boyfriend who doesn\u2019t walk away when things get hard. But my heart pounds with the urge to retreat, to honor my commitment to mindfulness, to not let anger or frustration drive my words. I feel torn, pulled between the need to resolve our conflict and the need to care for my own mind. If I stay, I risk saying something I\u2019ll regret. If I leave, I risk making her feel abandoned. The clock ticks closer to my meditation window, and I sit frozen, wrestling with the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
