We keep circling back to money\u2014how we spend it, how we save it, and how we never seem to agree. As her boyfriend, I know I should be the one to step up, to smooth things over, to find a way for us to talk without it turning into another argument. But today, at work, something else tugs at me. I see a colleague cut in line at the cafeteria, skipping ahead of others who\u2019ve been waiting. It\u2019s a small thing, but as a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, to act with integrity even in the little moments. My mind spins: should I say something, risking awkwardness and maybe even more stress, or let it go? I feel pulled in two directions\u2014wanting to be the calm, steady boyfriend Priya needs, but also the principled person my faith expects. The weight of both roles presses on me, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that whatever I do, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
