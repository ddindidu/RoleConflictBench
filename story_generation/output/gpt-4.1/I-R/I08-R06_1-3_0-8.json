We weren\u2019t close\u2014just acquaintances from work, exchanging polite nods and the occasional small talk. I could see something was off; his eyes were red, and he looked like he hadn\u2019t slept. My mind raced. As an acquaintance, I was expected to keep things light, maybe offer a quick \u201cHey, how\u2019s it going?\u201d and move on, not prying into his personal life. But as a Christian, I felt a deeper pull. Jesus taught us to love our neighbors, to reach out when someone is hurting. I sensed this was one of those moments where compassion mattered, where a simple gesture could mean everything. Yet, I hesitated, torn between not overstepping the boundaries of our casual relationship and the urge to show genuine care. My heart pounded as I approached, wrestling with the fear of making things awkward and the conviction that I should do more than just smile and walk by."}
