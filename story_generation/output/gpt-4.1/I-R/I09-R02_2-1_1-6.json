As a neighbor, I wanted to make a good impression\u2014be friendly, approachable, the kind of person who brings a little sweetness to a first meeting. I\u2019d seen the family next door unloading groceries earlier, and I hoped to catch them before the day got too busy. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. The planning meeting for the adult faith formation series was set to begin in just fifteen minutes, and as the priest, I was expected to lead, to inspire, to be fully present for my parishioners. \n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing in. If I delayed the meeting, I\u2019d let down the team and possibly disrupt the whole season\u2019s schedule. If I skipped the neighborly gesture, I\u2019d miss the perfect moment to build trust and warmth in this new place. My hands trembled slightly as I held the cake, torn between the door and my phone, wrestling with the expectations of kindness and leadership, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully be both at once."}
