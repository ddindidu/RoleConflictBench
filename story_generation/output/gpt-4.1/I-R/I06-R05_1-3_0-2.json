My mentor\u2019s email blinked on my screen, a reminder of the optional reading she\u2019d suggested\u2014an article on spiritual leadership, not urgent, but she\u2019d said it would \u201cdeepen my perspective.\u201d The deadline was weeks away, but I knew she\u2019d ask about it soon. I wanted to impress her, to show I was dedicated.\n\nBut the High Holidays loomed. As rabbi, I was expected to deliver a sermon that would resonate with every soul in the congregation. The pressure was immense; families who rarely attended would be there, waiting for words that would move them, inspire them, maybe even change them. My mind spun with ideas, but none felt right. I needed hours\u2014days\u2014to prepare.\n\nI stared at the article, then at my blank sermon notes. If I focused on the reading, I\u2019d fall behind on the sermon. If I poured myself into the sermon, I\u2019d disappoint my mentor. My stomach twisted as I tried to breathe, caught between the person I wanted to become and the leader I was supposed to be."}
