As a mentor, I had promised to guide Sarah through her final preparations for the interview that could change her life. She had worked so hard, and I knew how much she depended on my support, especially today, the eve of her big opportunity. Yet, as a priest, my congregation awaited me for the most significant religious holiday of the year. The sanctuary would be filled with faces\u2014some seeking comfort, others hope, all expecting me to lead them in prayer and celebration. The phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, her anxiety palpable even through text. At the same time, the church bells echoed, a reminder of my sacred duty. My heart twisted, torn between nurturing one soul\u2019s future and tending to the spiritual needs of many. Both roles demanded my presence, my full attention, and I felt the impossible pull of being needed in two places at once."}
