The client was waiting, and my part of the work was the linchpin\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish by tonight, the whole delivery would be delayed. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the calendar reminder: counseling session with Mrs. Evans in half an hour. She\u2019d reached out after Sunday\u2019s service, her voice trembling, desperate for guidance. As a priest, I knew how much she needed someone to listen, to help her find hope. But as a colleague, I was expected to be reliable, to meet deadlines and keep the team\u2019s trust. My inbox pinged with a message from my manager, checking on my progress. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my congregation\u2019s needs on one side, my team\u2019s expectations on the other.
