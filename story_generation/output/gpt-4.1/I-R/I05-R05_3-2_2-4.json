My mentee, Sarah, waited anxiously for my advice on a job offer that could change her life. She needed me to walk her through the pros and cons, to help her see the path ahead with clarity. I could see the hope in her eyes, the trust she placed in my guidance. But as I glanced at my calendar, my heart tightened. In just ten minutes, I was expected in the synagogue classroom, where a dozen children would be waiting for their weekly Torah lesson. Their parents counted on me to nurture their children\u2019s Jewish identity, to teach them the stories and laws that shaped our people. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014Sarah\u2019s future on one side, the children\u2019s spiritual growth on the other. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to mentor and the sacred duty to teach. I could not be in two places at once, and the expectations from both roles felt impossibly high. My hands trembled as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
