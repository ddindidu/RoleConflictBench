My mentor, who had squeezed me into her schedule just before a long flight, expected me to be ready and focused for our session. She\u2019d made it clear how valuable her time was, and I felt the weight of her generosity. At the same time, the monastery\u2019s annual festival was about to begin. As a practicing Buddhist, I was counted on to help with the dawn preparations\u2014sweeping the courtyard, arranging offerings, and chanting with the community. The monks had asked for committed volunteers, and I\u2019d promised to be there. My mind spun with guilt and anxiety. If I missed the session, I\u2019d disrespect my mentor\u2019s effort. If I skipped the festival, I\u2019d let down my sangha and my own spiritual practice. I sat in the quiet, torn between two worlds, feeling the pressure of expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
