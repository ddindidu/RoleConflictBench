She thought I\u2019d promised to spend Saturday with her, but I\u2019d meant Sunday afternoon, after church. Now she was upset, and I could hear the disappointment in her words. As her boyfriend, I knew I should call her, talk it through, and make things right. That\u2019s what she expected\u2014someone who would resolve misunderstandings, not let them fester.\n\nBut my laptop was open, the blinking cursor waiting for me to finish my sermon for Sunday. The congregation counted on me to guide them, to teach about forgiveness and making wise choices. I\u2019d spent hours searching for the right words, and I was so close to finishing. If I stopped now, I might lose my train of thought, and the message wouldn\u2019t be as strong.\n\nMy heart tugged in two directions. Emily needed me, but so did my church. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. I sat there, phone in one hand, sermon notes in the other, torn and uncertain about what to do next."}
