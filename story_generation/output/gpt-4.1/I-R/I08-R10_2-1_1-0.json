As an acquaintance, I knew I should approach her, offer a smile, and help her feel welcome. That\u2019s what people expected of me: to be warm, open, and attentive. But as I took a step forward, I felt the familiar tug of my other self\u2014the part of me that clung to my Hindu roots. I hadn\u2019t had time for my full morning ritual, so I\u2019d been quietly repeating a short mantra under my breath throughout the day, hoping it would be enough. Now, as I prepared to greet her, I felt the words of the mantra on my lips, the need to finish it before I spoke. I hesitated, torn between the urge to fulfill my social role and the quiet, persistent call of my faith. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between the expectations of being a good acquaintance and honoring my spiritual practice, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
