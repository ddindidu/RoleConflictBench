Upper management will review it.\u201d My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but my mind kept drifting. Tonight was the community Quran study circle, and I hadn\u2019t read the assigned verses. As a Muslim, I was expected to recite and reflect, to show up prepared and engaged. The group counted on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down or miss the spiritual nourishment I always found there.\n\nBut the report was long, and I knew it would take hours to finish. My mentor trusted me, and I didn\u2019t want to risk disappointing her or jeopardizing my progress. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me\u2014my mentor\u2019s expectations for excellence, my community\u2019s hope for my participation and sincerity. I felt torn, my heart heavy with the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. I glanced at the clock, anxiety rising, knowing I had to choose where to give my time and energy tonight."}
