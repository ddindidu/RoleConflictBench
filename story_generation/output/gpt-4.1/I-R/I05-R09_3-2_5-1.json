As a mentor, I was expected to guide my team through a complex project, one where a single misstep could cost us dearly. My phone buzzed with questions, emails piled up, and I knew they were all waiting for my advice, my experience, my steady hand. But as I glanced at the calendar, my heart tightened. Passover was only days away, and my children still hadn\u2019t learned the blessings. As a Jewish parent, it was my duty to teach them, to pass on the traditions and values that shaped me. I could hear their laughter from the next room, a reminder of the promise I\u2019d made to help them prepare. The demands pulled at me from both sides\u2014my team\u2019s anxious faces, my children\u2019s expectant eyes. I felt torn, knowing that whichever role I chose to fulfill tonight, I would be letting someone down. The clock ticked on, and I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
