Just an hour ago, I\u2019d made a careless joke at lunch, and now I\u2019d learned it had cut my friend deeply. I knew I needed to call her, to apologize, to explain myself and listen\u2014because that\u2019s what friends do. We don\u2019t let misunderstandings fester. But as I reached for my phone, the convent\u2019s bell rang urgently. Sister Maria rushed in, breathless, telling me the mayor was on the line. The hurricane had devastated the town, and he was pleading for our help to organize relief for the hundreds suddenly homeless. As a nun, I was expected to put the needs of the suffering first, to lead our sisters in service and charity. My friend\u2019s pain tugged at my heart, but so did the cries of those left with nothing. I stood frozen, torn between the call of compassion for one and the desperate needs of many, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, demanding I choose."}
