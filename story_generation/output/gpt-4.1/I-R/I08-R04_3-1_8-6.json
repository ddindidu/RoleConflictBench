As an imam, people often confided in me, seeking guidance or simply a listening ear. Earlier today, a community member had approached me, mentioning they wanted advice about a personal matter. I promised to make time for them soon. But just before the evening prayer, an old acquaintance pulled me aside, their voice low and urgent. They shared a sensitive piece of information about someone in our community\u2014something that, if repeated, could seriously damage that person\u2019s reputation.\n\nAs an acquaintance, I knew I should avoid gossiping or speaking ill of others. Yet, as an imam, I felt a responsibility to provide spiritual guidance, especially if someone\u2019s well-being or the community\u2019s harmony was at stake. My mind raced with questions: Should I bring up what I\u2019d heard if it might help the person seeking advice? Or would that be betraying a trust and fueling gossip? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I found myself torn, unsure how to honor both expectations without causing harm."}
