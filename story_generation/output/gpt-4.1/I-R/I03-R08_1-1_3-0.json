My phone buzzes with a message from Amir: \u201cLet\u2019s go out tonight? Just us, finally.\u201d I smile, remembering how we\u2019ve both been longing for time together, just to talk and laugh without rushing. As his girlfriend, I want to say yes, to give us that space to reconnect, to be present for him the way he\u2019s been for me.\n\nBut as I set my phone down, my eyes fall on the Quran resting on my desk. I promised myself I\u2019d spend more time reciting and reflecting, especially now that my schedule has eased. My heart aches with the weight of that promise. I know how much peace and grounding I find in those quiet moments with the Quran, how important it is for my faith and my sense of self.\n\nI sit on my bed, torn. Amir\u2019s waiting for my answer, and I want to make him happy. But I also feel the pull of my faith, the need to honor my commitment to spiritual growth. The two parts of me\u2014girlfriend and Muslim\u2014both asking for this evening, and I don\u2019t know which to choose."}
