Just us.\u201d My heart fluttered. We\u2019d barely seen each other all week, and tomorrow he\u2019d be gone for work. Tonight was our only chance. But then I glanced at my calendar and felt my stomach twist. I was scheduled to chant Torah at synagogue tonight\u2014a commitment I\u2019d made months ago. My rabbi had even called to remind me how meaningful it was to the community, especially since I\u2019d been practicing for weeks.\n\nEthan expected a cozy evening, maybe dinner and a movie, just the two of us. But my community expected me to show up, to honor my promise and my faith. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice: \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep your word, especially to your community.\u201d I wanted to be the girlfriend Ethan deserved, present and loving, but I also wanted to be the Jew my family and synagogue could count on. The two parts of me pulled in opposite directions, and I felt the pressure mounting, my chest tight with worry as I tried to figure out what to do."}
