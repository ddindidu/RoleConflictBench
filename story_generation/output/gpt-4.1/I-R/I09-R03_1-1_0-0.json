She smiled warmly, expecting our usual friendly exchange. \u201cGood morning, Sister,\u201d she said, pausing as if hoping for a chat. I felt the weight of my role as her neighbor\u2014always polite, always present, even in brief encounters. But my mind was already at the convent, where the sisters were waiting for me to help organize the food drive. The expectation there was clear: my hands and heart were needed for the community service we\u2019d promised. I could sense Mrs. Patel\u2019s hope for a moment of connection, but I also felt the pressing responsibility to serve those who depended on us today. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the neighborly warmth I owed her, and the urgent charity work that defined my calling as a nun. I stood there, caught between a simple hello and the greater need waiting just beyond the door."}
