It was Mark, an old friend from college. \u201cHey, I\u2019m stuck on Route 12. My car won\u2019t start, and I don\u2019t know who else to call,\u201d he said, his voice edged with worry. As an acquaintance, I knew I should go help him\u2014he\u2019d done the same for me once. I promised I\u2019d see what I could do.\n\nJust then, Mrs. Evans appeared at my door, her eyes red from crying. \u201cPastor, do you have a moment? I really need to talk. I have to make a decision about my marriage, and I don\u2019t know what God wants me to do.\u201d She looked so lost, and I knew how much she depended on my guidance.\n\nI felt torn. Mark was stranded and counting on me, but Mrs. Evans needed spiritual support right now. Both expected me to be there for them, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart pounded as I weighed their needs, feeling the pressure of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
