Just an hour ago, I\u2019d made a careless joke at lunch, and now I\u2019d learned it had really hurt Priya. As her friend, I knew I should call her immediately, apologize, and try to fix things before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate, clear the air, and show they care. But as I reached for my phone, I noticed a coworker quietly slipping ahead in the cafeteria line. It was a small thing, but my upbringing as a Hindu had always emphasized standing up for what\u2019s right, even in little moments. I felt a tug inside\u2014should I speak up about the unfairness, or would that make a scene? My mind raced: if I called Priya now, I\u2019d miss my chance to address the ethical slip; if I confronted the coworker, I\u2019d delay the apology Priya deserved. Both roles demanded something of me, and I felt torn, caught between the urge to be a good friend and the responsibility to uphold my values. My hand hovered, uncertain, as the seconds ticked by."}
