My inbox pinged with a reminder: \u201cToday\u2019s meeting is crucial. Please be present and engaged.\u201d I knew I couldn\u2019t miss it; the project updates would shape our next steps, and my manager expected everyone to contribute. As I gathered my notes, I noticed a new email from Sarah, a colleague who\u2019d been struggling lately. She wrote, \u201cCould you talk for a few minutes? I\u2019m having a rough day.\u201d I remembered my faith\u2019s call to show love and kindness, to be there for others in their need, just as Jesus taught. But the meeting was about to start, and I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart tugged in both directions\u2014toward my responsibility as a team member and my desire to offer comfort as a Christian. I stared at Sarah\u2019s message, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
