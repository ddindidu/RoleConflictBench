Let\u2019s make it special.\u201d My heart ached. I wanted nothing more than to hold her hand, walk by the river, and savor every moment before she flew across the world. But as I was locking up the mosque after Friday prayers, Brother Ahmed approached me, his voice low. \u201cImam, I could really use your advice. Whenever you have a moment this weekend?\u201d His eyes were tired, hopeful. I knew he\u2019d been struggling lately, and as imam, I was expected to be there\u2014always ready to listen, to guide, to help. My mind spun with guilt and anxiety. My girlfriend needed me, craved my presence before her long absence. My community needed me, too, and I\u2019d promised to serve them selflessly. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, unsure how to honor both without letting someone down."}
