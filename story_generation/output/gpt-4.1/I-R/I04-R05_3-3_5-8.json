It was David, my oldest friend, his voice shaky and urgent. His car had broken down on the highway, miles from town, and he needed me\u2014now. I could hear the fear in his voice, the way he tried to sound calm but couldn\u2019t quite manage it. I promised I\u2019d figure something out, my mind already racing.\n\nBut before I could grab my keys, another call came through. This time, it was Miriam from the synagogue. Mrs. Goldstein had just passed away, and her family was distraught. They needed me to come immediately, to help them through the first moments of grief and begin preparations for the funeral. As their rabbi, I knew how much they depended on me in these moments, how much comfort my presence could bring.\n\nStanding in my hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My friend needed me, alone and scared on the highway. My congregants needed me, lost in their sorrow. I could only be in one place, but both needed me now. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which call to answer first."}
