As an acquaintance, I felt the usual pressure to keep things light and not overstep boundaries\u2014after all, we only chat about work and the weather. But as a Christian, I remembered the teachings about loving your neighbor and comforting those in pain. My heart ached to reach out, to offer a prayer or a gentle word, but I hesitated. What if she found it intrusive? What if my attempt at kindness made her uncomfortable or embarrassed? I stood there, torn between the polite distance expected of an acquaintance and the deeper compassion my faith demanded. My mind raced, wrestling with the fear of crossing a line and the conviction that I should be a source of comfort. I took a shaky breath, unsure of what to do next."}
