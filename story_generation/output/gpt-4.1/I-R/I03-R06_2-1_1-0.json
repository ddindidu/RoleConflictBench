He looked so defeated, and my heart ached to comfort him. As his girlfriend, I knew he needed me to be supportive, to listen, and to reassure him that he was still valued and loved. But as he started venting, his words grew bitter, laced with anger and resentment toward his coworkers. He cursed and blamed, his frustration spilling over. \n\nInside, I felt torn. My faith teaches me to be slow to anger, to forgive, and to speak with kindness. I wanted to gently remind him of these values, to encourage him to see things from a different perspective. But I also knew that right now, he needed empathy, not a sermon. If I spoke up, would I seem unsupportive? If I stayed silent, was I betraying my beliefs? The tension twisted in my chest as I tried to decide which part of myself to honor in this moment."}
