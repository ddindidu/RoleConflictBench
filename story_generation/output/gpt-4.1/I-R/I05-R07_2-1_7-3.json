The hush of the afternoon is perfect, and I\u2019ve been looking forward to this pause all day. Just as I settle onto my cushion, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s Maya, my mentee, her message urgent\u2014she\u2019s panicking about her upcoming interview, the one that could change her career. She asks if I have a moment to talk, her anxiety almost palpable through the screen. As a mentor, I know I should be there for her, offer reassurance, help her find her confidence. But as a Buddhist, I promised myself this window of stillness, a commitment to my own mindfulness and well-being. My mind tugs in two directions: the urge to guide and support Maya, and the need to honor my own practice. I sit, phone in hand, heart thumping, caught between the call to serve and the call to be still."}
