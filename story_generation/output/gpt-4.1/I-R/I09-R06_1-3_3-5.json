As a neighbor, I know I should offer her the extra space in my bin\u2014it's the considerate thing to do, sharing our resources and keeping the street tidy. But tomorrow is also the church\u2019s monthly outreach event, and as a Christian, I\u2019m expected to be there early, helping set up and welcoming newcomers. The service and activities are important to me, and I know my absence would be noticed. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in: the neighborly duty to help Mrs. Lee, and the commitment to my church community. My mind races, torn between being present for my faith family and being the kind of neighbor I believe I should be. I stand at my window, watching the evening settle in, wrestling with what to do."}
