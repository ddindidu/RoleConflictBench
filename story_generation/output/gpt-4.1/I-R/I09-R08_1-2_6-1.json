Ramadan is halfway through, and I\u2019m already behind on my daily reading. I promised myself I\u2019d catch up today, to let the words settle in my heart as the sun drifts across the sky. But then, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from my neighbor, Mrs. Lee. She\u2019s at work, worried about a package that\u2019s supposed to arrive soon. She asks if I can keep an eye out and take it in for her, just in case.\n\nI glance at the clock. The delivery window overlaps perfectly with the quiet hour I\u2019d set aside for my Quran recitation. I know how much these packages mean to Mrs. Lee; she\u2019s always been kind, always ready to help me in a pinch. But my own heart aches with the weight of spiritual responsibility, the desire to honor this sacred month and not fall further behind. I feel torn, the expectations of being a good neighbor and a devoted Muslim pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my presence, my time, my care."}
