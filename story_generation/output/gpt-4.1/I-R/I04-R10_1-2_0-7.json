I glanced at the screen and saw a message from Priya: \u201cUgh, today was endless. Can I vent for a bit?\u201d I knew she\u2019d had a rough week, and as her friend, I wanted to be there for her, to listen and offer comfort like I always did. But my mother was already calling from the hallway, reminding me to hurry up and change into my kurta. The ceremony was about to start, and being late would be disrespectful\u2014not just to my family, but to the traditions I\u2019d grown up with. I stared at Priya\u2019s message, feeling the weight of her need for support, while also feeling the pull of my family\u2019s expectations. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be a good friend and a good Hindu at the same time, torn between two worlds that both mattered deeply to me."}
