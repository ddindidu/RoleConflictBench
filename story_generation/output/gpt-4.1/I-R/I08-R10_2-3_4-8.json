She needed help moving boxes to her new apartment this weekend. \u201cCould you spare a few hours?\u201d she wrote, her words polite but hopeful. As an acquaintance, I knew the unspoken rule: when someone reaches out, you offer support, especially when they rarely ask for favors. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, \u201cBe there for people, even if you\u2019re not close.\u201d\n\nBut this weekend was also the festival of Navaratri, one of the most important times for my family and me. We had planned for weeks\u2014traveling to my grandmother\u2019s village, participating in the rituals, making offerings, and joining the community prayers. As a Hindu, I was expected to be present, to honor the traditions, and to show my devotion. My parents would be disappointed if I missed even a part of it, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing on me.\n\nI sat there, torn, feeling the pressure from both sides. My mind raced, trying to find a way to be in two places at once, but I knew I couldn\u2019t. The demands of being a supportive acquaintance and a devoted Hindu clashed inside me, leaving me restless and uncertain about what to do next."}
