My team\u2019s arguments had exploded into something ugly, and our project deadline was slipping through my fingers. As a mentee, I knew I should reach out, be honest about the chaos, and ask for guidance. That\u2019s what my mentor expected\u2014open communication, no matter how uncomfortable. But it was Sunday morning, and my church\u2019s bells were already ringing down the street. I\u2019d promised myself, and God, that I\u2019d be present every week, not just in body but in spirit, worshipping and serving with my community. Missing service felt like letting down my faith, my friends, and the commitments I\u2019d made as a Christian. My heart pounded as I weighed the phone in my hand, torn between the urgent need to be a responsible mentee and the deep pull to honor my faith. The minutes ticked by, and I felt the pressure mounting from both sides, each expectation heavy and impossible to ignore."}
