First, a message from my friend, Jamie, their words clipped and cold: \u201cDidn\u2019t expect that from you.\u201d My heart dropped. I scrolled up, rereading my earlier text\u2014meant as a joke, but I could see how it sounded harsh. I knew Jamie, and I knew how much they valued honesty and directness. As their friend, I owed them a call, a real conversation to clear the air before the misunderstanding grew.\n\nBut then, another alert: a group chat from the church board. There\u2019d been a fire in the neighborhood\u2014families displaced, people scared and needing comfort. As pastor, I was expected to organize support, to be present, to lead. My phone kept vibrating with updates and pleas for help. I could almost hear the silent expectation: \u201cWe need you now.\u201d\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. Jamie needed me as a friend, right now, to heal a wound I\u2019d accidentally caused. My community needed me as a pastor, right now, to help them through a crisis. My chest tightened as I weighed the demands, feeling the pull of both roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
