Mrs. Patel, my neighbor, was moving her son\u2019s bicycle and a stack of boxes, clearly anxious about the HOA inspection scheduled for noon. She caught my eye and pleaded, \u201cCould you help me move these? I can\u2019t do it alone, and if they cite us, we\u2019ll all get fined.\u201d As a neighbor, I know I should help\u2014shared spaces are everyone\u2019s responsibility, and I\u2019ve always prided myself on being considerate.\n\nBut today is not just any Friday. Our mosque is marking its fiftieth anniversary, and people have come from neighboring towns to hear my sermon. The community expects me to be present, prepared, and focused, especially today.

I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my neighbor\u2019s anxious eyes, the trust of my congregation, and my own sense of duty to each. My heart pounds as I wrestle with what to do next, caught between the corridor and the pulpit."}
