It was Mark, an old acquaintance from college, asking if I could recommend a good restaurant nearby. He was in town for just one night and hoped I could help him out. As an acquaintance, I felt the familiar tug of obligation\u2014I should respond quickly, maybe even offer to meet him if he wanted company. But as a Buddhist, I had promised myself to be present for the meditation, to honor the commitment I made to my practice and the group. My mind raced, torn between the urge to help and the need to be mindful. I could feel the tension in my chest, the pressure of wanting to be supportive and the pull of my own spiritual discipline. The minutes ticked by as I stared at my phone, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I should honor."}
