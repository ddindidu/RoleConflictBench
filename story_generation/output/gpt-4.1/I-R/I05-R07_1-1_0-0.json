My phone buzzed\u2014a message from Maya, one of my mentees, asking if I had a moment to talk about a job offer she\u2019d just received. She sounded anxious, and I knew she valued my guidance, even on these smaller career decisions. I glanced at the clock. The evening chant at the temple would begin in twenty minutes, and as a practicing Buddhist, I was expected to be there, joining the community in ritual and reflection. The thought of missing the chant tugged at me; it was a time for stillness, a way to honor my commitment to the sangha. Yet, Maya\u2019s uncertainty echoed in my mind, and I felt the weight of her trust. I stared at the phone, torn between the quiet sanctuary of the temple and the responsibility I felt toward Maya. My heart raced as I tried to reconcile the gentle pull of my spiritual practice with the immediate need of someone who looked to me for support."}
