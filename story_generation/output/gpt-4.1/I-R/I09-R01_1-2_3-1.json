Trash pickup is tomorrow, and both our bins are only half-full. I know she\u2019s been having trouble with her back, and I could easily offer to combine our trash, saving her the effort. But last month, she mentioned how much she values keeping our boundaries clear, even with something as small as trash bins. I hesitate, not wanting to overstep.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from Mark, a member of my congregation. He\u2019s facing a major life decision and needs to talk tonight. As his pastor, I know he expects me to be present, to listen deeply, and to offer spiritual guidance. I feel the weight of his trust in me.\n\nStanding there, trash bag in hand, I\u2019m pulled in two directions. As a neighbor, I want to be considerate and respect Mrs. Lee\u2019s boundaries. As a pastor, I need to be available and attentive to Mark\u2019s needs. The expectations press in on me, and I find myself frozen, unsure which role to honor first."}
