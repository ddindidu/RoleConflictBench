He was excited\u2014his family was visiting, and he wanted to treat them to the best restaurant in town. \u201cYou know the area so well,\u201d he wrote, \u201ccan you recommend a place? Maybe even join us?\u201d I felt the familiar tug of wanting to be helpful, to be the person people could rely on. That\u2019s what friends and acquaintances do, right? But as I started typing suggestions, my mind drifted to my savings account. Every extra bit I had was carefully set aside for Hajj. This year, my friends were finally going, and I had promised myself I would join them. The thought of spending even a little on a fancy dinner made my stomach twist with guilt. I wanted to support Amir, to be generous and present, but I also felt the weight of my religious commitment, the years of anticipation and planning. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, caught between the warmth of friendship and the pull of faith, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
