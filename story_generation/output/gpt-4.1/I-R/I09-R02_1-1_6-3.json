My neighbor, Mrs. Kim, had mentioned she was expecting a package too, and she often missed them because of her long shifts. She\u2019d asked if I could keep an eye out and receive it for her if it arrived. I agreed, knowing how much she relied on these small favors between neighbors. Just as I was settling in, my phone buzzed\u2014a parishioner, Mark, was reaching out. He didn\u2019t sound urgent, but he asked if I might have time to talk, maybe even today, about something weighing on his heart. As a priest, I knew how important it was to be available, to offer comfort and guidance when someone reached out, even if it was just a tentative request. I felt the pull from both sides: the simple, neighborly act of helping Mrs. Kim, and the deeper, spiritual responsibility to Mark. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, uncertain which need I should answer first."}
