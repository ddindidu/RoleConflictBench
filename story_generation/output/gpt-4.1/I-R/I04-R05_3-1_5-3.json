It was David, my oldest friend, his voice shaky and urgent\u2014his car had broken down on the highway, miles from town, and he needed me to come get him. I glanced at the clock. The class was in less than an hour. It wasn\u2019t mandatory, but I knew several people were looking forward to it; some had even emailed me questions in advance. As their rabbi, I felt a responsibility to be there, to teach, to show up as a steady presence. But David was alone, scared, and I was the only one he trusted to call. My mind raced with the weight of both roles\u2014my friend needed me, but so did my community. I could feel the tension tightening in my chest, torn between the pull of loyalty and the call of duty, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
