I glanced at Mrs. Lee\u2019s door across the hall\u2014she\u2019s lived alone since her husband passed, and I know she gets anxious during storms. As her neighbor, I feel responsible to check in, maybe offer to bring her some candles or just sit with her for a while. But just as I reached for my coat, my phone buzzed again. It was a message from the church secretary: \u201cTom\u2019s been having a rough week. He could use a visit tonight.\u201d As a pastor, I\u2019m expected to be there for my congregation, especially when someone is struggling. I could picture Tom sitting alone, waiting for someone to remind him he\u2019s not forgotten. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014Mrs. Lee\u2019s vulnerability in the storm, Tom\u2019s quiet sadness. Both needed me, both expected me to show up. I stood in the hallway, coat in hand, torn between the neighborly duty just a few steps away and the pastoral care that might mean driving across town in the rain."}
