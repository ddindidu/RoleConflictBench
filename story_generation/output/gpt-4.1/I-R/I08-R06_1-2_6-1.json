A few coworkers were dissecting the recent decisions of our mutual colleague, Mark. As an acquaintance, I knew the unspoken rule: don\u2019t gossip, don\u2019t speak ill of others, especially when they\u2019re not present to defend themselves. But the group\u2019s laughter and knowing glances pulled me in, and I felt the pressure to join, to belong. At the same time, my Christian values echoed in my mind\u2014reminders to speak kindly, to avoid judgment, to treat others as I would want to be treated. The tension tightened in my chest. If I stayed silent, would I seem aloof or judgmental? If I joined in, even just to nod or laugh, would I betray my beliefs? My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations of friendship and faith, feeling the strain of being pulled in two directions, unsure which voice to follow."}
