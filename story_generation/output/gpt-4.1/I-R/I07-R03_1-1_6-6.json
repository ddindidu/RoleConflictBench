The afternoon stretched ahead, promising rare, uninterrupted hours for reflection. I closed my eyes, breathing in the silence, ready to lose myself in prayer. Then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a colleague at work. \u201cNo action needed, just FYI,\u201d it read, but I knew the unspoken rule: respond soon, show you\u2019re engaged, be a good teammate. I stared at the screen, thumb hovering. If I replied now, I\u2019d be pulled from the peace I so desperately craved, my mind shifting to work mode. But if I waited, guilt would gnaw at me\u2014was I letting my colleagues down, appearing aloof or unresponsive? The expectations pressed in from both sides: the world\u2019s demand for constant connection, and my own longing for sacred quiet. My heart wrestled between duty and devotion, the phone\u2019s glow a silent challenge to the stillness I sought."}
