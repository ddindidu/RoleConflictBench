It was Mark, my oldest friend, his voice tight with panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. Can you check and bring it to the airport? My flight\u2019s in two hours.\u201d I could hear the desperation in his voice, and I knew how much this trip meant to him. As a friend, I wanted to drop everything and help.\n\nBut just as I grabbed my keys, another message popped up\u2014a community member, Mrs. Lee, was having a rough day. She\u2019d lost her husband last year, and I\u2019d promised to check in regularly. She wrote, \u201cCould use a kind word today, Pastor.\u201d I could picture her sitting alone, waiting for someone to care.\n\nI stood in my hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds. My friend needed me urgently, but so did Mrs. Lee, in a quieter, aching way. I felt torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role to answer first."}
