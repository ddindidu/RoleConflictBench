We\u2019d argued three times this week about money\u2014how much to save, what to spend, and whether we were even on the same page. As his girlfriend, I knew I should call him, try to resolve things, listen to his worries, and reassure him that we could work through this. But the clock ticked closer to the workshop I was leading for community leaders. As their pastor, I was expected to guide them through difficult theological concepts, to be calm, wise, and focused. My notes were spread out in front of me, but my mind kept drifting to Mark\u2019s hurt voice on the phone last night. I felt torn\u2014my heart heavy with the need to fix things with him, my mind racing with the responsibility to teach and inspire others. Both roles demanded my full attention, but I only had one self to give. I stared at my phone, then at my notes, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
