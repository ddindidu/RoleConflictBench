As an imam, I was used to people coming to me with their burdens, seeking comfort and guidance. Tonight, a young man entered, his eyes red and voice trembling. He needed counsel, desperate for words to help him through his grief. I listened, heart aching for him, but my mind kept circling back to what I\u2019d learned earlier that day\u2014something deeply personal about another member of our community. As an acquaintance, I knew I should never gossip or let slip anything that could harm someone\u2019s reputation. Yet, as an imam, I was expected to offer honest, compassionate guidance, sometimes drawing on what I knew to help others heal or understand. The young man\u2019s pain was raw, and I sensed that sharing the information might offer him some comfort or clarity. But the thought of betraying a trust, even unintentionally, made my chest tighten. I sat there, torn between my duty to protect someone\u2019s dignity and my calling to provide the support this grieving soul so desperately needed."}
