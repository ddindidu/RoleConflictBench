She\u2019d just gotten off the phone with her boss, and the feedback had been harsher than she expected. I wanted to hold her, to tell her everything would be okay, to take her out for ice cream or just sit in silence until she felt better. That\u2019s what she needed from me\u2014her boyfriend, her support.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting. My parents had called earlier, reminding me that this year would be the perfect time to perform Hajj. They said it was my duty as a Muslim, that I should start making arrangements now. But I\u2019d only just started my job, and my savings were barely enough for rent, let alone a pilgrimage. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing down on me, the guilt of not fulfilling a pillar of my faith.\n\nAisha\u2019s hand reached for mine, and I squeezed it, but my thoughts were tangled. I wanted to be present for her, but the pressure of my religious obligation gnawed at me. I didn\u2019t know how to be both the boyfriend she needed and the Muslim I was supposed to be."}
