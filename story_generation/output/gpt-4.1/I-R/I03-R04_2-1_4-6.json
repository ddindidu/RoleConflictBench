He\u2019s already texted me about the movie he wants to watch and the new place he wants to try for dinner. I promised him we\u2019d have this time together, just us, no distractions. But as I was leaving the mosque this afternoon, Sister Amina caught me at the door. She smiled, but her eyes looked tired. \u201cImam, if you have any free time tonight, could I talk to you? I really need some guidance.\u201d I could hear the hope in her voice, and I know how much she\u2019s been struggling lately. As I walk home, my phone buzzes with a sweet message from my boyfriend, and I feel a knot tighten in my stomach. Both of them are counting on me, in different ways. I want to be there for him, to nurture our relationship, but I also feel the weight of my responsibility to my community. The expectations pull at me from both sides, and I can\u2019t see how to meet them both."}
