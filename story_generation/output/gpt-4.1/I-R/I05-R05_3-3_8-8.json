The project she was leading would launch in two days, and she needed my guidance more than ever. As her mentor, I felt the weight of her trust\u2014she counted on me to help her grow, to be present, to offer wisdom and encouragement at this pivotal moment in her career. I promised I\u2019d be there for her, to review her presentation and help her rehearse.\n\nJust as I hung up, my phone buzzed again. It was the synagogue president. A beloved congregant had passed away unexpectedly, and the family was devastated. They needed me to officiate the funeral, and the only time the family could gather was the same afternoon as my mentee\u2019s final rehearsal. As their rabbi, I was expected to comfort, to lead, to honor the deceased and support the grieving. My heart pounded as I stared at my calendar, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds\u2014each demanding my presence, each deserving my full devotion. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the knowledge that no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
