It was David, my oldest friend, his voice tight with panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. I\u2019m almost at the airport\u2014can you check and bring it if it\u2019s there? My flight\u2019s in two hours.\u201d I could hear the desperation in his voice, and I knew how much this trip meant to him. As his friend, I wanted nothing more than to help, to be the person he could count on in a crisis.\n\nBut just as I hung up, my phone rang again. It was Miriam, a congregant\u2019s daughter, her voice trembling. \u201cRabbi, my father just passed. We need you to lead the funeral as soon as possible. The family is gathering now.\u201d I felt the weight of her grief, the expectation that I would be there to guide them through this sacred moment.\n\nI stood in my study, torn between two worlds\u2014one demanding my presence as a friend, the other as a rabbi. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be both."}
