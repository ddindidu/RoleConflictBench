He\u2019d been missing deadlines, and I could see the weight of his responsibilities pressing down on him. As his mentor, I wanted to help him find balance, to encourage him to prioritize and grow. I was about to suggest some strategies when my phone buzzed. It was a message from the synagogue: a beloved congregant had passed away, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral as soon as possible. My heart clenched. As their rabbi, I knew how much my presence and words would mean to them in this moment of grief. But Daniel was looking at me, waiting for guidance, and I could see how much he needed me right now. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me\u2014one demanding my immediate presence for a sacred ritual, the other needing my steady support for personal growth. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities heavy on my shoulders, unsure which call to answer first."}
