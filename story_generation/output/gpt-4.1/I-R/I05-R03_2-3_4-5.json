My mentees depended on me to guide them, to share the skills they needed to succeed. I had promised them a structured session, and I could see their anxious faces in my mind, waiting for clarity and direction. Yet, as I organized my notes, the convent\u2019s bell tolled, a reminder of my other calling. Today, I was not just a mentor\u2014I was also a nun, chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the city\u2019s cathedral, a rare honor and a duty to my sisters and faith. The Mother Superior\u2019s words echoed in my heart: \u201cYou will represent us all.\u201d I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, the needs of my mentees and the sacred responsibility to my community. My hands trembled as I tried to focus, torn between the secular and the spiritual, between nurturing minds and uplifting souls. The minutes slipped away, and I found myself paralyzed, caught in the silent storm of conflicting loyalties, unsure which path to follow."}
