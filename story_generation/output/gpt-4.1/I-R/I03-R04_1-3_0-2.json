Can we talk?\u201d My heart aches for him. As his girlfriend, I want to be there, to listen, to reassure him that he\u2019s not alone. I imagine us sitting together, my hand in his, letting him vent about his boss and deadlines. But as I reach for my coat, my phone buzzes again\u2014this time, it\u2019s the mosque committee. The regular imam is ill, and tonight\u2019s remembrance gathering is larger than usual. They need me to lead the prayers; no one else is authorized. I feel the weight of the community\u2019s expectation pressing on my shoulders. My mind races: Amir needs me, but so does my congregation. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart pulls in one direction, my duty in another. I stand frozen in my hallway, torn between comforting the person I love and fulfilling my responsibility to my faith and community."}
