She\u2019d squeezed me in just before her flight, and I knew how precious her time was. I rehearsed my questions, determined to make every minute count, not wanting to waste a second of her generosity. Just as the call connected, my phone buzzed with a message: \u201cPastor, are you free? I\u2019m really struggling today.\u201d It was from Sarah, a gentle soul in my congregation who rarely reached out. I felt a pang of guilt. As a pastor, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort, especially when someone was reaching out in pain. But as a mentee, I owed my mentor my full attention, especially now. My heart raced as I glanced between the glowing screens, torn between the urgent needs of my community and the rare opportunity to learn from my mentor. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my presence, each deserving it."}
