As a colleague, I knew I should respond to the email that had just arrived\u2014my coworker had sent an update on our project, noting there was no immediate action required, but I still felt the tug of professional courtesy urging me to reply promptly. At the same time, my habit and the rosary at my side reminded me of my deeper calling. As a nun, I had set aside this hour for spiritual study and reflection, a sacred time I tried never to compromise. Yet, just as I opened my prayer book, my phone buzzed again\u2014a parishioner, desperate and lost, asking if I could meet to help her through a crisis of faith. The weight of both worlds pressed on me: the expectation to be a reliable colleague, always present and responsive, and the sacred duty to offer spiritual guidance and compassion. My heart ached as I stared at the screen, torn between the demands of my workplace and the needs of my spiritual community, unsure which path to choose in this moment."}
