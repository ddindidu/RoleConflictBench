It was nearly eight, the hour when Sister Maria opened her office for mentees. She had emphasized the importance of punctuality, reminding us that her time was precious and her schedule tight. I wanted to show her I respected her guidance, to be the kind of mentee who valued every minute she offered. But as I stepped into the hallway, the chapel bell began to toll, its sound echoing through the stone corridors. Morning prayer was about to begin\u2014a sacred duty, a cornerstone of my life as a nun. The other sisters were already filing into the chapel, their heads bowed, their presence a silent reminder of the commitment we all shared. I stood frozen, torn between the pull of my spiritual vows and the responsibility I felt toward my mentor. My hands trembled as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing second."}
