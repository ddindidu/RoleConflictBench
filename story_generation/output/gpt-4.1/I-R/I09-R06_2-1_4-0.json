I winced, knowing how much she values peace and quiet. As a neighbor, I\u2019m expected to keep shared spaces calm and respect everyone\u2019s comfort, but my dog\u2019s anxiety makes that difficult. I\u2019ve tried training, but he still reacts to every sound. \n\nAt the same time, my faith reminds me to be patient, compassionate, and forgiving\u2014not just with others, but with myself. I want to show kindness, to be the sort of Christian who brings peace, not frustration, into the world. But when Mrs. Lee glares at me in the elevator, I feel torn. Should I apologize again, or is it time to consider stricter measures for my dog? I wrestle with guilt and frustration, caught between being a good neighbor and living out my Christian values. The tension knots in my chest as I hear another bark, and I know I have to make a choice soon."}
