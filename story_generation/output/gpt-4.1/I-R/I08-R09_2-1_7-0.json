Total mess. I don\u2019t know how he keeps his job.\u201d I felt a familiar discomfort rise in my chest. As an acquaintance, I try to avoid gossiping or speaking negatively about others, but Rachel\u2019s expectant eyes lingered on me, waiting for a response. I wanted to change the subject, but I also didn\u2019t want to seem unfriendly or judgmental.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the weekly study slot I set aside to teach my kids about Jewish traditions and values. I could shift the lesson to later, but I knew how important it was to model integrity and kindness\u2014values deeply rooted in our heritage. I thought about how I would explain lashon hara, the prohibition against speaking ill of others, to my children. Yet here I was, caught between the pressure to fit in with colleagues and the responsibility to live and teach my values. My heart pounded as I weighed my next words, feeling the tension between who I was expected to be in each role."}
