The deadline was in three days, and I knew how much my mentor valued diligence and commitment. As a mentee, I wanted to prove myself, to show that I could be trusted with responsibility. But my phone buzzed with messages from my friend, who was being treated unfairly by a group in our community. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act with compassion and justice, even if it meant personal inconvenience. My heart ached as I read my friend\u2019s words, feeling the weight of my duty to intervene. Yet, the thought of disappointing my mentor gnawed at me. I felt torn, pulled between the expectations of being a good mentee and the moral imperative of my faith. The hours ticked by, my mind wrestling with the choice\u2014should I focus on the assignment, or should I step in and support my friend? The conflict churned inside me, leaving me restless and uncertain."}
