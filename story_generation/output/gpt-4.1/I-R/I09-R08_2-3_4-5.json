My dog, Max, was with me\u2014he always gets anxious when I leave, and today I had no one to watch him. As I tried to calm him, he started barking loudly at a neighbor passing by, his voice echoing off the walls. I saw the neighbor\u2019s annoyed glance, and guilt pricked at me; I knew I was expected to keep shared spaces peaceful and respect everyone\u2019s comfort. At the same time, I was acutely aware of my own appearance. In my rush to quiet Max, I\u2019d thrown on a long coat, but I worried it wasn\u2019t modest enough for the prayer hall. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my responsibility as a considerate neighbor, and my duty as a Muslim to dress appropriately for worship. My heart pounded as I stood at the threshold, torn between soothing my dog, respecting my neighbor, and fulfilling my religious obligations."}
