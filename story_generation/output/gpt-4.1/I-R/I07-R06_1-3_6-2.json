He\u2019d written, \u201cNo action needed, just FYI,\u201d but I knew he expected a timely acknowledgment. I was about to reply when my phone buzzed with a text from a close friend. She was in trouble, caught in a situation that challenged everything I believed as a Christian\u2014she needed advice, support, and prayer. My heart pounded. I felt the weight of my colleague\u2019s expectation to be responsive and professional, not to leave him hanging. At the same time, I felt the deeper pull of my faith, the call to be present for someone in need, to live out the compassion and integrity I profess. I stared at my screens, torn between the world\u2019s demands and the quiet voice inside urging me to act according to my beliefs. The seconds ticked by, and I wrestled with what to do first, feeling the tension rise between my roles as a reliable colleague and a faithful Christian."}
