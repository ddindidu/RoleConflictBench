The power\u2019s going out this week, and I\u2019m worried about my fridge, too.\u201d I assured her I\u2019d help, as any good neighbor would. But as soon as she left, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She sounded desperate, asking if I could meet her tonight. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and I knew she needed more than a quick prayer. I felt the weight of both requests. If I stayed home to watch over Mrs. Kim\u2019s apartment, I\u2019d miss the chance to be there for Sarah. But if I left, I\u2019d be letting down a neighbor who trusted me. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I found myself standing in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the roles I was supposed to fill."}
