The group\u2019s tone shifted, and soon, subtle criticisms and jokes about Farhan\u2019s motives filled the air. As an acquaintance, I felt the unspoken pressure to join in, to laugh or add my own opinion, just to fit in and not seem aloof. But as a Muslim, I knew gossiping\u2014backbiting\u2014was something I should avoid, no matter how harmless it seemed.\n\nThen, the topic changed. Someone mentioned saving up for vacations, and another joked about how I must be saving for Hajj. The laughter was light, but I felt a pang. I hadn\u2019t saved enough yet, and the expectation to perform Hajj weighed on me. I wanted to explain, to defend myself, but I worried it would only draw more attention or pity.\n\nCaught between wanting to be accepted by my peers and staying true to my faith, I felt my chest tighten. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I sat there, unsure of what to say or do next."}
