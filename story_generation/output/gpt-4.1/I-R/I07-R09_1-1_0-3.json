As a colleague, I was expected to join, contribute, and show my engagement, even though the meeting would be recorded for anyone who missed it. I knew my manager valued visible participation, and I didn\u2019t want to seem disengaged. But as I reached for a snack before the meeting, I noticed the only available option on the table was a box of pastries someone had brought in to celebrate a project milestone. They weren\u2019t labeled, and I couldn\u2019t be sure if they were kosher. My colleagues were already gathering, chatting and helping themselves, expecting everyone to join in the small celebration. I felt the pressure to be part of the group, to share in the moment, but I also felt the weight of my commitment to keeping kosher, especially when alternatives were usually available but not this time. My stomach tightened as I stood at the threshold, torn between my desire to belong and my need to honor my faith, unsure which expectation I could afford to disappoint."}
