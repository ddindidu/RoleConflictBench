It was Daniel, one of the young adults I mentor at the community center. He sounded anxious, asking if I could meet him soon\u2014he was torn between two job offers and needed advice. I promised I\u2019d find time, as I always do, even if it\u2019s just a quick chat over coffee. Moments later, Mrs. Alvarez called, her voice trembling with urgency. Her daughter\u2019s sacrament was this weekend, and the family needed me to organize a final, mandatory preparation session tonight. I could hear the expectation in her tone; this was a milestone for their faith, and my presence was essential. My mind raced, torn between Daniel\u2019s need for guidance and the sacred responsibility to the Alvarez family. Both roles demanded my attention, both were important, and both expected me to be fully present. I felt the weight of their trust pressing on me, my heart caught between the gentle pull of mentorship and the solemn call of priesthood, unsure which path to take first."}
