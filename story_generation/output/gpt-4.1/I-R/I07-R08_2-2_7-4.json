They\u2019re waiting for my input before they can move forward with the project, and I know the expectation: quick, clear communication. I type a response, but my mind is already drifting to the office function this afternoon. It\u2019s a big event, and everyone is expected to attend. I want to be part of the team, to show I\u2019m committed and approachable. But I also know the unspoken pressure to blend in, to dress in a way that matches the office\u2019s semi-formal, sometimes flashy style.\n\nAs a Muslim, I\u2019m committed to dressing modestly\u2014long sleeves, loose clothing, a hijab. I worry about standing out, about the curious glances or awkward questions. I want to be seen as a team player, not as someone distant or different. My inbox pings again, and I feel the weight of both roles pressing in: the reliable colleague, the faithful Muslim. I sit at my desk, torn between the expectations of my team and the values I hold close, unsure how to move forward."}
