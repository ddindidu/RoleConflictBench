Can you talk?\u201d I know he\u2019s been struggling lately, and as his friend, I want to be there\u2014just listen, let him vent, maybe make him laugh. But as I start to type a reply, my calendar reminder pops up: the Johnsons\u2019 final sacrament prep session is in thirty minutes. They\u2019ve stressed how important this is, how much they\u2019re counting on me to guide their child through this milestone. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. Mark needs me now, not later, and I know how much it means to him when I\u2019m present. But the Johnsons are expecting me to be prepared, focused, and spiritually supportive for their family. My mind races, torn between the comfort I want to give my friend and the responsibility I owe as a priest. I stare at my phone, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both matter deeply to me."}
