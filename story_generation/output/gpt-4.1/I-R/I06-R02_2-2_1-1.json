The logic was tricky, and I knew I\u2019d need hours to get it right before our next meeting. My mentor expected nothing less than a polished solution, and I didn\u2019t want to disappoint. But as I typed, the church bell echoed through the evening air\u2014a reminder that tonight was the main weekly service. As the priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, offer guidance, and be present for my community. They relied on me for comfort and spiritual support, especially during these gatherings. My mind raced between the lines of code and the verses of scripture I was supposed to recite. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention. If I focused on the code, I\u2019d neglect my congregation. If I led the service, I\u2019d risk falling short as a mentee. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between two callings, unsure which to answer first."}
