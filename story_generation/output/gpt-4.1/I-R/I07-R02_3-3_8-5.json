I started typing a response, fingers poised over the keyboard, when the church door creaked open. A woman entered, her face streaked with tears, her hands trembling. She barely managed to whisper, \u201cFather, I need help. Please, it\u2019s urgent.\u201d \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My colleagues expected reliability, quick communication, and professionalism. But as a priest, I was called to be present, to offer comfort and guidance in moments of crisis. The woman\u2019s pain was raw and immediate, demanding my full attention. My mind raced\u2014if I paused to help her, I\u2019d risk letting down my team; if I finished the email first, I\u2019d be turning away someone in desperate need. My heart pounded as I stood between the glowing screen and the broken soul before me, torn by the impossible demands of both roles."}
