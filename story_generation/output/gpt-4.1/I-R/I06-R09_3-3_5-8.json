I knew I should reach out, explain the mess, ask for guidance. That\u2019s what a good mentee does: communicate, be honest, don\u2019t let things fester.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed again. It was David from the synagogue. \u201cWe need one more for the minyan. Can you come? It\u2019s for a funeral prayer.\u201d I looked at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the window to call my mentor before his next meeting. But if I didn\u2019t go, the mourners would be left waiting, unable to say Kaddish for their loved one. My heart pounded. My community needed me, but so did my project\u2014and my mentor\u2019s trust. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
