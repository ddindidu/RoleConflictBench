I glanced at the clock\u20142:13 a.m. My heart sank when I saw it was Maya. Her voice trembled, thick with tears, as she told me her father had just passed away. I sat up, instantly alert, listening to her sobs, feeling her pain as if it were my own. She needed me to be present, to listen, to hold her together when she was falling apart.\n\nBut in just a few hours, I was supposed to lead the weekly meditation at the temple. As the group leader, everyone expected me to be calm, centered, and fully present, guiding them through mindfulness with a clear mind. I knew how much the group relied on this hour, how much I valued my own practice. Yet, as Maya\u2019s voice broke again, I felt torn\u2014my friend needed me now, but so did my sangha. My mind raced, caught between the urge to comfort Maya and the responsibility to my Buddhist community. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to follow."}
