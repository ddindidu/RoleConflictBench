She was waiting for me in the library, her notes spread out, eyes full of hope and anxiety. I knew how much this opportunity meant to her, and I wanted to give her my undivided attention, to encourage her growth and help her succeed. Just as I was about to join her, a member of my congregation rushed into the mosque, tears streaming down his face. He had just lost a loved one and needed immediate spiritual support. As the imam, I was expected to offer comfort, guidance, and a listening ear in his darkest moment. My heart ached, torn between the urgent need for compassion and the commitment I had made to my mentee. Both needed me, both deserved my full presence, but I could not be in two places at once. The weight of their expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
