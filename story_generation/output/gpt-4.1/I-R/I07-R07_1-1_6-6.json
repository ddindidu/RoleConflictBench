It was from a colleague, just a quick note about an upcoming project\u2014nothing urgent, she said, just for my information. Still, I knew the unspoken rule: respond soon, show you\u2019re engaged, be a good team player. I glanced at the clock. My phone buzzed with a message from my Buddhist friend, inviting me to talk about the sermon we\u2019d heard last night. He wanted to reflect, to share insights, to deepen our understanding together. I felt the pull of both worlds\u2014my work self, always available, always responsive, and my spiritual self, craving the quiet space for contemplation and connection. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my mind split between the expectation to reply promptly and the longing to immerse myself in spiritual conversation. The tension pressed in, each role asking for my presence, each important in its own way. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of choosing which part of myself to honor first."}
