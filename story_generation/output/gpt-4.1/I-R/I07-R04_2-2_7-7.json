The subject line was urgent\u2014my team at work needed my input before they could move forward with the project. I knew they were waiting, probably watching the chat for my response, and I could almost feel their impatience through the screen. But as I sat down, my phone vibrated again, this time with a message from Sister Amina. She sounded desperate, asking if I could meet her as soon as possible. Her family was in crisis, and she needed guidance. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in on me: the expectation to be a reliable colleague, quick to respond and keep the workflow moving, and the responsibility to be present and compassionate as an imam, offering support when my community needed it most. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between drafting a quick reply to my team and calling Sister Amina back. The minutes ticked by, and I could feel the tension building inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
