It was Samir, my closest friend, his voice trembling through the speaker. His car had broken down on the highway, miles from help, and he needed me\u2014now. I could hear the fear in his voice, the loneliness of the empty road pressing in on him. My heart ached; I\u2019d always promised to be there for him, especially in moments like this.\n\nBut as I looked up, the mosque was already filling with people. Tonight was special\u2014a remembrance gathering, and the community expected me, their imam, to lead the prayers. No one else was authorized or prepared. Their eyes, full of hope and trust, met mine as I entered. I felt the weight of their expectations, the sacred responsibility to guide them in worship.\n\nInside, I was torn. My duty as a friend pulled me toward Samir, stranded and scared. My duty as imam anchored me here, where so many relied on me for spiritual guidance. The conflicting demands pressed in, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that needed me at the same time."}
