My team meeting at work was scheduled for 10 a.m.\u2014the same time I was expected to lead the prayer vigil downtown. As a colleague, I was supposed to show up, contribute, and support my team, even if the meeting was just a routine catch-up. My manager always emphasized the importance of being present, and I knew my absence would be noticed, even if the session was recorded. But as a nun, I had been chosen to represent my convent at this public vigil, a rare honor and a responsibility I could not take lightly. The sisters were counting on me to lead with grace and devotion, to be a visible sign of our faith in the community. My phone buzzed with reminders from both worlds, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing down on me. I wanted to be fully present for both, but the demands pulled me in opposite directions, leaving me torn and anxious, my heart pounding as I tried to decide where I truly belonged."}
