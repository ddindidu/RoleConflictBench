He\u2019s been looking forward to this\u2014just us, no distractions, maybe dinner at our favorite place and a long walk by the river. I can see the hope in his eyes when he asks, \u201cSo, what should we do tonight?\u201d I want to give him all my attention, to make this night special.\n\nBut just as I\u2019m about to answer, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s Mei, my friend from the temple. She\u2019s excited, asking if I have time to talk about the sermon we both heard last weekend. She says she\u2019s been struggling with some of the teachings and needs someone to reflect with. I know how important it is to support her, to deepen my own understanding through these conversations.\n\nI feel a knot tightening in my chest. I want to be present for Alex, to nurture our relationship. But I also feel a responsibility to my spiritual path and to Mei. Both matter deeply to me, and both are asking for my time\u2014tonight, the only night I have. My mind races, torn between love and commitment, between worldly connection and spiritual growth."}
