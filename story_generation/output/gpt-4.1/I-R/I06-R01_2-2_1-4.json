The deadline was in three days, and I knew she expected nothing less than my best effort. Every keystroke reminded me of her words: \u201cTake your time, but make sure it\u2019s thorough.\u201d I wanted to prove myself, to show her I was dedicated and capable.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. Her family was in crisis again, and she needed someone to talk to\u2014someone to listen, to pray, to offer hope. As her pastor, I knew how much she depended on me, how my presence could make a difference in her darkest moments.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I focused on the code, I\u2019d neglect Sarah when she needed me most. If I gave her my time, I\u2019d risk disappointing my mentor and falling behind. My heart ached with the tension, torn between the call to serve and the drive to succeed. I stared at the screen, paralyzed, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
