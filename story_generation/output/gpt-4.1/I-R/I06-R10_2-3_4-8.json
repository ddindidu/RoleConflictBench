The code wouldn\u2019t run, and I\u2019d tried every fix I knew. My mentor always said, \u201cLet me know as soon as you hit a wall. Don\u2019t wait.\u201d But my phone buzzed with reminders from my family group chat\u2014today was the festival, the one we only celebrated together every few years. I\u2019d promised to help with the rituals, to be present for every offering and prayer. The temple was hours away, and once I left, I\u2019d be offline for the whole day. My mentor expected updates, transparency, and progress. My family and faith expected my full presence, my hands folded in prayer, my heart in the ceremonies. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my mind racing with guilt and anxiety. Should I send a rushed message to my mentor, risking disappointment, or keep silent and risk falling behind? The festival clothes lay ready on my bed, the laptop open on my desk, and I stood between them, torn and uncertain."}
