It was a message from my manager: \u201cPlease confirm the meeting details with our partner ASAP.\u201d I glanced at the clock. It was almost time for my daily puja, the moment I set aside to light a lamp and offer prayers at my home altar. As a Hindu, this ritual grounds me, a sacred pause in my day that I rarely compromise. But as a colleague, I\u2019m expected to be responsive, especially when leadership is waiting on me. My inbox pinged again, the subject line urgent. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my team counting on my promptness, my faith calling me to pause and connect. I stared at the flickering lamp, feeling the tension coil inside me, torn between the demands of my work and the pull of my spiritual practice."}
