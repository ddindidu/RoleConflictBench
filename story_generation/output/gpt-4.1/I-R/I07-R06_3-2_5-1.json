The client was waiting for our delivery, and my part of the project was the last piece before we could send it off. The deadline was tomorrow, and everyone was counting on me. As a colleague, I knew I had to finish the task, no matter what. But as I reviewed the data, I noticed a discrepancy\u2014something that didn\u2019t add up. Fixing it would take hours, and I\u2019d have to work late into the night. My manager had suggested, almost offhandedly, that I could just \u201csmooth over\u201d the numbers to keep things moving. \n\nBut as a Christian, honesty and integrity are non-negotiable. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the team\u2019s expectations, the client\u2019s trust, and my own commitment to living out my faith. My mind raced with questions. Was I letting everyone down if I insisted on fixing the error? Was I betraying my values if I didn\u2019t? I sat at my desk, torn, the cursor blinking on the screen, the decision looming over me."}
