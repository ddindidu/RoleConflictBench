She confided in me about her struggles to balance work and personal life, her voice tinged with frustration. As her mentor, I felt the weight of responsibility to guide her, to encourage her to invest in herself, perhaps even to suggest she take a short break or enroll in a course to help her grow. I wanted to be the mentor who made a difference, who helped her find her footing.\n\nBut as I listened, my mind wandered to my own struggles. As a Muslim, I felt the growing pressure to perform Hajj. My parents reminded me gently, friends shared their stories, and every year, the call felt louder. Yet, I was still early in my career, barely making ends meet, and saving for Hajj seemed like a distant dream. How could I encourage Aisha to invest in herself when I was postponing my own spiritual journey? The expectations of being a good mentor and a devoted Muslim pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt the tension knotting in my chest as I tried to find the right words."}
