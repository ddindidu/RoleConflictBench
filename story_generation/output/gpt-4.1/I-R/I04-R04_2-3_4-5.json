Today was special\u2014our community was celebrating a milestone, and people had come from far and wide to hear my words. As imam, I knew how much this moment meant. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was Ahmed, my closest friend, his voice frantic. He was on his way to the airport, convinced he\u2019d left his passport at home. \u201cCan you check and bring it to me? I\u2019ll miss my flight otherwise,\u201d he pleaded.\n\nAs a friend, I wanted nothing more than to help him, to be there in his moment of panic. But as imam, I felt the weight of the congregation\u2019s expectations pressing down on me. They were counting on me to guide them, to mark this day with words that would resonate. My mind raced, torn between the urgent call of friendship and the sacred duty of leadership. I stared at my phone, heart heavy, caught between two worlds that needed me at the same time."}
