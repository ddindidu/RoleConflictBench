As an acquaintance, I knew I should approach her gently, offer a warm smile, and make her feel at ease. I wanted to be that friendly presence, someone she could relax around. But as the pastor, I was also responsible for leading the workshop that was about to begin. The community leaders were expecting me to dive into dense theological material, to challenge them and guide them through difficult questions of faith. I could already see a few of them glancing at their watches, waiting for me to start. My mind raced: if I took time to comfort the newcomer, I might delay the workshop and seem unprepared. But if I jumped straight into teaching, I\u2019d leave her alone, reinforcing her sense of isolation. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I felt the tension knotting in my chest as I hesitated between the two paths."}
