The storm advisory blares from my phone\u2014heavy rain, possible power outages. I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of the coming service. As rabbi, I\u2019m expected to offer guidance, to be prepared, to inspire. My congregation counts on me, especially during uncertain times.\n\nBut then I remember Mrs. Goldstein, my neighbor down the hall. She\u2019s lived alone since her husband passed. The advisory mentioned checking on vulnerable neighbors. As a neighbor, I should knock on her door, make sure she has candles, food, and someone to call if the power goes out. I imagine her sitting in the dark, anxious, while I\u2019m busy crafting words of comfort for others.\n\nMy mind spins between these roles\u2014my duty to my congregation, my responsibility to Mrs. Goldstein. Both expect my presence, my care. I stare at my sermon notes, heart pounding, torn between the pulpit and the hallway, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
