The client\u2019s delivery depends on my report, and the deadline is tomorrow morning. My phone buzzes\u2014a gentle reminder from the sangha group: tonight is our weekly study circle, and we\u2019re finally discussing the chapter on right intention, one I\u2019ve been eager to explore. My manager\u2019s earlier words echo in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any delays.\u201d I know my teammates are counting on me; if I don\u2019t finish, the whole project stalls. Yet, my heart aches at the thought of missing the circle. The teachings have been my anchor, especially during stressful weeks like this. I promised myself I\u2019d make time for spiritual growth, not just work. The weight of both commitments presses on me, each tugging in a different direction. I close my eyes, feeling the tension coil in my chest, torn between the expectations of my colleagues and the quiet call of my practice."}
