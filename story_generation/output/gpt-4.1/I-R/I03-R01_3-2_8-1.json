Our argument had spiraled out of control, and now he was questioning if we should even stay together. My heart ached, knowing I needed to reach out, to resolve this, to show him I cared enough to fight for us. But just as I was about to call, my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from a church member, desperate for guidance about a life-altering decision. As their pastor, I was expected to offer calm, spiritual wisdom, to be present and steady for them. But how could I give someone else clarity when my own world felt so uncertain? I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My boyfriend needed my vulnerability and attention; my congregation needed my strength and faith. I stared at the phone, paralyzed, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
