The spreadsheet for the quarterly report was due by noon, and I knew that if I missed the deadline, it would throw off the entire team\u2019s workflow. My colleague, Sarah, had already messaged me twice, asking if I\u2019d be done on time. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014everyone was counting on me to keep things moving smoothly.\n\nBut at the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series was about to start. As the priest, I was expected to lead the discussion, set the vision, and inspire the volunteers. The parish council had emphasized how important this year\u2019s program was for the community, and I knew how much the adults looked forward to these sessions.\n\nI felt torn, my mind racing between spreadsheets and scripture, deadlines and devotion.

My hands hovered over the keyboard, paralyzed by the weight of conflicting expectations, unsure which responsibility to honor first."}
