I\u2019d been told to communicate any challenges, no matter how small, but this question about terminology felt trivial. Still, I wanted to do things right, to show I was engaged and responsible. But the only time my mentor was available for a call this week was Sunday morning\u2014right when I was supposed to be at church. As a Christian, I knew how important it was to be present at weekly services, not just for worship but to support my community. Missing it would mean letting down my church family and, honestly, myself. Yet, if I didn\u2019t take this chance to connect with my mentor, I might seem uncommitted or careless. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt torn, my loyalty and sense of duty pulling me in opposite directions. I sat there, wrestling with the decision, my heart heavy with the weight of disappointing someone, no matter what I chose."}
