She was upset\u2014she thought I\u2019d forgotten our plans for Saturday, and her words stung with disappointment. I knew I needed to call her, to listen, to reassure her that she mattered most. My thumb hovered over her contact, heart pounding with the urgency of fixing things before the misunderstanding grew.\n\nJust then, the heavy church doors creaked open. A parishioner, eyes red and hands trembling, stepped inside. \u201cFather, please, I need to talk. It\u2019s urgent,\u201d she whispered, voice breaking. I could see the desperation in her face, the kind that couldn\u2019t wait. My mind raced: as a boyfriend, I was expected to resolve conflicts, to be present for Emily. As a priest, I was called to offer comfort and guidance, especially in moments of crisis.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My phone buzzed again in my hand, while the woman\u2019s silent plea hung in the air. I stood frozen, heart aching, caught between two worlds that needed me\u2014right now."}
