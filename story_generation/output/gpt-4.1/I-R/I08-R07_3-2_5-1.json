It was Mark, an old friend I hadn\u2019t seen in months. \u201cHey, my car broke down on Elm Road. Can you help me out?\u201d he asked, his voice tinged with worry. I glanced at the clock\u2014just an hour before the memorial service at the temple, a ceremony I\u2019d promised to help organize. As a Buddhist, I knew how important it was to be present, to support the community, especially during rituals that honored those who had passed. But Mark sounded desperate, and I remembered all the times he\u2019d been there for me in the past. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my spiritual community and the expectation to help a friend in need. I could already imagine the disappointment on the faces at the temple if I didn\u2019t show up, but I also pictured Mark stranded and alone on that dark, empty road. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
