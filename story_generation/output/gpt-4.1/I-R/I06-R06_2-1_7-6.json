As her mentee, I felt a deep responsibility to be punctual, prepared, and to make the most of her limited time. Noon was only an hour away, and I rushed to gather my notes, rehearsing my questions in my head.\n\nOn my way out, I passed the front desk and saw the new intern struggling with a stack of files, her face flushed with frustration. She looked up at me, hope flickering in her eyes. As a Christian, I felt the familiar tug to stop, to offer a kind word or a helping hand, to live out the compassion I believed in. But every second I hesitated meant risking being late for my mentor, disrespecting her time and possibly missing my only chance to meet.\n\nI stood frozen, torn between the urgent demands of my roles\u2014mentee and Christian\u2014wrestling with the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
