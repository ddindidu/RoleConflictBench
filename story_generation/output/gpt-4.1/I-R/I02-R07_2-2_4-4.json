She\u2019s been looking forward to it, dropping hints about a cozy dinner and a movie at home. I see the hope in her eyes, the way she\u2019s already set the table and picked out my favorite film. But tonight is also the weekly group meditation at the temple\u2014a practice I\u2019ve committed to, a space where I find peace and clarity. My teacher always says consistency is the heart of mindfulness, and I know how much I need that hour of stillness, especially before a stressful week. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: Mia\u2019s gentle expectation for closeness, the silent call of the sangha and my own spiritual discipline. My heart tugs in two directions, guilt and longing tangled together, as I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, unsure which door to open."}
