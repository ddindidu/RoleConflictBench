I glanced at the screen\u2014three new emails, all marked urgent. The leadership team needed my confirmation for tomorrow\u2019s meeting with our external partner, and I knew they expected a prompt reply. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice: \u201cWe need to lock this down today.\u201d \n\nBut tonight, I wasn\u2019t just a colleague. I was here as a member of my community, about to chant my assigned Torah portion. The rabbi had reminded me how important it was to be present, to honor my commitment to the congregation. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in on me\u2014the responsibility to my team, the promise to my faith. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the urgent demands of work and the sacred stillness of the sanctuary."}
