The congregation expects thoughtful, well-prepared messages, and I feel the weight of that responsibility. My mind starts to wander through possible themes\u2014compassion, forgiveness, the meaning of community\u2014when my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from Eli, my old friend. He\u2019s confused about where we\u2019re supposed to meet later today. I know he\u2019s been feeling distant lately, and I promised myself I\u2019d be more present for him. As a friend, I should reply right away, clear up the confusion, and show him he matters. But as a rabbi, I owe my community my full attention and the best sermon I can offer. My fingers hover over the phone, heart tugged in two directions, the expectations of friendship and leadership pulling at me, each demanding my presence in this moment."}
