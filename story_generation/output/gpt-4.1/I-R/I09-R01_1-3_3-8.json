As a neighbor, I knew the unspoken rule: don\u2019t clutter the sidewalk with extra bags unless the bins are overflowing. But inside my house, bags of workshop materials\u2014leftover food wrappers, paper scraps, and empty coffee cups from the community leaders\u2019 intensive theological workshop\u2014were piling up. As a pastor, I\u2019d encouraged everyone to dig deep, to stay late, to wrestle with faith and practice. The result was a mountain of trash that wouldn\u2019t fit in my own bin.\n\nI could hear Mrs. Lee next door, always vigilant about keeping our shared space tidy. She\u2019d frown if I stacked bags beside the bins. Yet, as a pastor, I felt responsible for setting an example, not just in teaching but in stewardship and honesty. Should I risk my neighbor\u2019s irritation by overfilling the curb, or should I quietly stash the bags in my garage, hoping no one would notice until next week? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood there, torn, the cool evening air thick with indecision."}
