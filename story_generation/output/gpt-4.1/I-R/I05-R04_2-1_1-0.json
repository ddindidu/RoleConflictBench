She was struggling, and I\u2019d promised her detailed feedback before tomorrow\u2019s deadline. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for Maghrib prayer. As the imam, I was expected to lead, but tonight, the congregation would be small, and Brother Ahmed, fully qualified, was already at the mosque. Still, I knew some in the community valued my presence, expecting me to be there regardless of numbers. My mentee, on the other hand, was anxiously waiting for my guidance, counting on me to help her through this critical stage. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my time and attention, each with its own set of expectations. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my student and my duty to the congregation. I stared at the clock, heart pounding, knowing I had to choose, but not yet ready to decide."}
