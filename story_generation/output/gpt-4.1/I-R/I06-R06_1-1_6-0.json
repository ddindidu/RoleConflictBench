My mentor\u2019s office hours were almost over, and I\u2019d promised to come by for feedback on my project. She\u2019d emphasized how important it was to respect her time, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. But as I gathered my things, I overheard two classmates in the hallway, whispering about cheating on the upcoming exam. My conscience screamed at me\u2014my faith taught me to stand for what\u2019s right, to not turn a blind eye to dishonesty. I felt torn. If I confronted them or reported what I\u2019d heard, I\u2019d miss my mentor\u2019s office hours and risk disappointing her. If I ignored it, I\u2019d be betraying my values. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, my heart pounding as I stood frozen between the door to my mentor\u2019s office and the voices echoing down the hall."}
