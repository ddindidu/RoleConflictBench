As an acquaintance, I knew the unspoken rule: don\u2019t gossip, don\u2019t spread rumors, don\u2019t be the reason someone\u2019s reputation is tarnished. But the information weighed heavily on me\u2014Ramesh had been taking bribes, and his actions had hurt several families in our community. My upbringing as a Hindu echoed in my heart, reminding me of dharma, the duty to stand up for what is right, to act with integrity and protect others from harm. The expectation was clear: I should not stay silent in the face of wrongdoing. Yet, the thought of exposing Ramesh filled me with dread. Would I be betraying the trust of those who confided in me? Would I become the very person I promised myself I\u2019d never be\u2014someone who speaks ill of others?
