My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cI expect you to finish this sample before our next meeting.\u201d The deadline was tight, and I knew how much he valued diligence and follow-through. I wanted to prove myself, to show that I was worthy of his guidance.\n\nJust as I was making progress, my phone buzzed. A message from the mosque committee: \u201cA large gathering has assembled for the remembrance. We need you to lead the prayers\u2014no one else is authorized.\u201d My heart pounded. As the imam, I was responsible for guiding the community, especially during important occasions like this. They looked to me for spiritual leadership, and I couldn\u2019t let them down.\n\nBut the code sample still sat unfinished, and the clock was ticking. I felt torn, pulled by the weight of two worlds\u2014one demanding my intellectual focus, the other my spiritual presence. My mind raced, anxiety building as I tried to figure out how to meet both expectations, knowing that something would have to give."}
