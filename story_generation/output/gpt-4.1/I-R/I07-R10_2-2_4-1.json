My colleague, Priya, had just messaged me, reminding me that my part of the project was due by noon. I knew how important it was\u2014if I missed the deadline, her work would be delayed, and the whole team would feel the impact. But as the clock ticked closer to 11:30, I felt a different kind of pressure building inside me. It was almost time for my daily puja, the moment I set aside every day to light the lamp and offer prayers at my home altar. My parents had always taught me the importance of this ritual, and skipping it felt like letting go of a piece of myself. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me: the responsibility to my team, and the duty to my faith. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between finishing the report and stepping away for my prayers, my mind wrestling with the fear of disappointing someone\u2014either my colleagues or myself."}
