She was quiet, her arms folded, and I knew she was questioning if we should even be together. As her boyfriend, I felt the weight of responsibility to fix things, to say the right words and resolve our conflict before it grew any worse. But just then, we passed by a temple, vibrant with colors and music\u2014today was a festival, one I\u2019d promised my family I\u2019d attend. The scent of incense and the sound of chanting pulled at me, reminding me of my duty as a Hindu to participate in the rituals, to honor my faith and my family\u2019s expectations. I glanced at her, then at the temple, feeling torn. If I stopped to join the ceremony, I\u2019d be leaving her alone in the middle of our fight. If I stayed with her, I\u2019d be letting down my family and my beliefs. My heart pounded as I stood between the two worlds, unable to move, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
