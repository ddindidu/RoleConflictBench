My heart ached for him. As his girlfriend, I wanted to do something\u2014anything\u2014to comfort him. He looked up at me, eyes pleading, and asked if we could order his favorite takeout: pepperoni pizza, the kind he always craves when he\u2019s down. I hesitated, glancing at the pantry where I\u2019d just stocked up on kosher snacks and ingredients. I knew how much it would mean to him if I joined him, sharing a slice, showing him I was there for him in every way. But the thought of eating non-kosher food made my stomach twist with guilt. I could offer him the kosher snacks, but would that feel like enough? I wanted to be the supportive girlfriend he needed, but I also wanted to honor my Jewish values. The two parts of me pulled in opposite directions, and I stood there, torn, wishing I didn\u2019t have to choose."}
