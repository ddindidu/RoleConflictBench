She was leaving for a week and asked if I could keep an eye out for her packages, especially since the building would have a planned power cut. I\u2019d always tried to be a good neighbor\u2014helpful, reliable, someone people could count on. But this time, my heart was torn. My family had planned for months to travel to my ancestral village for a major Hindu festival. It was a rare chance to be with relatives, to immerse myself in rituals and prayers that connected me to my roots. The expectation was clear: I should be present, fully engaged, honoring my faith and family. Yet, I couldn\u2019t ignore the trust my neighbor placed in me. The thought of her deliveries piling up, or something going wrong during the outage, gnawed at me. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each pulling me in a different direction. My mind raced, caught between the warmth of community and the call of tradition, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
