As a nun, these moments are precious, a time to reconnect with my purpose and seek guidance. But just as I settled in, my phone buzzed with a message from a group of acquaintances. They were meeting at the caf\u00e9 nearby, and I felt a tug of obligation\u2014I hadn\u2019t seen them in weeks, and I knew they valued my presence. When I arrived, the conversation quickly turned to the recent decisions of a mutual colleague. The group\u2019s tone shifted, voices lowering, words edged with judgment. As an acquaintance, I was expected to join in, or at least listen without protest, but my heart twisted. My vows as a nun called me to avoid gossip, to seek understanding and compassion, not criticism. I felt the weight of their expectant glances, the pull between my desire to belong and my commitment to a higher calling. The words swirled around me, and I sat, torn, the book I\u2019d meant to read still in my bag, my spirit caught between two worlds."}
