She clung to my hand, her eyes red and swollen, searching for comfort I desperately wanted to give. I knew she needed me here, to hold her, to listen, to simply be present as she grieved her father\u2019s sudden passing. My phone buzzed again\u2014a message from the mosque committee. The regular backup imam was out of town, and the congregation was gathering, expecting me to lead the evening prayer. I could picture the rows of worshippers waiting, relying on me for guidance and stability, especially tonight. My heart twisted as I looked at my partner, torn between the duty to my community and the love I owed her in this moment of pain. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between two worlds that needed me at the same time."}
