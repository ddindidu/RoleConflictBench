As her mentee, I felt a deep responsibility to show up, to respect her time and the rare opportunity to learn from her before she disappeared for weeks. \n\nBut tonight was also the evening I had set aside for myself, a quiet stretch with no obligations, the perfect time to recite and reflect on the Quran. I had been looking forward to this all week, craving the peace and connection it brought me as a Muslim. The thought of postponing it made my chest tighten with guilt, as if I was letting myself and my faith down. \n\nI stared at the clock, torn between honoring my mentor\u2019s effort and honoring my own spiritual needs. The two expectations pulled at me, each demanding my presence, each feeling too important to ignore. My mind raced, heart heavy, as I tried to decide which part of myself I would have to disappoint."}
