He looked tired, his eyes searching mine for a moment of connection. \u201cHey, do you know any good restaurants around here? I\u2019m new in town and could use a friendly recommendation,\u201d he asked, his voice hopeful. As an acquaintance, I felt the familiar tug to be helpful, to offer a warm suggestion and maybe even join him for a meal, just to make him feel welcome.\n\nBut my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. The mayor\u2019s message flashed on the screen: \u201cSister, we need you at the community center. The hurricane\u2019s aftermath is worse than we thought. Hundreds are without shelter. Can you help organize the relief effort?\u201d As a nun, my heart ached for those suffering, and I knew my community expected me to be present, to lead, to serve.\n\nI stood there, torn between the simple kindness of helping a friend and the overwhelming responsibility to my calling. My mind raced, guilt and duty wrestling inside me, as I tried to decide which need was greater in that moment."}
