I don\u2019t know how he still has a job.\u201d I felt a familiar discomfort. As an acquaintance, I knew I should avoid gossiping or speaking negatively about others, but Sam\u2019s expectant eyes waited for my agreement or at least a reaction. I didn\u2019t want to seem unfriendly or judgmental, but I also didn\u2019t want to betray my own values.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my friends: \u201cWe\u2019re booking our Hajj tickets tonight! Are you in?\u201d My heart ached. I had been saving for years, setting aside money for this sacred journey, but the cost was high, and I worried about my finances. The pressure from my friends was strong\u2014they expected me to join them this year, and I longed to fulfill this pillar of my faith.\n\nCaught between the urge to fit in with my colleagues and the spiritual pull of Hajj, I felt the weight of conflicting expectations pressing down on me, unsure which path to take."}
