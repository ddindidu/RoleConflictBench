I winced, knowing Mrs. Lee next door would be annoyed\u2014she\u2019d already left a polite note about the noise last week. As a neighbor, I want to be considerate, to keep the peace in our shared building, to respect boundaries. But just as I was about to leash my dog and take him outside, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mark, a member of my congregation. He was in crisis, desperate for guidance, and he needed to talk now. As his pastor, I\u2019m expected to be present, to offer spiritual counsel when it matters most, especially when someone\u2019s choices could change the course of their life. I stood in the hallway, torn. My dog\u2019s barking grew louder, and I imagined Mrs. Lee\u2019s frustration mounting. At the same time, I pictured Mark, waiting for a call that might help him find hope. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each expecting me to do the right thing. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which need to answer first."}
