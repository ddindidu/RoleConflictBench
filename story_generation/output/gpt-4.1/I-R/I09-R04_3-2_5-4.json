My neighbor, Mrs. Rahman, had left her walker and a few boxes outside her door again. As her neighbor, I knew she struggled to keep her apartment uncluttered, and I\u2019d always tried to be patient and considerate, helping her when I could. But the HOA was strict, and I worried about the consequences for both of us if the corridor wasn\u2019t clear.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with reminders from the mosque committee. I was the sole imam scheduled for today\u2019s Friday sermon, and the topic\u2014\u201cCompassion in Community\u201d\u2014had been announced for days. The congregation expected me to be there, prepared and on time. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the neighbor who should help Mrs. Rahman and ensure the corridor was clear, and the imam who must not be late or distracted for the Khutbah. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the demands of my faith and my responsibility next door, unsure which duty to answer first."}
