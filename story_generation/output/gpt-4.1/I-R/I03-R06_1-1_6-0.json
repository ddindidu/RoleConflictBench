He sounded upset that I\u2019d made plans with my church group on Saturday, the same day he\u2019d hoped we\u2019d spend together. As his girlfriend, I knew I should call him, talk it out, and smooth things over. That\u2019s what a good partner does\u2014resolves conflicts, listens, and makes compromises. But as a Christian, I also felt the weight of my commitment to my faith. Saturday\u2019s event wasn\u2019t just social; it was a service project I\u2019d promised to help with, and I wanted to keep my word. I tried to remind myself to be patient, gentle, and honest, just as my faith teaches. But my heart twisted with anxiety. If I put my church first, would Mark feel neglected? If I put him first, would I be letting down my values? The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I felt torn, unsure which path would honor both my relationship and my beliefs."}
