I glance at the clock\u2014Maghrib has just passed, and I had planned to spend this quiet evening reciting and reflecting on the Quran, something I rarely get to do without interruption. The thought soothes me; my heart longs for the peace that comes with those verses. But then I remember Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor who lives alone just down the hall. The storm could knock out the power, or worse, and she has no family nearby. As her neighbor, I know I should check in, maybe offer to bring her some candles or just reassure her that someone is close by. Yet, the pull to stay in my own apartment, to immerse myself in the Quran as I had hoped, tugs at me just as strongly. I stand in the hallway, torn between the comfort of my faith and the duty of kindness to those around me, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in from either side."}
