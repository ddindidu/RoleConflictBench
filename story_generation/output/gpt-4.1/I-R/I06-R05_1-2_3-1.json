The congregation expects inspiration, clarity, and a sense of peace from my words. I feel the weight of their anticipation, knowing I must prepare something meaningful before sundown. Yet, as I try to focus, a small question about a Hebrew term nags at me\u2014a detail from my studies that I don\u2019t fully understand. As a mentee, I\u2019m supposed to reach out to my mentor whenever I hit a snag, no matter how minor. But is this really urgent enough to interrupt my mentor\u2019s day? I hesitate, torn. If I email now, I\u2019ll be fulfilling my responsibility as a diligent student, but it will pull me away from the sermon that so many are counting on. If I wait, I risk letting my uncertainty fester, possibly leading to bigger misunderstandings later. My mind races, caught between the needs of my congregation and the expectations of my mentor, unsure which role to honor first."}
