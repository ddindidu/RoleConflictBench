On one side, my mentee\u2019s project plan, full of red marks and sticky notes from our last check-in. She was struggling, and I\u2019d promised to review her latest draft tonight, to give her the guidance she needed before her big presentation. On the other side, a stack of sutras and my teacher\u2019s handwritten invitation, asking me to summarize key teachings for tomorrow\u2019s temple session. It was an honor, and I knew how much my teacher valued thoughtful reflection and preparation.\n\nMy phone buzzed\u2014a message from my mentee, anxious and hoping for feedback before midnight. At the same time, I glanced at the clock, realizing I had only a few hours left to immerse myself in the teachings, to find the clarity and peace expected of me as a Buddhist. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the responsibility to guide and support, and the call to deepen my own understanding and share it with others. My mind raced, torn between the needs of another and the demands of my own spiritual path, uncertain which to serve first."}
