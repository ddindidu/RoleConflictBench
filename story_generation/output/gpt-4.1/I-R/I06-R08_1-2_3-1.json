There\u2019s a term in the project brief I don\u2019t quite understand. It\u2019s not urgent, but I know I\u2019m supposed to communicate any confusion right away. My mentor always says, \u201cDon\u2019t let small questions pile up.\u201d I hover over the send button, but my mind drifts to the Quran on my shelf. Ramadan is halfway through, and I\u2019m behind on my daily reading. I promised myself I\u2019d catch up tonight, but the day\u2019s fast has left me tired, and the thought of reaching out to my mentor feels like another task pulling me away from my spiritual goals. I want to be a good mentee, responsible and proactive, but I also want to honor my commitment to recite and reflect on the Quran, especially now. The expectations tug at me from both sides, and I feel the weight of choosing which role to fulfill first."}
