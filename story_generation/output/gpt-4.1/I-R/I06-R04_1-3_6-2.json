My mentor\u2019s office hours were about to start, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss this chance. He\u2019d made it clear\u2014respect his time, don\u2019t be late, don\u2019t reschedule. I owed him that much, after all he\u2019d invested in me. But as I slipped on my shoes, a message came from the mosque: a large crowd had gathered for a special remembrance, and the usual imam was away. No one else was authorized to lead. The community was waiting, expecting me to step forward, to guide them in prayer, to be present for them in this moment. My heart pounded. I could picture my mentor, waiting in his office, perhaps checking his watch, maybe even disappointed. At the same time, I could feel the weight of the congregation\u2019s silent hope, their trust in me as their imam. I stood in the hallway, torn, the expectations of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore."}
