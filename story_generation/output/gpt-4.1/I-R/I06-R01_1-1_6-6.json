As a mentee, I knew how important it was to respect my mentor\u2019s time. She had set aside open office hours this week, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d make the most of them, never taking her availability for granted. But as a pastor, I felt a different pull. Someone in the group mentioned feeling lost, and before I knew it, I was sharing a story from scripture, weaving in lessons about hope and faith. The group leaned in, hungry for comfort, and I saw how much they needed this. Yet, as I spoke, I felt the minutes slipping away\u2014minutes I\u2019d meant to spend with my mentor, learning and growing. My heart twisted with guilt. Was I letting down my mentor by staying here? Or was I failing my congregation if I left now, just when they needed guidance? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which expectation I should honor first."}
