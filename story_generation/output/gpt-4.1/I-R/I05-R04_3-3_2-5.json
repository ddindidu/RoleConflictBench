As a mentor, I had promised to help Aisha navigate a pivotal career decision\u2014her dream job offer had come, but with strings attached. She waited anxiously for my guidance, her future hanging on my words. I had spent the week preparing a detailed plan to walk her through every scenario, determined not to let her down.\n\nBut as the imam, today was no ordinary Friday. Our community was celebrating a milestone, and people had travelled from distant towns to hear my sermon. The mosque committee had emphasized the importance of my presence, expecting a message that would inspire and unite everyone. My phone buzzed with reminders, and I could already hear the early arrivals gathering outside.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my full attention at the same moment. My heart pounded as I stared at my notes, torn between the promise I made to Aisha and the responsibility I owed my congregation."}
