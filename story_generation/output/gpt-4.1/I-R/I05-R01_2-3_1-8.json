He was struggling with the final phase of his project, and I\u2019d promised to review his work and offer feedback before tomorrow\u2019s deadline. As his mentor, I knew how much he depended on my guidance, especially now when his confidence was faltering. I glanced at the clock\u2014just an hour left before the workshop I\u2019d spent weeks preparing as a pastor. The community leaders were gathering soon, expecting me to lead them through a dense, thought-provoking session on applying our faith in daily life. They looked to me for clarity and inspiration, and I felt the weight of their trust. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to support Alex and the responsibility to teach and shepherd my congregation. Both roles demanded my full presence, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, feeling the pressure of expectations pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which call to answer first."}
