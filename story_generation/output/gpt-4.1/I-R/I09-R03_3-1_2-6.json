As a nun, these moments are precious, a time to reconnect with my faith and find peace in silence. I settled into my chair, book in hand, when a knock at my door startled me. It was Mrs. Kim from down the hall, her face tight with concern. She mentioned the noise complaint that had been circulating on our floor and invited me to a meeting in the lobby to discuss it. As a neighbor, I knew I was expected to be friendly, polite, and present, especially in tense situations like this. But as a nun, I felt a deep pull to honor my commitment to spiritual study, to keep this time sacred and undisturbed. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the gentle demands of community and the quiet call of contemplation, unsure which path to follow."}
