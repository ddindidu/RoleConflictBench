It was Priya, her voice trembling, asking if I could talk. She\u2019d just had a terrible fight with her partner, and I could hear the pain in her words. As her friend, I knew she needed me to listen, to be there for her without judgment or distraction. But as she poured out her story, I realized she was being treated unfairly\u2014her partner\u2019s words had crossed a line, violating the very principles of dharma I hold dear as a Hindu. My heart ached with the urge to speak up, to tell her she deserved better, to urge her to stand up for herself. Yet, I also knew my role as a friend was to listen, not to impose my beliefs or push her before she was ready. The expectations tugged at me from both sides, and I felt the weight of wanting to do right by her as a friend and as someone who believes in standing up for justice. My mind raced, torn between comforting her and voicing my convictions, unsure which path would truly help her most."}
