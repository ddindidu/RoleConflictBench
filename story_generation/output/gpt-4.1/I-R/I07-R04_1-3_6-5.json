As a colleague, I knew I was expected to respond to emails and messages promptly, even if the sender had noted there was no immediate action required. My phone buzzed with a new message from a coworker, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility. At the same time, as the imam, I was minutes away from delivering the Friday sermon\u2014a special one this week, marking a significant milestone for our community. People had travelled from far and wide, their expectations heavy in the air. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. Should I quickly reply to the message, maintaining my reputation as a reliable colleague, or focus entirely on the sermon, honoring the trust and anticipation of the congregation? My heart pounded as I wrestled with the demands, torn between the quiet ping of my phone and the growing murmur of the waiting crowd."}
