I knew I was supposed to communicate any challenges, even small ones, but the question about terminology felt so minor. It could wait, I told myself. But then my phone buzzed\u2014another message from the church council. A family in our congregation had just lost their home in a fire. They needed me to organize support, to be present, to offer comfort and guidance. My mind raced. As a mentee, I should reach out, keep the lines open, show I\u2019m engaged and responsible. But as a pastor, my community needed me now, not later. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my attention, each with its own expectations. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between sending the email and rushing out the door. The tension twisted in my chest, and I wondered how I could possibly be both the attentive mentee and the present pastor at the same time."}
