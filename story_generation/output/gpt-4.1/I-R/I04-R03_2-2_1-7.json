It\u2019s Anna, my oldest friend, her voice trembling as she asks if I have a moment. She\u2019s had another argument with her partner, and I can hear the tears she\u2019s trying to hold back. My heart aches for her; I know she needs me to listen, to be the friend who always makes time, who offers comfort and understanding.\n\nBut as I glance at the clock, I remember Sister Margaret\u2019s reminder: a parishioner is coming soon, seeking guidance for a crisis of faith. As a nun, I am expected to be present, spiritually prepared, and focused, offering wisdom and solace rooted in prayer and reflection. My mind races\u2014Anna\u2019s pain is immediate and raw, but so is the responsibility I carry for those who look to me for spiritual support.\n\nI feel torn, guilt pressing in from both sides.

The weight of these expectations pulls me in opposite directions, and I sit in silence, phone in hand, heart pounding, unsure which role to answer first."}
