She\u2019s been looking forward to it, planning a quiet dinner and a walk by the river. I see the hope in her eyes when she talks about it, and I want nothing more than to be there, to show her she matters. But as I\u2019m about to leave the rectory, my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder that tonight is also the weekly religious education class. The parents count on me to guide their children, and the parish expects my presence and leadership. I know how important these classes are, how much the kids look up to me, and how disappointed everyone would be if I canceled or showed up distracted. My heart aches as I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the warmth of her waiting smile and the duty that calls me to serve. The weight of both worlds presses down, and I can\u2019t see how to be enough for both."}
