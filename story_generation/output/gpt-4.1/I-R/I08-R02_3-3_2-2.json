The community expected me to be there, to guide them, to be the steady presence they relied on. As I hurried along the path, I saw Anna, an acquaintance from the neighborhood, sitting on a bench, her shoulders shaking with sobs. I hesitated, torn. As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to stop, to offer comfort, to be the friendly face she might need in this moment of pain. But as a priest, I knew the congregation was waiting, counting on me to begin the service on time, to uphold the tradition that meant so much to them. My heart ached with the weight of both expectations, the urge to help Anna battling with the duty to my community. I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which path to take."}
