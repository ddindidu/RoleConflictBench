The air was thick with incense, and the community was gathering for the evening aarti. As a Hindu, I felt a strong pull to join in, to be part of the prayers and celebrations that only happen once a year. Just as I was about to step into the temple courtyard, my phone buzzed. It was my friend, sounding frazzled. He\u2019d just started assembling his new bookshelf and was completely lost. \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? I really need your help,\u201d he texted. I knew he\u2019d been looking forward to setting up his new place, and as his friend, I wanted to be there for him, especially since he rarely asks for help. But the festival was important to me and my family, and I could already see my relatives waving me over. My heart pounded as I stood on the sidewalk, torn between the warmth of the festival and the urgency in my friend\u2019s message, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
