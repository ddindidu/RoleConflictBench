On the other end, my friend\u2019s voice trembled, thick with tears. She\u2019d just learned her brother had been in a terrible accident. Instinctively, I wanted to listen, to simply be there, to let her pour out her pain without judgment or advice. That\u2019s what she needed\u2014her friend, not her pastor.\n\nBut as she sobbed, I felt the weight of my other role pressing in. I\u2019d spent the evening preparing a sermon about trusting in God\u2019s plan, about finding hope in suffering. Should I share those words now? Was it my place to guide her spiritually in this raw moment, or would that feel like preaching when she just needed comfort? My mind raced with the expectations of my congregation, who looked to me for guidance, and the silent plea of my friend, who just wanted someone to listen. I sat there, phone pressed to my ear, heart torn between the friend she needed and the pastor I was supposed to be."}
