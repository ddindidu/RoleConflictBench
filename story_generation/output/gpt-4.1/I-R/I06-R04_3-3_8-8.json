He had carved out this precious hour for me, squeezing our session between meetings and travel. I knew how much he valued punctuality and preparation, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t waste a second of his time. As I gathered my notes, ready to head to the call, a knock echoed through the mosque. A young man stood at the door, eyes red, shoulders trembling. He barely managed to say, \u201cImam, please, I need to talk. I just lost my father.\u201d His pain was raw, and I could see he needed comfort, guidance\u2014someone to listen, right now. My heart twisted. As an imam, I was expected to be present, to offer solace in moments like this. But as a mentee, I owed my mentor respect, and this was my only chance for weeks. I stood frozen, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
