My mentor had just texted: \u201cLet\u2019s meet in 20 minutes. I have a tight window.\u201d I knew how rare it was for her to squeeze me in, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second of her time. But my stomach rumbled\u2014I hadn\u2019t eaten since morning, and the only kosher-certified vendor nearby was a ten-minute walk in the opposite direction. If I went, I\u2019d barely make it back in time, maybe even risk being late. If I skipped the meal, I\u2019d be distracted and lightheaded during our meeting, hardly the attentive mentee she expected. The thought of grabbing something quick from a non-kosher caf\u00e9 gnawed at me, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the dietary laws I\u2019d kept since childhood. My mentor expected me to be prepared and respectful of her schedule, but my faith demanded I honor my commitment to kosher. I stood on the busy sidewalk, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
