As a mentor, I had promised my mentee, Sarah, that I would review her project draft tonight. She was anxious, relying on my feedback to steer her through a maze of uncertainty. My phone buzzed with her message: \u201cIs there any way you could look at it tonight? I\u2019m really stuck.\u201d I knew she needed me to be present, to guide her step by step.\n\nBut earlier that evening, I\u2019d noticed Mark, a quiet member of my congregation, lingering after the service. His eyes were red, his shoulders slumped. I\u2019d offered a few gentle words, but he needed more\u2014someone to listen, to pray with him, to help him find hope. As his pastor, I felt the weight of his pain, the expectation that I would be there for him in his darkest hour.\n\nNow, torn between Sarah\u2019s urgent need for practical guidance and Mark\u2019s silent plea for spiritual comfort, I felt the pressure mounting. My heart ached, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both of them what they needed at the same time. I stared at my phone, paralyzed, unsure which call to answer first."}
