I just want to scream.\u201d I knew she needed someone to listen, to let her vent, and as her friend, I wanted to be there for her. But I was already running late for my volunteer shift at the soup kitchen, something I\u2019d committed to as part of living out my faith\u2014showing love and kindness, just as Jesus taught. I stared at her message, feeling the weight of both roles pressing on me. If I stopped to call Sarah, I\u2019d be late and let down the people counting on me at the kitchen. If I ignored her, I\u2019d be a bad friend, failing to support her when she needed me. My heart twisted with guilt and frustration, torn between being the friend Sarah needed and the Christian I wanted to be. I hesitated, phone in hand, caught in the tension of two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
