My mentee, Sarah, had just emailed me her draft for the community outreach project\u2014a task so delicate that a single misstep could jeopardize months of trust-building. As her mentor, I felt the weight of responsibility to review her work thoroughly, to offer the kind of detailed feedback that could only come from careful, undivided attention. Yet, as I opened her document, my phone buzzed with a reminder: it was time to begin brainstorming for my upcoming Shabbat sermon. The congregation expected inspiration, wisdom, and relevance, and I knew that crafting a meaningful message required deep reflection and early preparation. I felt the tension coil in my chest. If I focused on Sarah now, I risked letting my sermon preparation slide, possibly disappointing those who looked to me for spiritual guidance. But if I turned to my sermon, I might fail Sarah at a critical moment in her growth. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I found myself paralyzed, torn between the needs of my mentee and the needs of my congregation."}
