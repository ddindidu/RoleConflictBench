She had come to me for guidance, her voice trembling as she described the crossroads she faced\u2014choices that could change her life forever. I could see how much she needed me to listen, to offer the spiritual counsel she sought. But then I glanced at my phone and saw a message from Mark, an old friend and casual acquaintance. His car had broken down on a deserted road, and he was asking if I could come help him out. I knew he wouldn\u2019t have reached out unless he truly needed someone. My mind raced\u2014Sarah\u2019s pain was raw and immediate, but Mark was stranded and vulnerable. Both needed me, but in completely different ways. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, my heart torn between being the supportive friend and the compassionate pastor. I sat there, phone in hand, caught between two calls for help, unsure which role I could bear to let down."}
