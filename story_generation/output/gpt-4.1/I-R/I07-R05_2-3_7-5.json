They\u2019re waiting for my clarification on a project detail\u2014without it, the task stalls, and I know the expectation: prompt, reliable communication. I glance at the clock. In ten minutes, I\u2019m supposed to meet with Miriam, a conversion candidate, for her final, crucial study session before her Beit Din. She\u2019s anxious, and I promised her my full attention, to guide her through the last questions and reassure her with Torah and kindness. \n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My colleagues need me to be present, responsive, a dependable part of the workflow. Miriam needs me to be her rabbi, her teacher, her support in a moment that could shape her spiritual life. My mind races, torn between the pinging urgency of the office and the sacred responsibility waiting in the next room. I stare at the screen, heart pounding, caught between two calls that both feel impossible to ignore."}
