She had asked me to receive it since she often misses deliveries, and as a good neighbor, I agreed. I felt a sense of responsibility\u2014after all, we look out for each other in small ways, and I wanted to be helpful. \n\nBut as I sat by the window, watching for the delivery truck, my phone buzzed with a message from work. Someone had cut in line for a coveted project assignment, and I was one of the few who noticed. As a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to uphold dharma\u2014moral and ethical principles\u2014even in small matters. I felt a tug to speak up, to ensure fairness, but the timing was terrible. If I left my post to address the issue at work, I might miss the delivery and let my neighbor down. If I stayed, I\u2019d be ignoring my inner call to act ethically. \n\nI sat there, torn, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which expectation I should honor first."}
