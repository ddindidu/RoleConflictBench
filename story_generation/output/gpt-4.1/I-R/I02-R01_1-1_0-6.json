As her boyfriend, I wanted to wrap her in my arms, listen, and reassure her that everything would be okay. She needed comfort, not advice. But as the evening wore on, we joined a small group from church for coffee. Someone brought up a story from scripture, and Emily, trying to join in, made a lighthearted comment that missed the deeper meaning. The group looked to me, expecting the pastor to gently correct and guide. I felt the weight of their silent anticipation. Should I step in and teach, risking making Emily feel exposed or inadequate in front of friends? Or should I let it go, supporting her as a partner, even if it meant neglecting my pastoral duty? My heart pounded as I glanced at Emily, her eyes searching mine for understanding, while the group waited for my response."}
