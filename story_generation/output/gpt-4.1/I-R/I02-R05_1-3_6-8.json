She was upset\u2014apparently, I\u2019d forgotten we\u2019d planned to spend Saturday together. I could feel the tension in her words, the disappointment. As her boyfriend, I knew I needed to call her, talk it through, and make things right. That\u2019s what she expected from me: to be present, to resolve our conflicts, to show her she mattered.\n\nBut just as I was about to dial, my phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message from the synagogue president. One of our beloved congregants had passed away unexpectedly. The family needed me to officiate the funeral, and they wanted it as soon as possible\u2014Saturday morning. My heart twisted. As their rabbi, I was their guide in moments of grief, the one who brought comfort and tradition to their loss.\n\nI sat there, phone in hand, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. Rachel needed me. My community needed me. I could already sense the disappointment in both directions, and I didn\u2019t know how I could possibly be enough for everyone."}
