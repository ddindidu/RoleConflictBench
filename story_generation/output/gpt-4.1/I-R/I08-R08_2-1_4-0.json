I could already imagine the quiet, the gentle rhythm of recitation, the peace that always settled over me when I took time to reflect. Just as I was about to begin, my phone buzzed. It was Samir, an acquaintance from work. He sounded a bit desperate\u2014his moving help had canceled last minute, and he needed someone to help carry boxes to his new apartment. I could hear the stress in his voice, and I knew he didn\u2019t have many people to call. As an acquaintance, I felt I should step up, offer support, be there when someone needed a hand. But as a Muslim, I had promised myself this evening for spiritual reflection, something I\u2019d been neglecting lately. The two expectations pulled at me, and I sat there, phone in hand, heart heavy, torn between helping someone in need and honoring my commitment to my faith."}
