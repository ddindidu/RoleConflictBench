She\u2019s been looking forward to this, planning for us to go to the big community dinner everyone\u2019s been talking about. I want to make her happy, to be present and share this time, especially since we\u2019ve both been so busy. But as we walk into the hall, I scan the buffet and my heart sinks. None of the food is labeled kosher, and I can\u2019t find anyone who knows for sure. There\u2019s no way to bring in my own meal, and I know she\u2019s excited to try everything with me. I feel her hand squeeze mine, her eyes bright with anticipation, and I feel the weight of my own expectations pressing in\u2014her hope for a carefree evening together, my commitment to keeping kosher. I want to be the boyfriend she deserves, but I can\u2019t ignore the part of me that\u2019s Jewish, that\u2019s always been careful about what I eat. The noise of the room fades as I stand there, caught between two worlds, not sure which part of myself I\u2019m supposed to let down."}
