Today\u2019s team meeting was crucial\u2014our manager had made it clear that the project updates would only be discussed live, and missing out meant falling behind. As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute, to show commitment. But just as I was about to log in, my phone buzzed again. It was David from the synagogue. They needed one more person for the minyan to say Kaddish at a funeral. Without me, the prayer couldn\u2019t happen, and the mourners would be left without the comfort of tradition. My heart pounded. I felt the weight of my team\u2019s expectations, the importance of not letting them down. At the same time, I felt the pull of my faith, the responsibility to my community, and the knowledge that my presence was essential. I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, each demanding something only I could give, and I didn\u2019t know which way to turn."}
