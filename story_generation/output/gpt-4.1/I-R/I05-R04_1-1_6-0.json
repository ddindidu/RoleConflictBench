During a casual check-in, I noticed that Ahmed, one of my mentees, was struggling with time management. He confided in me about his overwhelming workload and how he wished he had more time to focus on his studies and self-improvement. I wanted to sit with him, help him map out a plan, and give him the support he needed right then and there.\n\nBut as the imam, I was also expected to lead the daily prayers at the mosque. The congregation was small today, and another qualified worshipper was present and could easily step in. Still, I knew that my regular presence brought comfort and consistency to the community, and some members might feel disappointed or unsettled if I wasn\u2019t there to lead.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn between the urge to fulfill my duty as a mentor and the responsibility I carried as an imam. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt the tension rising as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
