My friend, Jamie, had just texted, clearly confused about where we were supposed to meet. I knew if I didn\u2019t reply right now, she\u2019d probably end up waiting somewhere else, frustrated and alone. As her friend, I felt the pressure to clear things up immediately, to be there for her and not let a simple misunderstanding ruin our plans.\n\nBut just as I was about to type, I overheard a heated argument nearby. A stranger was being unfairly accused of something he didn\u2019t do. I felt a deep tug inside me\u2014my Christian values urging me to step in, to stand up for truth and justice, even if it meant getting involved in a messy situation. My heart pounded. If I intervened, I might miss the chance to help Jamie, but if I ignored what was happening, I\u2019d be turning my back on what I believe is right.\n\nCaught between the urgent need to be a good friend and the call to live out my faith, I felt paralyzed, torn by the weight of both expectations."}
