My mentor\u2019s email glared at me from the screen, reminding me that the report needed to be finished before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation. I knew how much my mentor was counting on me\u2014this was my chance to prove myself, to show I could handle responsibility. But just as I started typing, my phone buzzed. It was a desperate message from a member of my congregation, pleading for help. She was in crisis, her voice trembling as she asked if I could meet her tonight. As her pastor, I knew my presence could make all the difference; she was facing a decision that could change her life forever. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my mentor and the calling to guide someone through darkness. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, my heart pounding as I stared at the unfinished report and the blinking message, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both."}
