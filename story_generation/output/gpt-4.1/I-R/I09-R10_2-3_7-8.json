Tonight was the festival I had waited for all year, a sacred time to honor my faith and family traditions. My parents had called twice, reminding me how important it was to be present, to participate in every ritual and offering. As I zipped my suitcase, my phone buzzed with a storm advisory\u2014heavy rain, possible flooding, and power outages. I glanced at Mrs. D\u2019Souza\u2019s door across the hall. She lived alone, her children far away, and I knew she depended on neighbors for small things\u2014receiving packages, checking in during emergencies. I remembered her frail hands as she waved to me yesterday. My heart twisted. Should I leave for the festival, fulfilling my religious duty, or stay back to make sure she was safe through the storm? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood in the hallway, suitcase in hand, torn between my roles."}
