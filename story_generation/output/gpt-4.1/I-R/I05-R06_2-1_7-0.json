She was preparing for a big promotion, and I knew how much this opportunity meant to her. As her mentor, I was expected to encourage her growth, to help her navigate the competitive world she was about to enter. She confided in me about a shortcut she\u2019d discovered\u2014one that would give her an edge but involved bending the truth on her project results. She looked at me, searching for approval, for guidance.\n\nInside, I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As a Christian, I strive to live by honesty and integrity, values I try to carry into every part of my life. But as her mentor, I also want to support her ambitions and help her succeed. The pressure to give her the advice she wanted clashed with my own beliefs about what was right. I could see the hope in her eyes, and I could feel the weight of my responsibility to both her and my faith. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my role as a mentor and my commitment to my Christian values."}
