The deadline was clear\u2014tomorrow, before upper management\u2019s evaluation. My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cThis is your chance to show your growth. Don\u2019t let me down.\u201d I wanted to prove myself, to meet every expectation, to be the mentee she could rely on.\n\nBut as I reached for my pen, Sister Agnes knocked gently on my door. \u201cThere\u2019s someone here to see you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s troubled, questioning his faith. He asked for you.\u201d As a nun, I knew my calling was to offer comfort, to listen, to guide those in spiritual need. The parishioner\u2019s pain was urgent, his crisis of faith a wound I could not ignore.\n\nMy heart pounded. If I left my work, I might not finish in time, disappointing my mentor and risking my progress. But if I stayed, I would turn away someone seeking solace, betraying my vows. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore. I closed my eyes, torn between duty and devotion, unsure which path to follow."}
