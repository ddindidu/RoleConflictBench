He greeted me with a warm smile and asked if I knew any good restaurants nearby\u2014he wanted to take his wife out for their anniversary. I could see he was hoping for a thoughtful suggestion, maybe even a story or two about my own experiences. As I started to answer, Mrs. Thompson, a member of my congregation, hurried over. Her eyes were red, and her voice trembled as she asked if I had a moment to talk. She needed guidance\u2014her son was in trouble again, and she didn\u2019t know what to do. I felt the weight of both their expectations pressing on me: Mark\u2019s friendly request for help, and Mrs. Thompson\u2019s desperate need for support. My mind raced, torn between the casual camaraderie of an old friend and the deep responsibility I felt as a pastor. I could feel my heart pounding, caught in the tension of wanting to be present for both, but knowing I couldn\u2019t give either the attention they truly deserved at the same time."}
