The storm advisory flashes across the screen\u2014heavy rain, possible power outages. I remember Mrs. Goldstein, my elderly neighbor, who lives alone just two doors down. As her neighbor, I know I should check in, maybe offer to bring her something or help her prepare. But I\u2019m also hungry, and my stomach reminds me I haven\u2019t eaten since morning. Traveling for work, I\u2019d planned to grab a quick meal, but in this unfamiliar city, only one small vendor nearby is kosher-certified. If I go now, I can eat before the storm hits, but I\u2019d have to leave Mrs. Goldstein alone a bit longer. If I check on her first, I might miss my chance for a kosher meal. My mind spins with the weight of both roles\u2014my duty to care for a neighbor in need, and my commitment to keeping kosher. The hallway feels colder as I stand there, torn, the storm clouds gathering outside and inside me."}
