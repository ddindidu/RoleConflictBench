As a mentee, I knew I was expected to finish this assignment\u2014my mentor trusted me to deliver, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. But as I typed, I glanced up and saw a coworker quietly slip ahead in the lunch line, bypassing others who had been waiting. My upbringing as a Hindu pressed on my conscience, reminding me of the importance of dharma\u2014doing what is right, even in small moments. Should I speak up, gently remind my coworker about fairness, or stay silent and focus on my work? If I intervened, I might lose precious time needed for my assignment, risking my mentor\u2019s disappointment. If I ignored it, I\u2019d feel I was betraying my values. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I sat frozen, torn between the expectations of my mentor and the quiet voice of my conscience."}
