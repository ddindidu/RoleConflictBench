We\u2019ve planned this dinner for days, and I can see how much he\u2019s looking forward to it too. As we wait for our table at the restaurant, I notice a coworker from my office quietly slipping ahead in the reservation line, pretending not to see the others waiting. My upbringing as a Hindu tugs at me\u2014my parents always taught me to stand up for what\u2019s right, even in small things. I feel a responsibility to say something, to gently remind her of fairness and honesty. But Arjun squeezes my hand, his eyes full of anticipation, and I know he just wants to forget about work and enjoy our rare time together. My heart pounds as I weigh the urge to speak up against the desire to keep our evening light and undisturbed. The two parts of me\u2014devoted girlfriend and principled Hindu\u2014pull in opposite directions, and I can\u2019t ignore the tension building inside."}
