The weight of expectation pressed on me\u2014everyone would be there, waiting for words that would inspire and guide. I needed to be focused, to find the right message, to honor the tradition and the moment. As I rounded the corner, I saw Miriam, an acquaintance from the congregation, walking toward me. She smiled, her eyes bright with the hope of a friendly exchange. I knew she expected warmth, a moment of connection, maybe even a listening ear if she needed it. But my mind was tangled in scripture and stories, and I felt the pull of my rabbinic duties urging me to keep moving, to stay in my head, to not lose my train of thought. I slowed, caught between the need to be present for her as a friend and the pressure to prepare for the congregation as their rabbi. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role to honor in that fleeting moment."}
