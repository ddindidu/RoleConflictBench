The room feels heavy with her grief, and I want nothing more than to hold her, to be the steady presence she needs. My phone buzzes quietly on the table\u2014a reminder for the weekly group meditation at the temple. I\u2019ve never missed a session; it\u2019s my anchor, the hour I dedicate to mindfulness, to cultivating compassion and clarity. But now, my partner\u2019s pain tugs at me, her need for comfort immediate and raw. I know she expects me to stay, to listen, to be her support. At the same time, my Buddhist practice calls me to the cushion, to the community, to the discipline I\u2019ve promised myself. My heart aches with the pull in both directions. I want to be present for her, but I also feel the weight of abandoning my own spiritual commitment. The clock ticks on, and I sit frozen, torn between the person she needs and the person I strive to be."}
