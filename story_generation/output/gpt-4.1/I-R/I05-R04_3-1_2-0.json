My mentee, Sarah, sat across from me, her eyes wide with anxiety as she laid out the details of a job offer that could change her life. She needed my guidance now, more than ever\u2014she was counting on me to help her weigh the risks, to provide the structured advice I\u2019d promised when I agreed to be her mentor. Yet, as the minutes slipped by, I felt the familiar tug of my other calling. The mosque was just next door, and though the congregation was small today, I was expected to lead the prayer. Another brother was available, but tradition and my own sense of duty pressed on me. I could see Sarah\u2019s hope and uncertainty, and I could feel the weight of the congregation\u2019s expectation. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice: to stay and guide Sarah through this pivotal moment, or to fulfill my role as imam, leading the faithful in prayer."}
