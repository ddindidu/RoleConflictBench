This was our last weekend together before she moved abroad, and I could feel the weight of every minute slipping away. She reached for my hand, her eyes searching mine, and I knew she wanted us to make the most of this time\u2014just us, no boundaries, no holding back. But as her fingers laced through mine, I felt a familiar tension coil in my chest. My faith had always guided my choices, reminding me to honor Christian values, especially when it came to intimacy and boundaries. She leaned closer, her voice barely above a whisper, asking if I wanted to spend the night with her, just this once, before she left. The longing in her eyes was matched by the ache in my heart, torn between the love I felt for her and the commitment I had made to my beliefs. The caf\u00e9 buzzed around us, but all I could hear was the pounding of my own heart as I wrestled with what to do next."}
