    "Story": "I sat across from Jamie, my mentee, as she nervously tapped her pen against her notebook. She\u2019d missed another deadline, and I could see the frustration in her eyes. As her mentor, I wanted to push her\u2014help her set priorities, develop discipline, and grow into the professional I knew she could be. But as I prepared to offer advice, my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been quiet lately, and I knew she was struggling with grief. As her pastor, I felt the weight of her pain, the expectation to offer comfort and spiritual reassurance.\n\nI found myself torn. Jamie needed practical, perhaps tough, guidance to overcome her challenges, but Mrs. Carter needed gentle words and a listening ear. The demands of both roles pressed in on me\u2014one calling for firmness, the other for compassion. I felt the tension rising in my chest, unsure how to balance the expectations placed upon me, and wondering which part of myself I would have to set aside, even if just for a moment."
