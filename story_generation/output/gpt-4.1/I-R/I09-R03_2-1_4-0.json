Sister Agnes had already reminded me last week about the importance of peace and quiet in our shared living spaces, especially since some of our elderly neighbors are sensitive to noise. As a neighbor, I know I should keep my dog calm and respect the boundaries we all share. But as a nun, I am expected to be present at the food drive, helping to organize donations and serve those in need. The event is starting soon, and my absence would be noticed. Yet, if I leave now, my dog might disturb the neighbors again, and I worry about their complaints and the disharmony it could cause. I stand in the doorway, torn between my duty to my neighbors and my calling to serve, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
