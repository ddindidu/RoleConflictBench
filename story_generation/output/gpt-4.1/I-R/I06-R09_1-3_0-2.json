She\u2019d suggested some optional reading, nothing urgent, but I knew she expected me to be thorough and prepared for our next meeting. I wanted to impress her, to show I was dedicated and eager to learn. But as I flipped through the pages, my mind kept drifting to my son in the next room, struggling with his Torah portion. His bar mitzvah was only a month away, and he still stumbled over the Hebrew words. As a Jewish parent, it was my responsibility to guide him, to make sure he understood not just the words, but the meaning behind them\u2014the traditions, the values, the history that shaped us. I felt pulled in two directions: the desire to meet my mentor\u2019s expectations and the duty to my child and my faith. My heart ached with guilt, knowing that whichever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
