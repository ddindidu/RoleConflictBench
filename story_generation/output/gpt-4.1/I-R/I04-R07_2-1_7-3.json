My friend\u2019s message is sharp, wounded\u2014she\u2019s misunderstood my joke, and now she thinks I\u2019m upset with her. I know I should call her right away, clear things up before the hurt grows. That\u2019s what a good friend does: communicate, don\u2019t let misunderstandings fester. But I also see the time. In just a minute, I\u2019m supposed to begin my daily meditation, a quiet ten-minute window I promised myself I\u2019d never skip. As a Buddhist, I know how important it is to keep this commitment, to practice mindfulness and not let the world\u2019s noise pull me away. My mind tugs in two directions\u2014one voice urging me to pick up the phone, the other whispering to sit, breathe, and let go. I feel the tension in my chest, the guilt of possibly letting my friend down, the anxiety of breaking my own spiritual promise. I close my eyes, torn, the phone heavy in my hand, the silence pressing in."}
