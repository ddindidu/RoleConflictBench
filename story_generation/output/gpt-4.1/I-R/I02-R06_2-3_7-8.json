We\u2019d argued about money again\u2014how much to save, what to spend, who was being careless. As her boyfriend, I knew I should try to resolve things, to listen and find a way forward together. But I was tired, frustrated, and the words we\u2019d exchanged still stung. \n\nThen, her phone buzzed. She read a message, and her face crumpled. Her friend\u2019s father was in the hospital, and she needed to go. I saw the pain in her eyes, the fear, and I knew this was a moment when she needed love and compassion\u2014what my faith teaches above all else. But I was still angry, still hurt. I wanted to comfort her, to be the person Jesus calls me to be, but part of me wanted to hold onto my resentment, to let her see how much she\u2019d hurt me. The expectations of being a good boyfriend and a good Christian pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, heart pounding, unsure which voice to follow."}
