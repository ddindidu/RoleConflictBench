My mentee, Sarah, had just emailed me her latest draft for the project, asking for urgent feedback before her big presentation on Monday. She was counting on me, and I knew how much this meant to her. As her mentor, I felt responsible to guide her, to be present and thorough, to help her grow. But as I opened her document, my eyes drifted to the stack of books and notes for my Shabbat sermon. The congregation expected inspiration, wisdom, and preparation. Shabbat was only a day away, and I hadn\u2019t yet found the right words to address the community\u2019s recent struggles. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014Sarah\u2019s anxious hope, my community\u2019s silent anticipation. I felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions, each demanding my full attention, each deserving it. My heart raced as I stared at the screen, paralyzed by the impossible choice before me."}
