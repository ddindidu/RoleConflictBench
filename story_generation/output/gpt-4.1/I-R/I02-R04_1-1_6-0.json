She was upset\u2014apparently, I\u2019d forgotten our plans for Saturday, and now she thought I didn\u2019t care. My chest tightened. As her boyfriend, I knew I should call her, talk it through, and clear up the misunderstanding before it grew into something bigger. She always said communication was important to her, and I wanted to be the kind of partner who listened and resolved things quickly.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I realized it was almost time for Maghrib. As the imam, I was expected to lead the prayer, even though tonight the congregation would be small and Brother Ahmed was more than capable of stepping in. Still, I knew some of the elders valued consistency, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. My phone buzzed again\u2014Sara, asking if we could talk now. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my presence in a different way. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, caught between the call of duty and the call of love, unsure which door to walk through."}
