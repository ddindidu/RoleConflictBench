As an acquaintance, I knew I should smile, perhaps stop for a brief, friendly word\u2014she always appreciated a warm greeting, and I didn\u2019t want to seem distant or cold. But as a nun, I was already late for the special healing service being held for Sister Agnes, who had fallen ill. The Mother Superior had emphasized the importance of our presence, reminding us that our prayers were needed now more than ever. My heart pounded as I neared Sister Maria. If I stopped, I\u2019d be even later, risking disapproval and feeling as though I\u2019d failed my spiritual duty. But if I hurried past without acknowledgment, I\u2019d betray the kindness and approachability expected of me as a member of this close-knit community. The tension twisted inside me, my steps slowing as I tried to decide which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
