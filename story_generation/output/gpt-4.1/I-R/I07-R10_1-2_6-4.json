It was marked informational, with a note that no immediate action was needed. Still, I knew the unspoken rule: respond within a reasonable time, show you\u2019re engaged, be a good team player. As I started to type a quick acknowledgment, I overheard a conversation nearby. My friend, Raj, was being unfairly criticized by another coworker for a mistake he didn\u2019t make. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I believe in standing up for what\u2019s right, in dharma\u2014moral duty. I felt a surge of responsibility to intervene, to speak up for Raj, even if it meant risking my own standing. But the expectation to be a responsive, reliable colleague tugged at me. Should I finish my email first, or should I step in immediately? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I sat frozen, torn between the urge to act and the need to fulfill my professional obligations."}
