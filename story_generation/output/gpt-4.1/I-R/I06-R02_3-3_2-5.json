The deadline was tomorrow, and I knew upper management would scrutinize every detail. My mentor had emphasized the importance of this task, reminding me that my future in the program depended on it. I tried to focus, but the church door creaked open, and a woman stumbled in, her face streaked with tears. She clutched her hands together, desperate, and I recognized the signs of someone in crisis. As a priest, I was expected to offer comfort, to listen, to be present for those in need\u2014especially in moments like this. My heart twisted. I could hear my mentor\u2019s voice in my head, urging me to finish the assignment, but the woman\u2019s sobs echoed through the sanctuary. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing, caught between duty to my mentor and my calling as a priest."}
