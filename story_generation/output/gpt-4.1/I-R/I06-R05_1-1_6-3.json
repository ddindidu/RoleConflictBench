As a mentee, I knew how precious my mentor\u2019s open office hours were\u2014she carved out time for us despite her packed schedule, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never take that for granted. Today was one of those rare windows, and I\u2019d been looking forward to discussing my questions with her all week.\n\nBut as a rabbi, I also had a responsibility. The adult education class I\u2019d scheduled was about to begin. It was optional, yes, and drop-in, but I knew a few regulars would come, hoping for guidance and insight. Teaching Torah wasn\u2019t just a job; it was a calling, and I felt the pull to be present for my community, even if only a handful showed up.\n\nMy phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for my mentor\u2019s office hour. At the same time, I heard voices gathering in the next room for the class. My heart pounded as I stood between the two doors, torn by the expectations of both roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully honor both at once."}
