She was upset that I hadn\u2019t confirmed our Saturday night plans, and now she was hinting that maybe I didn\u2019t care enough. As her boyfriend, I knew I should call her, talk things through, and make sure she felt heard. That\u2019s what a good boyfriend does\u2014resolves conflicts, doesn\u2019t let misunderstandings fester. But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered tomorrow was Sunday. I hadn\u2019t been to church in weeks, always telling myself I\u2019d go when I had time. My faith mattered to me, and I missed the sense of peace and community worship brought. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014Mia needed me to be present and attentive, but my faith called me to reconnect, to show up and participate. My heart tugged in two directions, guilt and longing mixing together. I wanted to be the boyfriend Mia deserved, but I also wanted to be the Christian I aspired to be. I sat there, phone in hand, torn between the expectations of love and faith, unsure which path to take."}
