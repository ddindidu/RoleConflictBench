I noticed a young woman standing alone, her eyes darting nervously, clutching her purse. As an acquaintance, I felt the gentle tug of duty to approach her, to offer a smile, a kind word, to help her feel welcome. I knew how much it meant to be seen, to be included.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was to lead the prayer vigil in less than an hour. The convent expected me to be present, composed, and spiritually prepared. I could not be late, nor could I arrive flustered. The weight of representing my sisters and my faith pressed on my shoulders.\n\nI glanced at the shy woman again, her loneliness almost palpable. My heart ached with the desire to reach out, but the clock ticked relentlessly. The expectations of my roles pulled me in opposite directions, and I stood frozen, torn between the warmth of human connection and the solemn call of my vocation."}
