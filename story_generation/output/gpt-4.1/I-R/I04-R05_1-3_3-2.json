I\u2019m losing my mind with these IKEA instructions.\u201d He\u2019s just moved into his new apartment, and I promised I\u2019d be there for him, especially after his recent breakup. I know how much he needs a friend right now. But my laptop is open in front of me, the blank page for my High Holiday sermon staring back. The service is tomorrow, and the congregation is counting on me to offer words of comfort and inspiration. I can almost hear the expectant hush of the sanctuary, the weight of tradition and community pressing on my shoulders. My heart aches for David, but my mind races with unfinished thoughts for the sermon. I feel torn, pulled between the immediate need of a friend and the sacred responsibility to my community. My hands hover over the keyboard, my phone buzzing again, and I feel the tension coil tighter inside me, unsure which call to answer first."}
