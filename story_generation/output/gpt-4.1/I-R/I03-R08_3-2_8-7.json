Our argument from last night still echoed in my mind\u2014sharp words, accusations, and the threat of breaking up hanging between us. As his girlfriend, I felt the weight of expectation to fix things, to reach out, to show that I cared enough to fight for us. But my heart was pulled in another direction. My friends were finalizing their plans for Hajj, and the money I\u2019d saved for years was finally enough. As a Muslim, this was my chance to fulfill a lifelong obligation, a pillar of my faith. Yet, Amir wanted me here, to talk, to heal what was broken. My friends were leaving soon, and if I missed this window, I might not get another chance for years. The pressure built inside me\u2014my duty to my relationship clashing with my duty to my faith. I stared at the screen, torn, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, unsure which path to choose."}
