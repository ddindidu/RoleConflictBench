It was Mark, someone I knew from the community, but not well\u2014a friendly acquaintance. \u201cHey, I know this is last minute, but my parents are visiting and I want to take them somewhere special for dinner tonight. Any recommendations?\u201d I could hear the hope in his voice, the kind that expects a quick, thoughtful answer. As a rabbi, I knew I needed to be at the synagogue soon, to greet Ethan\u2019s family, to make sure everything was in place for this milestone. But as an acquaintance, I felt the pull to help Mark, to be the person he could rely on for something as simple as a restaurant suggestion. My mind raced, torn between the obligation to the family waiting for me at the synagogue and the small, human connection Mark was seeking. I stood in the doorway, phone in hand, heart pounding, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I could afford to disappoint."}
