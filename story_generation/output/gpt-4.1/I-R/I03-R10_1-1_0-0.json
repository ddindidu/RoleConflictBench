He tried to smile, but I could see the exhaustion in his eyes. As his girlfriend, I wanted to be there for him, to listen and offer comfort, maybe even make his favorite tea. But as he started talking about his day, my phone buzzed with a reminder: it was time for my evening puja. I had already skipped the full ritual this morning, whispering a quick mantra under my breath between meetings, promising myself I\u2019d make it up later. Now, guilt gnawed at me. My family always taught me the importance of daily rituals, that skipping them was disrespectful to the divine. Yet, Arjun needed me right now. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my faith and toward the person I loved. I nodded along to his words, but inside, I was wrestling with the weight of both expectations, unsure which part of myself to honor in this moment."}
