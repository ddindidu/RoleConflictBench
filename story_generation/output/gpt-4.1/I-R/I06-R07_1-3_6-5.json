My mentor\u2019s office hours are this afternoon, and I know how much she values punctuality and commitment. She\u2019s made it clear that mentees should make the most of her availability, and I don\u2019t want to seem ungrateful or disorganized. But today is also the weekly group meditation, and as the leader, everyone expects me to guide the session with calm presence and focus. The group relies on me to set the tone, to help them find stillness. I can\u2019t just skip it or rush through the practice. My mind races, torn between the urge to honor my mentor\u2019s time and the responsibility I feel toward my sangha. I try to breathe deeply, but the tension only grows. If I leave meditation early, I\u2019ll disappoint the group and betray my own values. If I miss my mentor\u2019s office hours, I risk her disappointment and my own progress. The expectations press in from both sides, and I sit in the quiet, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
