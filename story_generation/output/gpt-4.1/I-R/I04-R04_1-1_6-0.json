My friend, Ahmed, had texted again\u2014he was confused about where we were supposed to meet later, and I knew if I didn\u2019t reply now, the misunderstanding would only grow. As his friend, I felt the weight of needing to clear things up, to be there for him and not let a simple miscommunication turn into hurt feelings. But just then, the call to prayer echoed through the mosque. I was the imam, expected to lead the small congregation gathered inside. Another brother, fully capable, was already standing near the front, glancing at me as if to ask if I wanted him to step in. My heart pounded. Should I fulfill my duty as imam, or quickly message Ahmed and risk being seen as inattentive to my religious responsibility? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt torn, caught between the needs of my friend and the trust of my community."}
