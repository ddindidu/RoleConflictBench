Any night you want.\u201d My heart fluttered. We hadn\u2019t had a real date in weeks, and I missed the easy laughter, the warmth of his hand in mine. I scrolled through my calendar, searching for a free evening, but my eyes caught on the note Sister Agnes had left on my door: \u201cSpecial healing service for Sister Maria, Wednesday at 7. Please attend.\u201d It wasn\u2019t part of our usual prayers, but everyone was expected to be there, to show support and faith. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. He wanted me\u2014needed me\u2014to choose him, to make time for us. But my sisters needed me too, to stand with them in prayer, to be present for someone suffering. I could already hear his disappointment if I said no, and I could feel the silent judgment of my community if I didn\u2019t show up.
