As rabbi, I knew I needed to start preparing a meaningful sermon\u2014something that would resonate, something timely. The pressure to inspire and guide my congregation always weighed on me, especially as the weeks ticked by. I was mentally listing possible themes when I saw Miriam, an acquaintance from the community, sitting alone on a bench, her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs.\n\nAs an acquaintance, I felt the pull to approach her gently, to offer comfort and a listening ear. She looked so vulnerable, and I knew she\u2019d appreciate a friendly presence. But the rabbi in me was anxious; I had set aside this hour to brainstorm sermon ideas, and my schedule was already tight. If I stopped now, I\u2019d fall behind, and the congregation expected thoughtful, well-prepared messages. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me\u2014one demanding compassion in the moment, the other requiring discipline and foresight. My heart ached with indecision as I hovered between the two paths, uncertain which expectation to meet first."}
