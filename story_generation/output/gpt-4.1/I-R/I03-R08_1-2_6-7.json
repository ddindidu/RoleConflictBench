He was upset that I hadn\u2019t confirmed our weekend plans, and now he thought I was avoiding him. My heart ached\u2014I wanted to call and smooth things over, to show him I cared and could resolve our misunderstandings. That\u2019s what a good girlfriend does, right? But my mind kept drifting to the envelope tucked away in my drawer, the one with my Hajj savings. My friends were booking their tickets this week, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d join them. It was a once-in-a-lifetime chance, something my faith and family had always encouraged. But if I used my savings for Hajj, I wouldn\u2019t have enough for the trip Amir and I had planned together. I felt torn, pulled between the expectations of being a supportive girlfriend and a devoted Muslim. My chest tightened as I weighed the disappointment in Amir\u2019s voice against the longing in my heart to answer the call to pilgrimage. I sat there, phone in hand, unable to move, caught between two worlds that both meant everything to me."}
