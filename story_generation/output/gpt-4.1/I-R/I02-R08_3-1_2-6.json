My heart ached to comfort her, to be the steady presence she needed. She looked at me, eyes swollen, searching for words I couldn\u2019t find. I wanted to be her anchor, to stay by her side every moment, to help her through the storm of grief. But in the quiet spaces between her sobs, my mind drifted to the letter from my uncle in Mecca, reminding me that this year\u2019s Hajj was within reach if I acted quickly. As a Muslim, the call to perform Hajj weighed heavily on me, a duty I\u2019d longed to fulfill since childhood. Yet, my savings were barely enough, and leaving now would mean abandoning Aisha when she needed me most. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014her need for comfort, my faith\u2019s sacred obligation. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me, unsure which path would betray less of myself."}
