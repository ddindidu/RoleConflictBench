The stakes were high\u2014one misstep could cost the company dearly. He looked to me for clear, practical advice, expecting me to share every ounce of knowledge I had, to guide him through the technical maze. I felt the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders. But as I listened, I noticed the tremor in his voice, the way his eyes darted away. He wasn\u2019t just worried about the task; something deeper was troubling him. As his pastor, I wanted to pause, to offer him comfort, to ask about his heart and his burdens. Yet, I knew that in this moment, he needed a mentor\u2019s precision, not a pastor\u2019s gentle words. The expectations of both roles pulled at me\u2014one demanding clarity and expertise, the other compassion and spiritual care. I hesitated, torn between the urge to guide him through the technical challenge and the call to tend to his spirit. The silence stretched, and I wrestled with which part of myself he needed most right now."}
