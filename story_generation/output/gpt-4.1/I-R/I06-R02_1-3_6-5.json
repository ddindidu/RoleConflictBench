My mentor\u2019s open office hours were about to begin, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d make the most of them\u2014she\u2019d cleared her schedule for us, and I knew how much she valued punctuality and commitment. I gathered my notes, rehearsing the questions I wanted to ask, determined not to waste her time.\n\nJust as I reached for my coat, the church door creaked open. A woman stumbled in, her face streaked with tears, her hands trembling. \u201cFather, please,\u201d she whispered, \u201cI need to talk. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Her pain was raw, urgent, and I could feel the weight of her need pressing on me.\n\nMy mind raced. As a mentee, I owed my mentor respect\u2014she\u2019d invested so much in me, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. But as a priest, I was called to be present for those in crisis, to offer comfort and guidance when it was needed most. My heart pounded as I stood between the door and the pew, torn by the demands of both worlds, uncertain which path to take."}
