As a nun, these quiet hours of spiritual study are precious\u2014time to reflect, to listen for God\u2019s voice. Yet my mind keeps drifting back to the technical hurdle I\u2019ve hit in my project. As a mentee, I\u2019m expected to reach out to my mentor whenever I face obstacles, to communicate openly and seek guidance. The problem is urgent; if I don\u2019t address it soon, I\u2019ll fall behind. But the thought of breaking this sacred silence, of setting aside my spiritual reading to draft an email or make a call, feels like a betrayal of my commitment to this contemplative life. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward the duty I owe my mentor, and the devotion I owe to God. I stare at the blinking cursor on my laptop, the scripture open beside me, torn between the world\u2019s demands and the quiet call of my faith."}
