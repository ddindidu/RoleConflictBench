I\u2019ll miss you so much.\u201d My heart ached, knowing this was our last chance to be together before he left for months. I wanted to savor every moment, to hold his hand and talk late into the night, to reassure him\u2014and myself\u2014that distance wouldn\u2019t change us. But as I packed my bag, my phone buzzed again. This time, it was from the mosque committee: \u201cThe backup imam is still out of town. We\u2019re counting on you to lead the prayers this weekend.\u201d I felt the weight of their trust, the responsibility to guide the congregation, especially when so many relied on me for spiritual comfort. My mind spun with guilt and longing. How could I be present for my partner when my community needed me? How could I let down the people who looked to me for guidance? My heart pulled in two directions, each role demanding all of me, and I stood frozen, torn between love and duty, unable to choose."}
