The team meeting was about to start, and I knew this one was important\u2014our manager had emphasized that the project updates would be discussed in detail, and there wouldn\u2019t be a summary sent out later. Missing it meant missing out, and I didn\u2019t want to let my colleagues down or seem disengaged.\n\nJust as I was about to log in, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She rarely reached out, but her words were heavy: \u201cDo you have a moment? I really need to talk.\u201d I could sense the weight behind her request, the kind of need that couldn\u2019t be postponed. As a pastor, I was expected to be there, to offer comfort and guidance when someone was struggling.\n\nI stared at the meeting invite on my screen and Sarah\u2019s message on my phone, my heart pulled in two directions. Both roles demanded my presence, both felt urgent, and I was left wrestling with which expectation I would have to let down."}
