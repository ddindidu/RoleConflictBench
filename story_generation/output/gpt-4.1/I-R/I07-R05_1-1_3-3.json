The deadline wasn\u2019t pressing\u2014there was plenty of buffer, and my teammates could keep moving without my part for now. Still, I knew my manager expected me to stay on top of things, to show reliability and commitment. \n\nBut tonight was also the adult education class at the synagogue. It wasn\u2019t mandatory, just a drop-in session on a broad topic, but I knew some people looked forward to these evenings. As their rabbi, I felt a responsibility to be present, to teach, to answer questions, to nurture their curiosity about Torah and Jewish law. \n\nI stared at my calendar, feeling the weight of both roles. If I stayed late at work, I\u2019d be a dependable colleague, but I\u2019d miss the chance to connect with my community. If I left for the class, I\u2019d fulfill my calling as a rabbi, but risk seeming less committed to my team. The expectations tugged at me from both sides, and I sat there, heart pounding, unsure which part of myself to honor tonight."}
