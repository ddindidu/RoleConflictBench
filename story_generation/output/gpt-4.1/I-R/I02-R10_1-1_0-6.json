The air was thick with the scent of marigolds and incense\u2014today was a festival day, and the street buzzed with color and music. I felt a familiar tug in my chest; as a Hindu, I was raised to honor these moments, to join in the prayers and rituals, to show respect for my faith and community. But Priya\u2019s silence pulled at me too. She\u2019d had a rough day at work, I could tell by the way her shoulders slumped and how she barely smiled at the children running past us. I wanted to stop, to ask her how she was, to listen and be the boyfriend she needed\u2014her comfort, her support. Yet, the call of the temple bells and the expectant glances from neighbors made me hesitate. Should I stay with Priya, focus on her, or should I step into the temple, fulfilling my role as a Hindu? The two worlds pressed in on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
