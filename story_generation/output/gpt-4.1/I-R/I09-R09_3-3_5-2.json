The HOA inspection notice was taped to my door, warning that anything blocking the hallway would be cited. I knew my neighbors expected me to keep the shared space clear, especially with safety at stake. But inside, I felt the weight of another responsibility. My son\u2019s bar mitzvah was only weeks away, and he still struggled with his Torah portion. Every evening, I promised myself I\u2019d carve out more time to help him practice, to pass on the traditions and values that meant so much to our family. Yet, the only quiet place big enough for us to rehearse was the hallway, where we\u2019d set up chairs and music stands. I could hear my neighbors\u2019 footsteps, and I imagined their frustration at the mess. I wanted to be a good neighbor, but I also wanted to be a good parent and a good Jew. The two roles tugged at me, each demanding more than I felt I could give. I stood in the doorway, torn, unsure which expectation I would have to let down."}
