My family\u2019s Diwali ceremony was about to begin, and I knew how important it was to arrive on time, dressed in my traditional kurta. Yet, here I was at a friend\u2019s party, introduced to a new person who looked lost and anxious in the crowd. As an acquaintance, I felt the urge to stay, to be warm and welcoming, to help them feel at ease. But my phone buzzed with messages from my mother, reminding me not to be late for the puja. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the gentle conversation with the newcomer and the growing pressure to leave. I could see the hope in their eyes, grateful for my attention, while my mind raced with images of my family waiting, the lamps lit, the prayers about to start. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which expectation I should honor."}
