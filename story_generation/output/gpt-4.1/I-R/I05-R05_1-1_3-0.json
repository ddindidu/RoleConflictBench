The clock ticked toward the end of the lunch break, and I knew I should be sketching out ideas for my upcoming Shabbat sermon. The congregation expected thoughtful, relevant messages\u2014words that would resonate and guide them. Yet, as I tried to focus, my mentee, Sarah, knocked softly and poked her head in. She had another question about navigating her new teaching role, and I could see the uncertainty in her eyes. As her mentor, I wanted to be present, to share what I\u2019d learned and help her grow.
