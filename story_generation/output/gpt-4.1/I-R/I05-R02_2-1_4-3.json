The project deadline loomed, and I knew how much they depended on me to break down the skills they needed. I wanted to give them my best\u2014clear explanations, practical examples, encouragement. Just as I was finalizing my outline, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Anna, a parishioner. She asked if I might have time to talk, not urgently, but soon\u2014she\u2019d been feeling lost and hoped for some guidance.\n\nAs a mentor, I felt the weight of my commitment to my students, the responsibility to help them succeed. But as a priest, I knew Anna\u2019s request was more than a casual inquiry; it was a quiet plea for support, and I was expected to be present, to listen, to offer comfort. I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, torn between the structured demands of my mentoring session and the unpredictable, sacred duty of spiritual care. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I found myself caught in the silent struggle of choosing whom to serve first."}
