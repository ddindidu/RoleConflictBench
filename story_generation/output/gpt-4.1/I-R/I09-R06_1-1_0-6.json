She looked tired, her arms full of grocery bags. As a neighbor, I know the polite thing is to smile, say hello, and keep moving\u2014just enough to be friendly, not intrusive. But as a Christian, I feel a deeper tug, a call to show real kindness, to offer help, maybe even carry her bags or ask if she needs anything. I remember the teachings about loving your neighbor, about going the extra mile. Yet, I hesitate. Mrs. Lee is private, and I worry about overstepping, making her uncomfortable, or seeming nosy. The expectations of being a good neighbor\u2014friendly but not too involved\u2014clash with my faith\u2019s urging to act with open-hearted love. I stand there, caught between a polite nod and a genuine offer of help, my heart wrestling with what I should do next."}
