As her mentor, I knew I needed to push her\u2014to challenge her to reach higher, to be honest about the stakes and the areas where she still needed to improve. My words could make the difference between her seizing this opportunity or letting it slip away. But as a Christian, I felt the pull to offer comfort, to show compassion and gentleness, to remind her that her worth wasn\u2019t defined by her performance. I could see how fragile her confidence was, and I worried that too much criticism might break her spirit. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me: one demanded I be tough and unflinching, the other urged me to be soft and supportive. My heart ached as I wrestled with what to say next, torn between the call to guide her growth and the call to show her unconditional kindness."}
