He wanted to talk it out, to smooth things over right away, and I knew that was what a good girlfriend would do\u2014resolve conflicts, not let them fester. But as he reached for my hand, guiding me toward the buffet, my heart sank. The food looked delicious, but none of it was kosher, and there was no way to substitute anything here. I could see the expectation in his eyes: share a meal, reconnect, let the act of eating together help us move past our misunderstanding. But I also felt the weight of my own commitment, the quiet but insistent voice reminding me of the dietary laws I\u2019d promised myself to keep. I stood there, torn, the noise of the room fading as I wrestled with the impossible choice between being the girlfriend he needed and the person I promised myself I\u2019d be."}
