She confessed she was overwhelmed, her deadlines piling up, her energy fading. As her mentor, I felt the urge to step in, to offer extra support, maybe even schedule a weekend session to help her organize her tasks and regain her confidence. That\u2019s what a good mentor does\u2014shows up, goes the extra mile, helps someone grow.\n\nBut as I glanced at my calendar, I saw the familiar block of time reserved for Sunday morning church service. My faith is my anchor, and being present at worship each week is not just a routine\u2014it\u2019s a commitment to my beliefs and my community. I know how much my church family relies on me, and how much I rely on them.\n\nThe two expectations pressed in on me, each demanding my presence, my time, my heart. I wanted to be there for Jamie, to guide her through this rough patch, but I also felt the pull of my faith, the need to honor my spiritual commitments. The weight of these conflicting roles settled heavily on my shoulders as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
