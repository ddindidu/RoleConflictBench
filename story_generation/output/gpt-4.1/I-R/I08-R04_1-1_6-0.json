As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip or speaking ill of others, but the group\u2019s curiosity was infectious, and I felt the urge to join in, to not seem distant or self-righteous. At the same time, I was aware that the time for Maghrib prayer was approaching. As the imam, I was expected to lead the prayer at the mosque, but tonight, the congregation was small and another qualified worshipper was present, ready to step in. The group\u2019s laughter grew louder, and someone nudged me, asking for my opinion on Farid\u2019s choices. I felt the weight of their expectations\u2014to be part of the group, to share in their camaraderie. Yet, the responsibility of my role as imam tugged at me, reminding me of the example I was supposed to set, both in speech and in action. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the pull of friendship and the call of duty, uncertain which expectation I should honor."}
