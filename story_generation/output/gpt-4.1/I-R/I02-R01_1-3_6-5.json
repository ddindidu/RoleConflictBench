She was upset that I\u2019d forgotten our dinner plans for Saturday, and I could feel the tension rising between us. As her boyfriend, I knew I needed to call her, talk things through, and reassure her that she mattered more than anything. But just as I was about to dial, my phone buzzed with another message\u2014this one from the church council. There\u2019d been a fire in one of our community member\u2019s homes, and they needed me to organize immediate support and counseling. My heart pounded. As a pastor, I was expected to be there for my congregation, to offer comfort and guidance in their darkest moments. But as a boyfriend, I was supposed to resolve conflicts and be present for Emily. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt torn in two, paralyzed by the knowledge that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
