The code wouldn\u2019t run, and I knew I should email Sister Maria, my mentor, to let her know I was stuck. She always said, \u201cDon\u2019t let problems fester\u2014bring them to me.\u201d But just as I reached for my phone, the convent bell rang. Word spread quickly: the Johnson family\u2019s house had burned down. The sisters were already gathering food and warm clothes, and I was expected to join them. As a nun, I was taught to put others\u2019 needs first, to be present in moments of crisis. My heart ached for the Johnsons, but my mind kept circling back to the project deadline and my mentor\u2019s trust. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the chance to communicate my struggles and risk falling behind. If I stayed, I\u2019d be turning my back on a family in need and the values I vowed to uphold. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each pulling me in a different direction. I stood frozen, torn between duty and devotion, unsure which call to answer first."}
