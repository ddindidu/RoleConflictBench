As an acquaintance, I felt the pressure to keep things light and not intrude too much\u2014after all, we\u2019re not close friends, and I didn\u2019t want to make her uncomfortable or overstep boundaries. But as a Christian, I felt a deep pull to reach out, to show compassion and kindness, just as Jesus would. My mind raced with questions: Should I sit beside her and offer comfort, or would that be too forward? Would a simple \u201cAre you okay?\u201d be enough, or should I do more? I could feel the tension inside me, torn between wanting to respect her space as an acquaintance and the urge to act on my faith\u2019s call to love and care for others. My heart pounded as I stood there, unsure of what to do next."}
