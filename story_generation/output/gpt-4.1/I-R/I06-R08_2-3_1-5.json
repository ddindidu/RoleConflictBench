The deadline was tight\u2014just three days\u2014and I knew how much my mentor valued punctuality and thoroughness. I wanted to prove myself, to show that I was reliable and dedicated. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized it was almost time for Friday prayers. I quickly changed into my abaya and hijab, making sure everything was in place. Dressing modestly was not just a habit; it was a part of my faith, a way to show respect in the prayer hall.\n\nBut as I reached for my bag, my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to bring your laptop for coding practice after prayers.\u201d My mentor had suggested I use any spare moment to work on the assignment. I hesitated, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I bring my laptop into the mosque, risking the distraction and the awkwardness of carrying it in my prayer clothes? Or should I leave it behind, focusing solely on my worship and modesty? The expectations clashed inside me, and I stood frozen at the door, torn between my responsibilities as a mentee and my devotion as a Muslim."}
