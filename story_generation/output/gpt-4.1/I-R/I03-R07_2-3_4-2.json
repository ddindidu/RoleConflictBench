I want to be there, to laugh and hold his hand, to show him he matters. But my other phone buzzes\u2014a reminder from the monastery. The annual festival starts tomorrow, and they need volunteers tonight to set up altars and prepare offerings. It\u2019s a sacred event, one I\u2019ve promised to support, and my teacher\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cOur community relies on each other.\u201d I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My heart aches at the thought of disappointing him, but I also feel guilt at the idea of letting down my sangha. I sit on the edge of my bed, torn, wishing I could split myself in two. The clock ticks on, and I still haven\u2019t replied to either message."}
