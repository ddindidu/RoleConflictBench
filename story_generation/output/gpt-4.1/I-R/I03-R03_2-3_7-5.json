We\u2019d argued again\u2014this time about money, about how I never seemed to have enough time for him, about how I was always distracted. He wanted me to come over, to talk things through, to finally resolve the tension that had been building all week. I knew he expected me to be present, to listen, to fight for us.\n\nBut the convent bell echoed down the hallway, a reminder that I was expected in the chapel. Tonight, of all nights, I had been chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the cathedral\u2014a public event, a great honor, and a responsibility I could not take lightly. The sisters were counting on me to represent our community, to guide them in faith and devotion.\n\nMy heart twisted as I stared at the phone, torn between the world outside and the sacred silence within these walls. I wanted to be both: the understanding girlfriend, the devoted nun. But tonight, I could not be in two places at once."}
