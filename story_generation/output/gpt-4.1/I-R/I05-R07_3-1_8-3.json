The soft chime on my phone is set, a gentle reminder to pause, breathe, and return to the present. But just as I settle onto my cushion, my phone buzzes again\u2014my mentee, Maya, is calling. Her voice trembles as she explains the crisis: the project she\u2019s leading is unraveling, and she\u2019s desperate for guidance. As her mentor, I know how much this moment means for her career. She needs me to listen, to offer advice, to help her grow through this challenge. Yet, as a Buddhist, I\u2019ve promised myself these ten minutes of stillness, a sacred space to cultivate mindfulness and compassion. My mind tugs in two directions: the urge to answer Maya\u2019s call, to be the mentor she needs, and the longing to honor my own practice, to sit in silence and reconnect with my breath. The weight of both expectations presses on my chest, and I find myself suspended between the needs of another and the quiet promise I made to myself."}
