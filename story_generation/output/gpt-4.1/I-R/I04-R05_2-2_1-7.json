It\u2019s my friend, Leah, her name flashing on the screen. I answer, and immediately hear the tremble in her voice. \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now,\u201d she says, her words tumbling out between shaky breaths. She\u2019s had another fight with her partner, and I can hear the pain and confusion in every word. As her friend, I want nothing more than to listen, to offer comfort and reassurance, to be the steady presence she\u2019s always counted on. But as I glance at the clock, my heart pounds. The congregation is gathering, the Torah is ready, and Ethan\u2019s family is anxiously awaiting this milestone. They\u2019re counting on me to lead, to guide, to be fully present for their son\u2019s big day. I feel torn, the weight of both roles pressing in on me, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. My mind races, caught between the needs of my friend and the sacred responsibility awaiting me at the synagogue."}
