I glance down the hall, thinking of Mrs. Goldstein, my elderly neighbor who lives alone. We\u2019ve always looked out for each other\u2014last winter, I shoveled her walkway, and she\u2019s left soup at my door when I was sick. Tonight, I know she\u2019ll be anxious, maybe even scared, and I feel the pull to check in, to make sure she\u2019s safe and has everything she needs.\n\nBut my phone buzzes again, this time with a message from the synagogue. There\u2019s a funeral prayer tonight, and they\u2019re short one person for the minyan. Without me, the prayer can\u2019t happen, and I know how important it is for the grieving family. My community expects me to be there, to uphold this sacred duty.\n\nI stand in my hallway, torn. The storm is coming, and I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart aches with the weight of both responsibilities\u2014my neighbor\u2019s safety and my religious obligation. I pace, wrestling with the knowledge that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
