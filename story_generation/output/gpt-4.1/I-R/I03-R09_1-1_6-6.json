He sounded upset\u2014apparently, he thought I\u2019d agreed to spend Saturday with him, but I\u2019d already planned to go to synagogue for the morning service. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to say. As his girlfriend, I knew I should call him, talk things through, and clear up the misunderstanding before it grew into something bigger. That\u2019s what a good partner does: resolves conflicts, doesn\u2019t let them fester. But as a Jewish woman, I also felt the pull of my community and my faith. Saturday morning services were a routine part of my life, a time to reconnect with tradition and myself. Even though the congregation wouldn\u2019t miss me, I would miss the sense of belonging and peace I always found there. I felt torn, caught between the urge to fix things with Ben and the quiet obligation to show up for my faith. My thumb hovered over the call button, my mind racing with the weight of both expectations."}
