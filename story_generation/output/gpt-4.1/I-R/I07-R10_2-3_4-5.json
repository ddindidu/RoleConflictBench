My inbox was full, and the project deadline loomed. I knew my part was crucial\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish today, Priya\u2019s work would be delayed, and the whole team would suffer. My manager had reminded me twice already: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any setbacks.\u201d The pressure was suffocating.\n\nBut then, as I was reviewing some documents, I stumbled upon something disturbing\u2014a clear sign that someone on our team was manipulating data for personal gain. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma, to act with honesty and integrity, no matter the cost. I felt a deep responsibility to speak up, to stop this harm from spreading.\n\nYet, if I reported it now, I\u2019d lose precious hours, maybe even days, dealing with the fallout. The project would stall, my colleagues would be frustrated, and I\u2019d be letting them down. My mind raced, torn between my duty to my team and my duty to my conscience. I stared at the screen, paralyzed, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
