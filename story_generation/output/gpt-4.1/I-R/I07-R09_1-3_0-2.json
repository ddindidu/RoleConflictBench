Our weekly team meeting was scheduled for Thursday afternoon, the same time I\u2019d promised to help my son practice his Torah portion for his upcoming bar mitzvah. As a colleague, I was expected to be present, contribute ideas, and show my commitment to the team\u2014even if the meeting would be recorded. But as a Jewish parent, I felt a deep responsibility to guide my son, to pass on our traditions and ensure he felt confident and prepared for this milestone. My manager had already commented on the importance of everyone being present, and I didn\u2019t want to seem disengaged. At the same time, my son\u2019s nervous eyes reminded me how much he needed my support. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each pulling me in a different direction. I sat at my desk, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
