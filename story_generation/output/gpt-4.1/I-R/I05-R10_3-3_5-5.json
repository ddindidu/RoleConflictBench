She trusted me, hanging on every word as I explained the importance of accuracy and integrity in our work. But as we reviewed the documents, I noticed something unsettling\u2014a clear sign that someone on the team had manipulated the data. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I am taught to uphold dharma, to act with honesty and courage, especially when others are at risk. The right thing would be to report this wrongdoing immediately, to protect those who might be harmed by these lies. Yet, as a mentor, I worried about the impact on my mentee.
