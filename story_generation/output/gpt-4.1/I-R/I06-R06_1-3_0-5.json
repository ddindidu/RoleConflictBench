The reading wasn\u2019t mandatory, but I knew he expected me to take initiative and show my commitment. The informal deadline was weeks away, but I wanted to impress him, to prove I was serious about my growth. At the same time, my church group chat buzzed with reminders about the upcoming service and the community outreach event this weekend. As a Christian, I was expected to be present, to worship, and to serve alongside my friends. Missing a service or an activity felt like letting down my faith and my community. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I spent my weekend on the readings, I\u2019d miss church and disappoint my fellow believers. But if I went to church, I\u2019d fall behind on the readings and risk seeming uncommitted to my mentor. My heart tugged in both directions, and I could feel the tension building inside me as I tried to figure out what to do."}
