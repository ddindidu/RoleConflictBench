You know this area better than anyone\u2014can you recommend a good place to eat nearby?\u201d he asked, his tone light and expectant. I smiled, ready to help, when I noticed a woman hurrying up the church steps, her face streaked with tears. She looked lost, desperate, and I could sense she needed more than directions or a friendly chat\u2014she needed spiritual comfort, right now.\n\nMark was still waiting, his eyes hopeful, and I could feel the weight of his simple request. At the same time, the woman\u2019s pain pulled at my heart, reminding me of my calling to offer solace and guidance. I stood there, torn, the expectations of friendship and priesthood colliding inside me. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety rising as I tried to figure out how to be both a supportive acquaintance and a compassionate priest in this single, impossible moment."}
