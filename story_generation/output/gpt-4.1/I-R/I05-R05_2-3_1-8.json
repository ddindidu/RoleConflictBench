She was distraught, her voice trembling as she asked if I could officiate the funeral tomorrow. As their rabbi, I knew how much it meant to her family for me to be there, to offer comfort and lead the service.

He\u2019d been struggling for weeks, and I\u2019d promised to be there for his presentation, to give him feedback and support.
