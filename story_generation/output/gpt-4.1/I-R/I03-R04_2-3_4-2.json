He\u2019s been looking forward to it, and so have I\u2014just a few hours to talk, laugh, and feel close before my travel schedule sweeps me away. I promised him I\u2019d be there, and I want to keep that promise. But as I\u2019m getting ready, my phone buzzes. There\u2019s a large gathering at the mosque for a special remembrance, and the usual imam is away. No one else is authorized to lead the prayers. They need me. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. As a girlfriend, I crave that rare, gentle time with Amir, knowing how much it means to us. As an imam, I know the community depends on me, especially tonight. My heart aches with the pull in both directions. I stare at my phone, torn, feeling the expectations of love and duty collide inside me, unsure which path to take."}
