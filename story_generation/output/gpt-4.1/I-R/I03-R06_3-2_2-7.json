The room felt heavy with his grief, and I wanted nothing more than to hold him, to be his anchor as he mourned his father. He needed me\u2014my words, my presence, my unwavering support. But my phone buzzed again, a message from Sarah, a girl from church who\u2019d been struggling since losing her job. She\u2019d reached out, asking if I could come over, just to talk, just to listen. As a Christian, I felt the pull to show her the love and kindness Jesus taught us, to be there for her in her time of need. But how could I leave my boyfriend now, when he was so broken? My heart ached, torn between the man I loved and the call to serve others. I stared at my phone, guilt and helplessness swirling inside me, unsure which need was greater, or which role I was meant to fulfill in this moment."}
