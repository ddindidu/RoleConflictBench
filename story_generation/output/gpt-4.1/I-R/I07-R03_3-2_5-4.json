My manager\u2019s reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t miss this deadline\u2014the client is counting on us.\u201d The pressure was suffocating; this task was the linchpin for the entire project, and everyone was waiting on me. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I felt another pull. Tonight, the sisters were gathering for a special healing service for Sister Agnes, who had grown weaker these past weeks. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to pray and support my community, especially in moments like this. My heart ached with guilt at the thought of missing the service, but the weight of my professional responsibility pressed just as hard. I could almost hear the disappointment in both my manager\u2019s and my Mother Superior\u2019s voices. My hands trembled as I tried to focus, torn between the urgent needs of my workplace and the sacred duty to my sisters. The minutes ticked by, and I sat frozen, caught in the impossible space between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which call to answer."}
