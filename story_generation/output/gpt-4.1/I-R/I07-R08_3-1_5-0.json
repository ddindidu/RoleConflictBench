As a colleague, I knew the task I\u2019d been assigned was crucial\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish it tonight, the whole project would stall, and the client would be left waiting. My team was counting on me, and I could almost feel their expectations pressing on my shoulders. Yet, as the sun dipped below the horizon, the call to Maghrib prayer echoed softly from my phone. The evening stretched ahead, unusually free, and I had promised myself I would finally spend some time reciting and reflecting on the Quran, something I\u2019d neglected for weeks. The thought of reconnecting with my faith filled me with longing and guilt in equal measure. I sat at my desk, torn between the urgent demands of my work and the quiet, persistent call of my faith, feeling the weight of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
