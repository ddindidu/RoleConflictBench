He needed me\u2014needed my arms around him, my words of comfort, my presence. I wanted to be there, to hold his pain with him, to listen and reassure him that he wasn\u2019t alone. But my phone buzzed again. It was my friend from the temple, asking if I could join a video call to discuss the sermon we\u2019d heard last night. She said she was struggling to understand the teachings and hoped I could help her reflect and find clarity. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me. My heart ached for my partner, but I also felt the pull of my spiritual path, the responsibility to support my friend\u2019s practice and deepen my own understanding. I stared at the phone, torn, feeling the tension coil in my chest. I wanted to be everything for everyone, but I could already feel myself stretching thin, unsure which part of me to honor in this moment."}
