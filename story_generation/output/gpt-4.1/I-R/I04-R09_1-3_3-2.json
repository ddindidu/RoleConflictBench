His bar mitzvah is only weeks away, and he\u2019s still stumbling over the Hebrew. I promised myself I\u2019d help him every evening, making sure he\u2019s ready, making sure he feels proud. But now, my friend\u2019s name flashes on the screen, her message urgent: \u201cCan you hop on a video call? I\u2019m totally lost with this furniture and need help before I lose my mind.\u201d She\u2019s always been there for me, and I know she wouldn\u2019t ask unless she really needed it. I glance at my son, his brow furrowed in concentration, waiting for me to guide him through the next verse. My heart twists\u2014my friend needs me, but so does my son. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in, torn between being the friend who shows up and the parent who passes on tradition."}
