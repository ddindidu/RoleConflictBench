My mentor had been clear: \u201cI want to see your approach to this problem before our next meeting.\u201d Three days. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d make him proud, show him I was serious about learning. But as I tried to focus, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee. The regular backup imam was out of town, and everyone expected me to lead the prayers for the next few days. I could picture the congregation, waiting for me, relying on me to guide them in worship. My heart twisted. I wanted to be there for them, to fulfill my duty as imam, but every hour at the mosque meant less time for my assignment. I felt torn\u2014my mentor\u2019s trust on one side, my community\u2019s faith on the other. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I wondered how I could possibly meet them without letting someone down."}
