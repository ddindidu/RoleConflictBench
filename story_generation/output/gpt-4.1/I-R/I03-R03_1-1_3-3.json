I miss you.\u201d My heart flutters, remembering our laughter and the warmth of his hand in mine. We finally have free evenings this week, a rare chance to be together without rushing. I want to say yes, to lose myself in his company, to be the girlfriend he deserves\u2014present, attentive, loving.\n\nBut the chapel bell tolls, echoing through the convent\u2019s stone halls. It\u2019s time for morning prayer, a sacred duty I\u2019ve promised to uphold. The sisters are already gathering, their voices soft and reverent. I feel the weight of my habit, the expectations of devotion and discipline pressing on my shoulders. My place is with them, in prayer and service, not out in the world.\n\nI stand in the hallway, torn between two lives. Alex\u2019s message glows with hope, while the chapel calls with quiet certainty. My heart aches as I wrestle with the impossible choice, caught between love and faith, between the world outside and the vows I\u2019ve made within."}
