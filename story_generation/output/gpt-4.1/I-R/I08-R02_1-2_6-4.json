The group\u2019s tone shifted, voices lowering, words edged with judgment. As an acquaintance, I\u2019ve always tried to avoid gossip, believing it only breeds misunderstanding. I felt the familiar discomfort rise in my chest, wanting to steer the conversation away, but not wanting to seem self-righteous or distant.\n\nLater that afternoon, I prepared for my appointment as a priest. A community member, struggling with guilt and self-doubt, was coming to seek guidance. I knew the importance of listening without judgment, offering compassion and understanding. My role demanded I be a source of comfort, someone who could help them find peace and forgiveness.\n\nBut as I waited, the earlier conversation echoed in my mind. How could I counsel someone about grace and acceptance when I\u2019d just sat silently as others tore down a colleague? The expectations of my two roles pressed in on me\u2014one urging me to avoid negativity, the other calling me to be a beacon of empathy. I felt torn, uncertain which voice to follow as the door opened and my visitor entered."}
