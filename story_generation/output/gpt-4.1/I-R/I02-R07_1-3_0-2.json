She tried to smile, but I could see the day had worn her down. As her boyfriend, I wanted to be there for her, to listen and offer comfort, maybe make her tea and sit with her until she felt lighter. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the monastery\u2019s annual festival preparations started at dawn. As a Buddhist, I\u2019d promised to help set up, a commitment I made months ago. The community counted on me, and I knew how important this ritual was for everyone\u2019s spiritual well-being. I felt torn\u2014Mia needed me tonight, but so did my sangha.
