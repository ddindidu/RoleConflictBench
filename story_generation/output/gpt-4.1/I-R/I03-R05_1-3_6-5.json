He\u2019s upset that I forgot our brunch plans for Sunday, and I can feel the tension in his words. As his girlfriend, I know I should call him, talk it through, and smooth things over before the misunderstanding grows. That\u2019s what a good partner does\u2014resolves conflicts, listens, reassures. But my calendar is glaring at me: in fifteen minutes, I\u2019m supposed to meet Miriam, my conversion student, for her last study session before her Beit Din. She\u2019s nervous, and I promised I\u2019d help her feel ready, answer every question, and guide her through the final steps. As her rabbi, I can\u2019t let her down now, not when she\u2019s come so far. My heart pounds as I weigh the phone in my hand, torn between the person I love and the person I\u2019m meant to guide. Both need me, right now, in different ways. I close my eyes, feeling the pressure build, wishing I could split myself in two."}
