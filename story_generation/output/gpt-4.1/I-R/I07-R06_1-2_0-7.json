As a colleague, I knew I was expected to attend, contribute, and show my commitment to the team. Even though the meeting would be recorded, I felt the unspoken pressure to be present, to show I was engaged and reliable. But just as I was about to log in, I received a message from Sarah, a friend from church. She was struggling, her words heavy with sadness and fear. As a Christian, I felt a deep responsibility to respond with love and kindness, to be there for her in her moment of need, just as Jesus taught. My heart ached as I weighed the expectations\u2014my team counting on my participation, and Sarah needing someone to listen and care. I stared at the meeting invite and Sarah\u2019s message, torn between being a dependable colleague and a compassionate Christian, feeling the tension rise within me as I wrestled with what to do next."}
