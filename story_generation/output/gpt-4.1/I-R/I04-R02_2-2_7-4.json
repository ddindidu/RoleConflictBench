His reply was curt, his words edged with hurt. He\u2019d misunderstood my earlier text, and I could feel the distance growing between us. I knew I should call him right away, clear the air before the misunderstanding deepened. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate, resolve things before they fester. But as I reached for my phone, the church bell chimed softly. In ten minutes, Mrs. Evans would arrive, seeking counsel for the burden she\u2019d carried for months. As her priest, I was her confidant, her guide. She needed my full attention, my compassion, my presence. My heart twisted. Mark needed me now, but so did Mrs. Evans. I could picture Mark\u2019s hurt face, hear Mrs. Evans\u2019 trembling voice. Both expected me to be there for them, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The weight of their needs pressed on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the friend who needed understanding and the parishioner who needed hope."}
