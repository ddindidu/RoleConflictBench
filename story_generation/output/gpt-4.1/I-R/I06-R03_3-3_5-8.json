As a mentee, I knew I should reach out to my mentor about the escalating conflict with my teammates\u2014our arguments had grown so tense that our deliverable was now at risk. My mentor always emphasized open communication, and I could almost hear her voice urging me to be honest about my struggles. But as a nun, I was also expected to devote myself to spiritual study and reflection, especially now that the Mother Superior had entrusted me with leading daily reflections for the upcoming retreat. The responsibility weighed heavily on me; the community looked to me for guidance and inspiration. I felt torn, pulled between the urgent demands of my mentee role and the sacred duty of my vocation. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, wondering if I should call my mentor or set it aside to prepare for the retreat. The silence in the room pressed in, thick with the tension of my divided loyalties."}
