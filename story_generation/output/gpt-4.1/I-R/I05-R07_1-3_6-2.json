She confessed she was overwhelmed, her deadlines slipping through her fingers. As her mentor, I felt the urge to help her map out a plan, maybe even offer to meet early tomorrow to guide her through her priorities. That\u2019s what I was supposed to do\u2014be present, encourage her growth, and help her find her footing.\n\nBut as she spoke, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the monastery\u2019s annual festival preparations began at dawn. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be there, to help set up the altar, to chant, to serve the community that had given me so much peace. The festival was sacred, a time when everyone\u2019s presence mattered.\n\nI felt the tension coil in my chest. If I met Maya in the morning, I\u2019d miss the festival\u2019s opening rituals and let down my fellow practitioners. If I went to the monastery, I\u2019d leave Maya to struggle alone, betraying my commitment as her mentor. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat in silence, torn between two worlds that both felt like home."}
