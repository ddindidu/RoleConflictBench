She was already at the airport, asking if I could keep an eye on her apartment and accept a package while she was away. With the planned power outage, she was worried about her fridge and the delivery of her son\u2019s medication. I\u2019d always tried to be a good neighbor\u2014reliable, present, someone people could count on in small but important ways.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. In less than an hour, I was supposed to lead the children\u2019s Torah class at the synagogue. It was the weekly lesson, and parents expected me to be there, teaching their children not just stories, but the very heart of our tradition. I could already picture the eager faces, the parents trusting me to guide their children.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing on my shoulders. If I left for the synagogue, I might miss the delivery and let down Mrs. Feldman. If I stayed, I\u2019d disappoint the children and their families, and perhaps even fail in my duty as their rabbi. My mind raced, caught between the quiet hallway outside my door and the sacred halls of the synagogue, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
