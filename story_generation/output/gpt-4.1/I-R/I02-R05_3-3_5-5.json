Can we meet tonight for one last study session?\u201d My heart tightens. Tonight is the only time she can meet before her Beit Din, and I know how much this means to her. I promised to guide her, to be present for every step of her journey. But as I look up, I see my girlfriend packing her suitcase, folding shirts with trembling hands. It\u2019s our last weekend together before she leaves for months. We planned a quiet evening\u2014her favorite dinner, a walk by the river, just us. She catches my eye and smiles, but I see the sadness she\u2019s trying to hide. I feel pulled in two directions: the rabbi who must not let a student down, and the boyfriend who wants to hold on to every last moment. My chest aches with the weight of both promises, and I wonder how I can possibly choose."}
