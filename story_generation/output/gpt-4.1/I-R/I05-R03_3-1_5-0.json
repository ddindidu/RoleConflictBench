As a mentor, I was expected to guide Sister Maria through the intricate process of preparing the convent\u2019s financial report\u2014a task where a single error could jeopardize our funding. She waited anxiously, clutching her notes, her eyes searching mine for reassurance and wisdom. I knew she needed my full attention, my patience, and every ounce of experience I could offer.\n\nYet, the bells tolled for the food drive, echoing through the halls. As a nun, I was expected to join my sisters in the kitchen, preparing meals for the homeless. The community depended on our presence, our hands, and our hearts. The thought of not being there, of letting down those who counted on us for a warm meal and a kind word, gnawed at me.\n\nI felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions. The responsibility to guide Maria weighed as heavily as the call to serve. My heart raced as I tried to quiet the guilt rising within me, knowing that no matter what I chose, I would be leaving something\u2014and someone\u2014behind."}
