It was Samir, my closest friend, his voice tight with panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. Can you check and bring it to the airport? My flight\u2019s in two hours.\u201d I glanced at the envelope of cash on my desk\u2014the money I\u2019d carefully set aside, resisting every temptation, every unexpected expense, just so I could finally fulfill my religious duty this year. My friends were already booking their tickets, and I knew if I dipped into my savings now, I might not be able to go with them.\n\nBut Samir was always there for me, and I knew he\u2019d do the same if our roles were reversed. The expectation to help a friend in crisis weighed heavily on me, but so did the sacred obligation I felt as a Muslim to perform Hajj. My heart pounded as I stared at the envelope, torn between loyalty to my friend and my longing to answer the call to pilgrimage."}
