My girlfriend, Sarah, had asked if she could come with me today, saying she wanted to understand more about my faith. I could tell she was a bit on edge, her shoulders tense, her words clipped. She\u2019d had a rough day at work, and I wanted nothing more than to comfort her, to be the supportive boyfriend she needed. But as we approached the entrance, I noticed her outfit\u2014a short-sleeved blouse and fitted jeans\u2014wasn\u2019t in line with the modest dress expected in the mosque. \n\nI felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As a Muslim, I knew the importance of upholding the mosque\u2019s guidelines, not just for myself but for anyone entering. But as her boyfriend, I wanted to ease her stress, not add to it by pointing out her clothes. I could see the uncertainty in her eyes, and I felt torn, caught between the urge to protect her feelings and the responsibility to honor my faith\u2019s expectations. My mind raced, searching for the right words, but none came."}
