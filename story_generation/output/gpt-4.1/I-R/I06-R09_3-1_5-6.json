The tension with my teammates had reached a boiling point, and our project deadline was slipping through my fingers. I knew I was supposed to reach out, to be honest about the challenges, but tonight was also Shabbat. My family expected me at synagogue, and so did my community. It was a routine service, not a holiday, but I\u2019d always been taught that showing up mattered, that being present was part of who I am. \n\nMy mentor had emphasized open communication, especially when things got tough. I could almost hear her voice: \u201cDon\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late.\u201d But if I called her now, I\u2019d miss the service, and I\u2019d feel the weight of letting down my family and my faith. If I went to synagogue, I\u2019d be ignoring my responsibility as a mentee, risking the project and my relationship with my mentor. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling pulled apart by the two worlds I belonged to."}
