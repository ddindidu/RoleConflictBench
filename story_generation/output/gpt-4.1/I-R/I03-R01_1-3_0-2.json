He hadn\u2019t said much, but I could feel the tension in his shoulders, the way his fingers drummed restlessly on his knee. As his girlfriend, I wanted to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and warmth. I reached for his hand, but my phone buzzed insistently on the coffee table. It was a message from a member of my congregation\u2014someone in deep crisis, asking if I could talk right away. Their words hinted at desperation, at a decision that could change everything for them. As a pastor, I knew my guidance could be crucial, that I was expected to respond with compassion and wisdom, no matter the hour. My heart twisted. I looked at my partner, needing me in a quiet, unspoken way, and then at my phone, where someone else\u2019s pain waited for me. The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to be fully there. I hesitated, torn, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds that needed me at the same time."}
