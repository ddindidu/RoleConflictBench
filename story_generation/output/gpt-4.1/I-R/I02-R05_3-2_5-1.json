It\u2019s Friday afternoon, and the apartment is filled with the scent of her favorite coffee. She sits across from me, her suitcase half-packed, her eyes searching mine for reassurance. This is our last weekend together before she leaves for months, and I promised her we\u2019d make every moment count. But my phone buzzes again\u2014a reminder about the Shabbat service. As the rabbi, I\u2019m expected to prepare a meaningful sermon and lead the congregation. They rely on me for guidance, especially now, with so many seeking comfort and hope. I feel the weight of their expectations pressing against the promise I made to her. She reaches for my hand, and I see the hope in her face, the need for closeness before the distance grows. My mind races, torn between the sacred duty to my community and the sacredness of these fleeting hours with her. The sun is setting soon, and I know I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart aches as I wrestle with the impossible choice, caught between love and responsibility, knowing that whatever I decide, something precious will be left behind."}
