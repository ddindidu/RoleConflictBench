His voice was raw, trembling with grief, and I could almost feel his tears through the line. He needed me\u2014needed my words, my comfort, my presence, even if only through a call. My heart ached to stay with him, to listen, to hold his pain with my own. But the chapel bell tolled, echoing down the stone hallway, a summons I could not ignore. Morning prayers were about to begin, and as a nun, I was expected to be there, present in body and spirit, joining my sisters in devotion. The weight of my habit felt heavier than ever. I glanced at the clock, torn between the sacred duty that shaped my days and the love that pulled me beyond these walls. My partner\u2019s sobs grew softer, and I whispered that I was here, but I could not say for how long. The bell rang again, insistent. My heart pounded as I sat frozen, caught between two worlds, unable to move toward either without betraying the other."}
