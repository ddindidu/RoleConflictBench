As a neighbor, I know the unspoken rule: a quick hello, a polite smile, and then we each go about our day. That\u2019s what I did\u2014just a nod and a gentle \u201cGood morning.\u201d But as I turned away, I caught a glimpse of her eyes, red and puffy, her shoulders slumped. Something was clearly wrong. \n\nAs a Christian, I\u2019m taught to show love and kindness, to reach out when someone is hurting. The teachings of Jesus echo in my mind: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d But I hesitate. What if she wants privacy? What if I\u2019m intruding? The neighborly thing is to respect her space, but my faith urges me to offer comfort, maybe even a listening ear. I stand in the corridor, torn between the polite distance expected of a neighbor and the compassionate action my faith demands, my heart pounding as I wrestle with what to do next."}
