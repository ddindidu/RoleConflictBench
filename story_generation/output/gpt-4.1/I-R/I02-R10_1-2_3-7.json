We finally have time!\u201d My heart leapt. We\u2019d both been so busy, and I missed our long talks and laughter. Thursday was perfect\u2014except it was also the night of my cousin\u2019s puja, a family ceremony I was expected to attend. My parents had already reminded me to be home early, to help set up and wear my kurta. They\u2019d be disappointed if I skipped it, especially since family gatherings are so important in our tradition.\n\nBut Priya was excited, already suggesting places we could go. I could almost hear her voice, hopeful and happy. I wanted to be with her, to show her she mattered. Yet, I also felt the weight of my family\u2019s expectations, the importance of honoring our customs. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of Priya\u2019s company and the duty I felt toward my family and faith. The two worlds pulled at me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both at once. I stared at my phone, unable to type a reply, caught in the tension of choosing between love and tradition."}
