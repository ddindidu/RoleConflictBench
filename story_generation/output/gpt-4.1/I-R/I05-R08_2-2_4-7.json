My mentees were counting on me to guide them through the final steps before their big project deadline. I\u2019d promised them a thorough, structured session\u2014one that could make all the difference in their confidence and performance. As I reviewed my notes, my phone buzzed with a message from my closest friend: \u201cWe\u2019re booking our Hajj tickets tonight. Are you in?\u201d My heart skipped. I\u2019d been saving for years, dreaming of this pilgrimage, and now the opportunity was real. But the session I\u2019d planned was on the same day as the group\u2019s departure. My mentees needed me, but so did my faith. The weight of both expectations pressed on me\u2014my responsibility to share knowledge and support, and my longing to fulfill a sacred duty. I stared at the screen, torn, feeling the pull of both worlds, unsure which path to follow."}
