My laptop pinged\u2014a message from our department head, marked urgent. The leadership needed my confirmation on a project detail for an external partner, and the reply was expected within the hour. I glanced at the clock. In five minutes, I was due in the main chapel for morning prayers, a sacred commitment I had never missed. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: my colleagues relied on my promptness, my reliability; my sisters in faith expected my presence, my devotion. The email glared at me, cursor blinking, while the chapel bells grew louder, echoing the rhythm of my own anxiety. I felt torn, caught between the world of deadlines and the world of devotion, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
