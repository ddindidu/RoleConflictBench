He was upset that I hadn\u2019t told him sooner about my church\u2019s weekend retreat. We\u2019d planned to spend Saturday together, just the two of us, but I\u2019d forgotten the church had scheduled a special service and community clean-up. As his girlfriend, I knew he expected me to talk things through, to resolve misunderstandings quickly and make time for us. But as a Christian, I felt the weight of my commitment to attend church and serve with my community. My pastor always said our presence mattered, that we should be there for each other, especially during special events. Mark\u2019s message blinked on my screen, asking if I could skip church just this once. My heart twisted. I wanted to make things right with him, to show him he mattered, but I also didn\u2019t want to let down my church family or my faith. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I sat there, torn, not knowing which part of me I should listen to."}
