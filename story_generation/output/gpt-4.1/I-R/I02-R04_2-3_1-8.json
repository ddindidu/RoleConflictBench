She needed me\u2014my arms, my words, my undivided attention. I wanted nothing more than to hold her, to reassure her that she was more than her boss\u2019s opinion. My phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque: a brother had just arrived, devastated by the sudden loss of his mother, asking for me specifically. As the imam, I knew my presence was expected, my words a lifeline in his grief. I looked at Aisha, her hand clutching mine, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. My heart ached for her, but my conscience pulled me toward the mosque. I could not be in two places at once, and both needed me now, in ways only I could provide. The silence between us grew heavy as I stared at my phone, torn between love and duty, unable to move."}
