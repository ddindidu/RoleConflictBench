The readings weren\u2019t urgent, but I knew she expected me to be prepared, to show initiative and respect for her guidance. I wanted to impress her, to prove I was worthy of her time. Yet, as I turned a page, the bell for evening prayers echoed through the halls. Tonight was different\u2014I had been chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the city cathedral, a rare honor for someone so new to the convent. The sisters were counting on me to represent our community with grace and devotion. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles. If I focused on the readings, I might not be spiritually centered for the vigil. If I devoted myself to prayer, I\u2019d fall behind in my mentor\u2019s eyes. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat frozen, torn between the world of study and the world of faith, unsure which path to follow first."}
