He\u2019d barely spoken since the call about his brother. As his girlfriend, I wanted to hold him, to let him grieve without words, to simply be there. But tonight, at the community gathering, someone asked about hope in hard times, and I slipped into my other role\u2014pastor. I shared the story of Job, speaking of faith and endurance, my voice steady and practiced. Mark\u2019s gaze flickered to me, a flash of pain crossing his face. I saw it\u2014the expectation to comfort him as his partner, to just listen, clashing with the expectation to guide others spiritually, to offer answers. My heart twisted. Was I helping, or was I making it worse? The room buzzed with quiet conversation, but inside me, a storm raged. I wanted to be everything for him, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the call to lead. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which part of me should speak next."}
