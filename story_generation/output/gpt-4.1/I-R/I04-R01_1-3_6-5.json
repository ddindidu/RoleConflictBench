It was Sam, my oldest friend, asking if we were still meeting at the caf\u00e9 or if plans had changed. He sounded confused, and I knew from past experience that if I didn\u2019t clarify things right away, he\u2019d feel hurt or left out. At the same moment, my assistant rushed over, her face pale. \u201cPastor, the Johnson family just lost their home in the fire. They\u2019re waiting for you in the hall. They need you now.\u201d I could hear the muffled sobs from down the corridor. My heart twisted. As a friend, I wanted to reassure Sam, to keep our trust strong by responding immediately. As a pastor, I was expected to be present, to comfort and guide those in crisis. Both roles demanded my full attention, right now. I stood frozen, phone in hand, torn between the urgent needs of my friend and my congregation, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
