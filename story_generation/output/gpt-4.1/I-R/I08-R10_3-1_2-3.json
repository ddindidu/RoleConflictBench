My instinct as an acquaintance was to approach her, offer a gentle word, maybe just listen\u2014after all, being friendly and approachable is what people expect. But just then, I saw another coworker quietly slip ahead in the line, ignoring the others who had been waiting. As a Hindu, I\u2019ve always been taught to uphold dharma, to act ethically and speak up when something isn\u2019t right, even in small matters like this. My mind raced: should I comfort Priya, fulfilling my role as a kind acquaintance, or should I address the unfairness in the line, staying true to my moral principles? I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, each demanding my attention, each expecting something different from me. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and for a moment, I just stood there, uncertain, caught between what I should do and what I must do."}
