My mentee, Sarah, waited anxiously for my advice\u2014her job offer deadline was tonight, and she needed my guidance to make a decision that could shape her entire future. I had promised her my full attention, to walk her through every detail, every possible outcome. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. The evening service for the most sacred holiday of our faith was about to begin. The sanctuary would soon fill with hundreds of expectant faces, all looking to me for spiritual leadership, for the prayers and rituals that only I could lead. I could not be in two places at once.

I felt torn, guilt rising no matter which way I turned, as I wrestled with the impossible choice before me."}
