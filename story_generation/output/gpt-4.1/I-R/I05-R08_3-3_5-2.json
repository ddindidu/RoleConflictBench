As a mentor, I promised my team I\u2019d walk them through the final steps of a project that could make or break their careers. They\u2019re counting on my experience, my steady hand, and I know a single misstep could cost them dearly. My phone buzzes\u2014a reminder from the mosque. The community study circle meets in an hour, and tonight\u2019s discussion centers on Quranic verses I haven\u2019t yet read. As a Muslim, I\u2019m expected not just to attend, but to recite and reflect, to show my commitment to faith and learning. My mind races, torn between the urgent needs of my mentees and the spiritual nourishment I crave. I feel the tension in my chest, guilt gnawing at me from both sides. I want to be present for my team, but I also long for the peace and connection that comes from immersing myself in the Quran. The clock ticks on, and I\u2019m left wrestling with the impossible choice between guiding others and guiding myself."}
