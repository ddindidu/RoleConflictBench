The tension in my chest was almost unbearable\u2014my teammates\u2019 arguments had escalated, and our project was falling apart. I knew I was supposed to reach out, to be honest about the mess, but my mind kept drifting to the clock. In less than an hour, I was supposed to teach the weekly adult education class at the synagogue. It wasn\u2019t mandatory, but I\u2019d promised the regulars I\u2019d be there, and I knew how much they looked forward to our discussions. \n\nMy mentor always said transparency was key, that I should never hide when things got tough. But as a rabbi, I felt the weight of my community\u2019s expectations\u2014showing up, being present, offering wisdom. If I called my mentor now, I\u2019d be late to class, maybe even miss it. If I waited, I\u2019d be letting my mentor down, risking the project and my own growth. My stomach twisted as I tried to decide which responsibility mattered more, feeling the pull of both roles, and the impossibility of being fully present for either."}
