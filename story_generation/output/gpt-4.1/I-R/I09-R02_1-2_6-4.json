As a neighbor, I know Mrs. Kim next door is expecting an important package. She\u2019s mentioned how often she misses deliveries, and I promised I\u2019d keep an eye out if I was home. Today, I am\u2014at least physically. But as a priest, I also have a responsibility to my congregation. At the same time the delivery is due, I have a counseling appointment with Mark, a young man wrestling with a crisis of faith. He\u2019s been waiting weeks for this slot, and I know how much he needs someone to listen. My phone buzzes with a reminder from Mrs. Kim, and I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both promises. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the expectations press in: to be a good neighbor, to be a faithful priest. My mind races, torn between the simple act of kindness next door and the deeper call to guide a soul in need. The tension knots in my chest as I try to decide which role I must let down, even if just for today."}
