I\u2019m really hurt by what you said earlier.\u201d My heart sinks. I replay my words, realizing how careless I\u2019d been. As her friend, I know I should call her right now, apologize, and explain myself before the misunderstanding grows. She deserves that honesty and care from me.\n\nBut tonight is also the community Quran study circle. I promised myself I\u2019d be prepared, but I haven\u2019t read the verses yet. As a Muslim, I feel the weight of that commitment\u2014showing up unprepared feels disrespectful, and I want to reflect deeply, not just skim the words. The group expects me to contribute thoughtfully, and I don\u2019t want to let them down.\n\nI stare at my phone, torn. If I call Aisha, I\u2019ll miss the quiet time I need to read and reflect. If I focus on the Quran now, I risk letting my friend\u2019s pain fester. Both roles matter so much to me, but right now, their demands pull me in opposite directions, and I can\u2019t see how to honor both."}
