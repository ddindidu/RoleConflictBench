She smiled warmly, and I returned the gesture, exchanging a quick hello as we always did. I knew she appreciated these small moments of friendliness; it was part of being a good neighbor, keeping the atmosphere in our building pleasant and welcoming. But as I reached my door, I glanced at my watch and remembered the weekly study slot I had planned with my kids. We were supposed to sit together and talk about Jewish traditions, something I felt deeply responsible for as a parent. The lesson could be shifted, but I worried about losing the rhythm, the sense of importance I wanted to instill in them. I stood there, torn between the easy comfort of neighborly politeness and the weightier, more personal duty of teaching my children about our heritage. The corridor felt suddenly narrow, as if the walls themselves pressed in with the pressure of these two roles, each demanding something different from me at the same moment."}
