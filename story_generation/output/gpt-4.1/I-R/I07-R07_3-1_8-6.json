The subject line read: \u201cNeed confirmation for tomorrow\u2019s meeting with our partner.\u201d I knew the expectation\u2014quick, clear communication. I glanced at the clock. It was nearly time for my daily spiritual study, a commitment I\u2019d made to myself as a practicing Buddhist. Just then, my friend from the temple messaged, \u201cCan we talk about the sermon? I really need your thoughts.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My team counted on me to keep things moving, to be reliable and responsive. But my Buddhist practice asked for presence, reflection, and compassion, especially for a friend seeking guidance. My mind raced, torn between the pinging demands of work and the quiet pull of my spiritual path. I stared at my phone, heart pounding, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
