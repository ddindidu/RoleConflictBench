As an acquaintance, I felt the urge to approach her gently, offer a comforting word, and just be a friendly presence. I wanted to be casual, not intrusive, and let her know I was there if she needed to talk. But as I took a step closer, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a parishioner asking if we could schedule a time to talk about some spiritual concerns. As a priest, I knew I was expected to provide guidance and be available for those who sought counsel, even if it was just a tentative inquiry. I felt torn, standing there in the cool afternoon air, caught between the immediate need to be a supportive acquaintance for Anna and the ongoing responsibility to my parishioner. My mind raced with questions: Should I sit with Anna and risk missing the chance to respond promptly to my parishioner? Or should I prioritize my priestly duties and reach out to schedule the chat, possibly leaving Anna alone in her distress? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, unsure which expectation to fulfill first."}
