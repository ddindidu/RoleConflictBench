The topic was forgiveness and stewardship\u2014how we honor God with our resources and our relationships. But my mind kept drifting back to the argument I\u2019d had with Mark last night. We\u2019d fought about money again, voices raised, both of us frustrated and tired. As his girlfriend, I knew I should reach out, try to resolve things, but I felt raw and defensive, unsure how to bridge the gap this time.\n\nYet as a pastor, I was expected to stand before my congregation and teach them about grace, about making wise choices and seeking reconciliation. How could I preach about forgiveness when I hadn\u2019t even texted Mark back? The words I\u2019d written for my sermon felt hollow, almost hypocritical. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one voice urging me to be a loving partner, the other demanding I be a spiritual guide. My heart ached with the weight of both roles, and I stared at the blinking cursor, paralyzed, not knowing which expectation to meet first."}
