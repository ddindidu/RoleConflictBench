I had a small question about a term my mentor used in our last meeting, and she always emphasized the importance of reaching out whenever I was unsure, no matter how minor the issue seemed. I pulled out my phone to send her a quick message, but then I caught my reflection in the glass door. My sleeves had slipped up, revealing more of my arms than I was comfortable with, and I realized I hadn\u2019t adjusted my scarf properly in my rush. As a Muslim, I knew I should enter the prayer hall dressed modestly, fully covered and presentable for Friday prayers. But my mentor expected prompt communication, and I worried she\u2019d think I was ignoring her advice if I waited until after the service. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the urge to fulfill my responsibility as a mentee and my commitment to my faith."}
