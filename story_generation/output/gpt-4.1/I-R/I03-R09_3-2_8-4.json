My heart pounded with the weight of his words\u2014he wasn\u2019t sure if we should stay together. I wanted to fix things, to talk it out, to show him I cared enough to fight for us. But my stomach growled, reminding me we hadn\u2019t eaten since morning. We were miles from anywhere, and the only food nearby was a tiny vendor I\u2019d spotted earlier, the one with the faded kosher certificate in the window. I knew Ben didn\u2019t care about kosher, and he\u2019d want to grab something quick from the gas station instead. But for me, keeping kosher wasn\u2019t just a rule\u2014it was a part of who I am, a connection to my family and faith. I could feel his impatience, the expectation that I\u2019d let it slide just this once, for the sake of peace. But I also felt the pull of my own boundaries, the quiet voice inside that said I couldn\u2019t ignore this part of myself. My hands trembled as I weighed what mattered more: mending us, or staying true to me."}
