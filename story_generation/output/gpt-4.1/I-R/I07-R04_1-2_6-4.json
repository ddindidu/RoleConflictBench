It was from a colleague, marked \u201cinformational,\u201d with a note: \u201cNo immediate action required.\u201d Still, I knew the unspoken rule\u2014respond within a few hours, show you\u2019re engaged, be a good team player. I glanced at the clock. In less than an hour, I was expected at the mosque, where I was the sole imam for today\u2019s Friday sermon. The topic had been announced all week; people would be gathering, waiting for my words, expecting guidance and inspiration. My mind raced between the two worlds\u2014my colleagues counting on my reliability, my community counting on my presence and preparation. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, the urge to quickly reply to the email warring with the need to center myself for the Khutbah. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the demands of my work and my calling, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both my full attention at the same time."}
