The HOA inspection is tomorrow, and I know anything blocking the exit could get us all in trouble. As a neighbor, I\u2019m expected to be considerate, maybe remind them gently or even move the items myself. But as I stand there, I feel the beads of my mala in my pocket. I haven\u2019t had time for my full morning puja, so I quietly repeat my mantra, hoping for calm. My faith teaches me to be patient and non-confrontational, to avoid causing distress. Yet, the pressure of the inspection and the responsibility to the building weigh on me. Should I disturb my neighbor\u2019s peace for the sake of the rules, or should I let it go and risk everyone\u2019s frustration? The words of my mantra echo in my mind, but so does the expectation to be a good neighbor. I stand in the hallway, torn between my roles, unsure which path to take."}
