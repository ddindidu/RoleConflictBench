It was from my manager, marked urgent, asking me to confirm details for an external partner by the end of the evening. I knew how important this was\u2014our team had been working for weeks to secure this partnership, and leadership expected quick, reliable responses from me. At the same time, my church community counted on my presence. I was scheduled to help set up for the service, and I knew my absence would be noticed. I could already imagine the gentle disappointment in my pastor\u2019s eyes if I didn\u2019t show up, and the subtle letdown from my colleagues if I delayed my reply. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between my commitment to my faith and my responsibility to my team. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, each demanding my time and loyalty, and I wondered how I could possibly honor both without letting someone down."}
