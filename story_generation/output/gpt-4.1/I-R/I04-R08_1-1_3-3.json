The door was closed, and I felt completely at ease, knowing I was dressed comfortably and modestly enough for home. Suddenly, my phone buzzed. It was Sara, my close friend, sounding frantic in her text. She\u2019d just started assembling her new bookshelf and was completely lost. \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? I really need your help!\u201d she pleaded.\n\nAs her friend, I knew she counted on me, especially in moments like this. I wanted to be there for her, to guide her through the confusing instructions and calm her nerves. But as a Muslim, I was also aware that video calling in my current attire\u2014shorts and a t-shirt\u2014wasn\u2019t appropriate, even with a female friend, since I try to maintain my standards of modesty. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. Should I ask her to wait while I change, or would that seem like I was letting her down when she needed me most? My heart pounded as I weighed my loyalty to my friend against my commitment to my faith, caught in the tension of two worlds."}
