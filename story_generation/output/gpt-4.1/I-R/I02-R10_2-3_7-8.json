My girlfriend sat beside me, arms crossed, her silence heavy. We\u2019d argued again this morning\u2014money, always money. She wanted us to split expenses differently, and I felt torn between fairness and tradition. As her boyfriend, I knew I should resolve this, talk it through, make peace before resentment grew. But as a Hindu, today was about devotion. My family expected me to be present, to chant, to offer flowers and prayers, to show respect for the gods and my elders. The festival was sacred, and I was supposed to be joyful, focused, and grateful. Instead, my mind spun with our unresolved fight. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one part of me desperate to fix things with her, the other bound by duty to my faith and family. The temple bells grew louder as we approached, and my heart pounded, caught between the demands of love and tradition, unsure which voice to answer first."}
