The colors and sounds pulled at something deep within me, reminding me of my family\u2019s traditions and the expectation that I should join in, even if just for a moment, to honor my heritage. But as I lingered, my phone buzzed with a message from a group of acquaintances gathered at a caf\u00e9 just around the corner. When I arrived, the conversation had already turned to our mutual colleague\u2019s recent decisions at work. I could feel the group\u2019s eyes on me, waiting for my opinion, expecting me to join in the critique. As an acquaintance, I knew I should avoid gossiping or speaking ill of others, but the pressure to fit in was strong. At the same time, the distant sounds of the festival reminded me of my other role, the one that called for participation and celebration, not judgment. I sat there, torn between the urge to slip away to the festival and the unspoken demand to stay and contribute to the conversation, my mind wrestling with the weight of both expectations."}
