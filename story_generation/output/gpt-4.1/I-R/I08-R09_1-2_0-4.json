We\u2019d only chatted briefly before, but he smiled and waved, clearly expecting a friendly exchange. I smiled back, trying to seem relaxed, but my mind was elsewhere. It was nearly lunchtime, and I\u2019d already scoped out the area\u2014only one small vendor nearby was kosher-certified, and I knew from experience that the line could get long and the food could run out quickly. \n\nAs Mark approached, I felt the pressure to stop and chat, maybe even accept his invitation to grab lunch together. That\u2019s what a friendly acquaintance would do, after all. But I couldn\u2019t just eat anywhere; keeping kosher wasn\u2019t something I could set aside, even for the sake of being sociable.
