The team meeting is in ten minutes\u2014a routine catch-up, but my manager expects everyone to participate, to show we\u2019re engaged. I know it\u2019ll be recorded, but there\u2019s always that unspoken pressure to be present, to contribute in real time. At the same moment, my mind is racing with unfinished thoughts for the High Holiday sermon. The congregation is counting on me; this isn\u2019t just any Shabbat, but a service where every word matters, where people seek comfort and inspiration. I can almost hear their voices, see their faces, feel the weight of their expectations. My colleagues expect reliability, my congregation expects spiritual leadership. I sit at my desk, torn, the meeting link open on one screen, my sermon notes on the other. My hands tremble as I try to focus, but the demands of both worlds pull me in opposite directions, and I feel the tension rising, knowing I can\u2019t be fully present for both."}
