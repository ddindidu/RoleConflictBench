Just us.\u201d My heart fluttered. We\u2019d both been so busy, and finally, we had a stretch of evenings free. I imagined us laughing over pasta, his hand in mine, the world fading away. But as I started to reply, another message appeared\u2014this one from Sarah, a member of my congregation. \u201cCould we talk tomorrow night? I\u2019m really struggling.\u201d I could almost hear the tremor in her voice, the weight she carried. As a pastor, I knew how much she needed someone to listen, to offer comfort and guidance. But as Mark\u2019s girlfriend, I longed for that rare, uninterrupted time together. My mind spun with guilt and longing, torn between the warmth of his embrace and the responsibility I felt for Sarah\u2019s pain. Both needed me, both deserved my presence. I stared at the screen, my fingers hovering, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which promise to keep."}
