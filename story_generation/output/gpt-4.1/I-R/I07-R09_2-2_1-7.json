The team meeting was set for Friday afternoon, the same time as Shabbat services. My manager had emphasized how crucial this meeting was\u2014project updates, new assignments, things that wouldn\u2019t be recapped later. Missing it meant falling behind, maybe even letting my team down. But this Friday, I wasn\u2019t just attending synagogue; I was scheduled to chant a Torah portion. The rabbi and my community were counting on me. I\u2019d practiced for weeks, and my family was proud. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My colleagues expected me to be present, engaged, a reliable part of the team. My faith and community expected me to honor my commitment, to show up and lead. I could feel the tension twisting inside me, the fear of disappointing someone no matter what I chose. I sat at my desk, torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
