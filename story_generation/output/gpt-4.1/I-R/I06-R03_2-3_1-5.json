My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cI want to see your finished code sample before our next meeting.\u201d Three days. I knew how important it was to prove myself, to show I could handle the responsibility and learn quickly. But as I stared at the screen, the bell for evening prayers rang through the convent halls. I was not just a mentee\u2014I was a nun, and tonight I had been chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the city cathedral, a rare honor and a duty I could not refuse. The sisters were counting on me to represent our community with grace and devotion. My heart pounded as I glanced between the lines of unfinished code and my habit laid out for the vigil. The expectations pressed in from both sides: the mentor\u2019s trust, the convent\u2019s faith. I felt torn, anxiety rising as I tried to imagine how I could possibly meet both demands, knowing that to fully honor one meant risking disappointment in the other."}
