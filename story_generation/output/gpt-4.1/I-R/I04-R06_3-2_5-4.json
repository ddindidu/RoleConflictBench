His voice trembled as he explained his car had broken down on the highway, miles from home. \u201cCan you come get me? I don\u2019t know who else to call,\u201d he pleaded. As his friend, I knew he counted on me, especially in moments like this. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. Tomorrow was Sunday, and I had promised myself\u2014and my church community\u2014that I would be there for the early morning service. I hadn\u2019t missed a week in months, and I knew how much it meant to my faith and to the people who expected me to show up, to worship, to serve. The weight of both roles pressed on me. Mark\u2019s need was urgent, but so was my commitment to my faith. I sat on the edge of my bed, phone in hand, torn between the desperate voice of my friend and the quiet, steady call of my beliefs."}
