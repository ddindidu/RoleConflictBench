It was almost sunset, and I hadn\u2019t yet offered my daily prayers\u2014a ritual that grounds me, a promise I make to myself and my faith. Just as I rounded the corner, I saw Priya, a colleague I barely knew, coming toward me. She smiled, expecting the usual friendly nod or a quick chat, the kind of small gesture that keeps work relationships smooth and pleasant. But every second I spent here meant another moment lost from my evening ritual, and I could feel the anxiety rising in my chest. I wanted to be warm and approachable, to not seem rude or distant, but I also felt the pull of my spiritual commitment, the need to honor my tradition before the day slipped away. My heart pounded as I slowed my steps, caught between the gentle expectation of friendliness and the sacred call of my faith, unsure which part of myself to honor in that fleeting moment."}
