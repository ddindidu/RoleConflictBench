My elderly neighbor, Mrs. Rahman, lived alone just down the hall. As her neighbor, I felt responsible to check on her, maybe bring her some candles or offer to stay nearby in case the power went out. I knew she\u2019d be anxious tonight. Just as I reached for my coat, a young man burst into the mosque, his eyes red and voice trembling. He had just lost his father and needed guidance, comfort\u2014he needed his imam. My heart twisted. As an imam, I am expected to be present, to listen, to offer solace in moments of despair. But as a neighbor, I couldn\u2019t ignore the thought of Mrs. Rahman, possibly frightened and alone as the storm approached. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each urgent in its own way. I stood in the entryway, torn, the storm outside now matched by the turmoil within me."}
