Feels like forever.\u201d My heart aches a little; we\u2019ve barely seen each other lately, and tonight is our only open evening before I leave for a week-long conference. I promised him we\u2019d have a quiet dinner, just us, no distractions. But as I set the table, my phone rings again\u2014this time, it\u2019s the mother of the bar mitzvah boy. She\u2019s frantic. The cantor is sick, and she\u2019s begging me to step in, to lead the ceremony that\u2019s been planned for months. I hear the desperation in her voice, the weight of her family\u2019s expectations, the importance of this milestone. My mind races. I want to be the supportive girlfriend, to keep my promise, but I also know my role as rabbi means being there for my community, especially in moments like this. I feel the tension coil in my chest, torn between love and duty, knowing that whatever I choose, someone will be disappointed."}
