She was on the verge of accepting a job offer that would launch her career, but it meant leaving behind her ailing mother. As her mentor, I knew my responsibility was to provide clear, structured guidance\u2014lay out the pros and cons, help her see the long-term benefits, and encourage her to seize the opportunity. But as a Christian, I felt the weight of another calling: to show love and compassion, to remind her that sometimes, being present for those we love is more important than any career move. The expectations pressed in on me from both sides\u2014one demanding I be pragmatic and focused, the other urging me to be gentle and empathetic. My mind raced, torn between the professional advice I was supposed to give and the deeper, spiritual encouragement I felt she needed. I could feel my heart pounding as I opened my mouth, uncertain which role would shape the words that came next."}
