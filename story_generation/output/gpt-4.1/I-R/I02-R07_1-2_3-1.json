We finally have time!\u201d My heart lifts. We\u2019ve both been so busy, and I know how much she values these moments\u2014just us, no distractions. I want to say yes immediately, to make her feel cherished. But then I remember the temple\u2019s memorial service tonight. As a practicing Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to attend, to support the community and honor those who\u2019ve passed. The monks have mentioned how important it is for everyone to be present, especially for ceremonies like this. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. Mia\u2019s voice in my mind, hopeful and excited; the gentle, insistent call of the temple, reminding me of my commitment. I want to be the boyfriend who shows up, who makes her feel special. I want to be the Buddhist who honors tradition and community. My chest tightens as I stare at the calendar, torn between two promises, wishing I could be in both places at once."}
