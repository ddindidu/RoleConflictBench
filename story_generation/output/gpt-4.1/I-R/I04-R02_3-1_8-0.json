The text he sent was brief but heavy: \u201cI need some space.\u201d Guilt gnawed at me. As a friend, I knew I should call him immediately, apologize, and try to mend what I\u2019d broken. That\u2019s what friends do: they don\u2019t let misunderstandings fester.\n\nBut the church bell chimed, echoing through the empty halls. In ten minutes, I was supposed to lead the daily prayer service. It wasn\u2019t mandatory, but the congregation expected me to be there, to guide them, to be a steady presence. I could already picture the small group gathering, waiting for me to open the service with calm assurance.\n\nMy phone felt heavy in my hand. If I called Mark now, I\u2019d be late\u2014or miss the service entirely. If I went to the chapel, I\u2019d be leaving my friend in pain, possibly making things worse. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both at once. I stood frozen, torn between the altar and the phone, unsure which duty should come first."}
