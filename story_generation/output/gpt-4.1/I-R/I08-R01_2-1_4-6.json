He looked tired, and I could tell he was hoping for help. As an acquaintance, I felt the familiar tug of obligation\u2014I should offer to help him move those boxes, even if it\u2019s just for an hour or two. Before I could respond, someone else in the group asked about the story I\u2019d shared last Sunday at church. Suddenly, all eyes were on me, expecting me to elaborate, to offer some spiritual insight or guidance. As a pastor, I knew I should seize this moment to teach, to share something meaningful that might touch their hearts. But Mark\u2019s hopeful glance lingered, and I felt torn. If I focused on the group, I\u2019d be neglecting a simple act of kindness for someone who needed it. If I helped Mark, I\u2019d miss the chance to fulfill my pastoral duty in that moment. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself caught between two roles, unsure which path to take."}
