It was Sam, my closest friend, his voice tight with panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. I\u2019m almost at the airport. Can you check and bring it if it\u2019s there? Please, I\u2019ll miss my flight otherwise.\u201d I could hear the desperation in his voice, and I knew how important this trip was for him.\n\nBut tonight was also the night I\u2019d promised to help at the shelter\u2019s dinner service, a commitment I made because I wanted to live out my faith\u2014showing love and kindness to those who needed it most. The shelter was short-staffed, and I knew the guests counted on us for a warm meal and a listening ear. \n\nMy heart pounded as I stood in my hallway, keys in hand, torn between rushing to help my friend in his emergency and keeping my promise to serve at the shelter. Both roles demanded my presence, both were about love and support, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. I felt the weight of letting someone down, no matter what I chose."}
