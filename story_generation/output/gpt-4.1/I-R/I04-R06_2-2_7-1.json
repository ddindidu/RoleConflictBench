My friend had just replied to my text, clearly hurt by something I\u2019d said. I hadn\u2019t meant it that way at all, and I knew I should call right now to clear things up. That\u2019s what a good friend does\u2014communicates openly, doesn\u2019t let misunderstandings fester. But as I reached for my phone, I remembered the conversation I\u2019d overheard earlier at work. My friend had confessed to something unethical, something that went against everything I believed as a Christian. I\u2019d been wrestling with whether to bring it up, to gently challenge them, or to just let it go for the sake of our friendship. Now, with this misunderstanding, the pressure doubled. If I called, I\u2019d have to choose: do I focus on fixing the friendship, or do I bring up the ethical issue, risking more hurt? My roles as a friend and as a Christian felt like they were pulling me in opposite directions, and I sat there, phone in hand, torn and uncertain."}
