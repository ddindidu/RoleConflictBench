During a casual check-in, I noticed Priya, one of my brightest mentees, seemed distracted and overwhelmed. She confessed she was struggling with time management, and I assured her that together we\u2019d find a way to balance her workload. But later that day, I overheard a conversation that made my heart pound\u2014Priya was involved in a scheme to falsify project reports, pressured by her team lead. As a Hindu, my dharma compels me to act with integrity and stand against wrongdoing, especially when it harms others. Yet, as a mentor, I\u2019m expected to support Priya\u2019s growth, to guide rather than punish, to help her learn from mistakes rather than expose her. The weight of these expectations presses on me. Should I confront her directly, risking her trust? Should I report the wrongdoing, knowing it could ruin her career? My mind races, torn between my duty to uphold moral principles and my responsibility to nurture and protect my mentee."}
