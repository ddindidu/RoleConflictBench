As her mentor, I felt the weight of responsibility to help her succeed, to encourage her confidence and growth. I reviewed her resume, prepared feedback, and rehearsed possible questions in my mind. But as the clock neared seven, I glanced at my home altar. The brass lamp sat unlit, the incense untouched. As a Hindu, I am expected to perform my daily rituals\u2014lighting the lamp, offering prayers, and chanting mantras\u2014before starting the day. It grounds me, connects me to my faith, and brings peace to my home.\n\nPriya messaged that she would arrive early, anxious and needing reassurance. I felt torn. If I delayed my prayers, I would neglect a sacred duty and feel unsettled all day. If I excused myself to perform my rituals, I risked making Priya feel less important, perhaps even unprepared for her opportunity. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, uncertain which path to take."}
