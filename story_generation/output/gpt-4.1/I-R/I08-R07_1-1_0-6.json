My mind was still turning over the teachings, eager to find a quiet spot to reflect and perhaps jot down some notes before the insights faded. Just then, I saw Mark, an acquaintance from work, coming toward me. He smiled, clearly expecting a friendly greeting, maybe even a bit of small talk. I felt the familiar tug of social obligation\u2014be warm, approachable, make him feel seen. But my phone buzzed with a message from my Buddhist friend, asking if I had time to discuss the sermon. I knew she valued deep, focused conversation, and I wanted to honor that commitment too. I felt my chest tighten, caught between the expectation to be present and friendly in the hallway, and the pull to honor my spiritual practice and my friend\u2019s request. I hesitated, unsure which role to step into, feeling the weight of both pressing in on me."}
