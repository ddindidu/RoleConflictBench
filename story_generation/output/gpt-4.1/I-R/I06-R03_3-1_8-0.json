She\u2019d squeezed me in before her flight, making it clear how precious this hour was. I felt honored, but also anxious\u2014her guidance was invaluable, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second of her time. Yet, from the hallway, I could hear the other sisters gathering supplies for the food drive. Today was our monthly outreach, and as a nun, I was expected to be present, hands busy with sorting and distributing meals. Sister Agnes\u2019s gentle voice floated in, asking if I could help carry boxes. My heart twisted. I wanted to honor my commitment to the community, to be there for those who needed us. But I also couldn\u2019t let down my mentor, who had gone out of her way for me.
