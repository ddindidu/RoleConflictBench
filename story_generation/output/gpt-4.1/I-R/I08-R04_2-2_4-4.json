He\u2019s moving to a new apartment and asked if I could help him carry some boxes. He sounded desperate\u2014his brother canceled last minute, and he doesn\u2019t have anyone else to turn to. As an acquaintance, I feel a responsibility to help. I know how hard it is to move alone, and I don\u2019t want to let him down.\n\nBut today is Friday, and I am the imam scheduled to deliver the Khutbah. The community has already announced my topic, and I know many people are looking forward to it. There\u2019s no one else to fill in; if I don\u2019t show up, the congregation will be left without a sermon. The weight of both expectations presses on me. I want to be there for Ahmed, but I also can\u2019t abandon my duty to the community. My mind races, torn between the immediate need of a friend and the collective trust of my congregation. I sit in silence, feeling the tension build inside me, unsure which path to take."}
