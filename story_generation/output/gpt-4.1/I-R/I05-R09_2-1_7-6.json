She was on the cusp of a major promotion, and tonight was our final prep session before her big interview. As her mentor, I felt a deep responsibility to help her succeed, to be present and attentive, to encourage her to reach her full potential. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. It was nearly time for the Thursday evening service at synagogue\u2014a commitment I\u2019d made not just to my community, but to my faith and to myself. The service wasn\u2019t a special one, and I knew the minyan would likely be complete without me, but the expectation to attend was still there, woven into the fabric of my identity. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, the desire to be the mentor Sarah needed and the Jew I aspired to be. My phone buzzed with a reminder for the service, and I stared at it, torn, the competing demands echoing in my mind."}
