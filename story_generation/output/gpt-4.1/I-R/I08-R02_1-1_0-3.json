As an acquaintance, I felt the usual tug to smile, nod, and keep things light\u2014just a friendly hello, nothing more. But as I passed him, he slowed, hesitated, and then asked, \u201cFather, do you have a moment? I\u2019ve been thinking about talking to someone\u2026 maybe you, if you\u2019re free sometime.\u201d His voice was tentative, almost apologetic. Instantly, my priestly instincts kicked in; I knew I should offer him my time, my ear, my guidance. Yet, I also sensed he didn\u2019t want to make things awkward between us, to blur the line between casual friendliness and the deeper, more vulnerable space of spiritual counsel. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014should I keep things light, respecting the boundaries of our acquaintance, or open the door to something more, as his priest? My mind raced, caught between the easy comfort of a hallway greeting and the solemn responsibility of my calling."}
