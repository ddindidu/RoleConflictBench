Just moments ago, I\u2019d seen the message from Priya\u2014her words stung with hurt, and I realized my careless joke had cut deeper than I\u2019d ever intended. As her friend, I knew I should call her right away, apologize, and talk things through before the misunderstanding grew. But as I reached for my phone, I caught sight of the small brass lamp on my altar, waiting to be lit. The sun was dipping below the horizon; it was time for my daily prayers, a sacred ritual I\u2019d promised myself never to neglect. My family expected me to keep this tradition alive, and I felt the weight of that responsibility. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent need to mend my friendship and the quiet, spiritual duty calling me from the altar. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me, as I tried to decide which part of myself I would have to let down, even if just for a moment."}
