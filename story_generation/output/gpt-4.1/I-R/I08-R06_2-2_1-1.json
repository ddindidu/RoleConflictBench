As an acquaintance, I felt the familiar tug to be warm and welcoming, to draw her into the conversation and help her feel at ease. I smiled, introduced myself, and asked gentle questions, watching her slowly relax. Then, someone nearby started telling a story, laced with crude jokes and gossip about another person from our church. Laughter rippled through the group, and I saw the new girl glance at me, uncertain, maybe looking for a cue on how to react.\n\nInside, I felt the tension coil. As a Christian, I knew I shouldn\u2019t join in or encourage talk that tears others down. But as an acquaintance, I worried that if I spoke up or withdrew, I\u2019d seem cold or judgmental, making the new girl feel even more out of place. My mind raced, torn between the urge to protect my values and the desire to be friendly and approachable. I could feel my heart pounding, caught between two worlds, unsure which path to take."}
