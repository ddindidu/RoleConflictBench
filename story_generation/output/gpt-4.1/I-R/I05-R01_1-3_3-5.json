She looked eager, notebook in hand, and I could see how much she valued these moments. As her mentor, I felt a responsibility to share what I\u2019d learned, to help her grow. I started to answer, but my phone buzzed urgently. A message from the church board: a family in our congregation had just lost their home in a fire. They needed immediate support\u2014someone to organize shelter, food, and comfort. As a pastor, I was expected to be there, to lead and care for my community in crisis. I glanced at Sarah, her hopeful eyes waiting for guidance, while my mind raced with the needs of the devastated family. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one expecting my calm wisdom, the other my swift compassion. My heart pounded as I stood between them, torn by the demands of mentorship and ministry, unsure which call to answer first."}
