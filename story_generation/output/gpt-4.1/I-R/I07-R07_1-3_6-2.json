Today was the monastery\u2019s annual festival, a day I looked forward to all year. As a practicing Buddhist, I felt a deep responsibility to help with the preparations, to be present for the rituals that connected me to my community and my practice. I dressed quickly, ready to head out, when my phone buzzed. It was an email from a colleague\u2014just an update, nothing urgent, but I knew our team valued prompt replies, even for informational messages. I hesitated, thumb hovering over the screen. If I responded now, I\u2019d be late to the monastery, letting down the monks and fellow volunteers who counted on my help. But if I waited until after the festival, I\u2019d risk seeming unresponsive at work, possibly disappointing my team and undermining the trust we\u2019d built. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood in the doorway, torn between the quiet call of my spiritual community and the steady hum of professional responsibility."}
