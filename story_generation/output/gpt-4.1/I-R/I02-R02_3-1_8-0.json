Across from me, my girlfriend\u2019s eyes were red, her voice trembling as she asked, \u201cAre we even right for each other anymore?\u201d The argument had spiraled out of control, and now everything felt fragile, as if one wrong word could shatter us completely. I knew, as her boyfriend, I should stay, listen, and help us find a way through this. She needed me to be present, to show her that our relationship mattered more than anything else.\n\nBut as a priest, I was expected to be at the chapel, guiding my community in prayer, offering them the comfort and stability they relied on. They counted on me to be there, to keep the rhythm of faith alive, even if the service was technically optional. My heart pounded as I looked between the clock and her tear-streaked face, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
