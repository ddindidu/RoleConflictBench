He\u2019d just told me about the harsh feedback from his boss, and I could feel the weight of his disappointment. As his girlfriend, I wanted to wrap my arms around him, listen, and reassure him that he was more than his job. But my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mrs. Lee, a member of my congregation. Her daughter had texted me earlier, saying her mom was having a rough day and could use a call. As a pastor, I knew how much those small gestures mattered, how a few kind words could lift someone\u2019s spirit. I looked at Mark, then at my phone, feeling the pull from both sides. My heart ached, torn between being the partner he needed and the pastor my community expected. I could feel the tension rising in my chest, the pressure to be present for both, but knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
