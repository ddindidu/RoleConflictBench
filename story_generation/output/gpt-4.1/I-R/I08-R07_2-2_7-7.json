She\u2019s really slipping.\u201d As an acquaintance, I knew the polite thing was to nod or at least not challenge him, but I also remembered my own resolve to avoid gossiping or speaking ill of others. The words felt heavy in the air, and I could sense Mark waiting for my reaction, expecting camaraderie in his criticism.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the weekly Buddhist study circle was meeting tonight. We were supposed to discuss a new chapter on right speech and mindful communication\u2014teachings I\u2019d been looking forward to reflecting on. I felt the pull of that commitment, the desire to immerse myself in spiritual study, to deepen my understanding and practice.\n\nBut here I was, caught between the expectations of being a supportive acquaintance and the principles I aspired to as a Buddhist. My mind raced, torn between the urge to maintain social harmony and the call to live by the values I was about to discuss with my sangha."}
