My mentor had managed to squeeze in a session with me just before catching a long flight, a rare opportunity I couldn\u2019t take for granted. I knew how precious her time was, and I wanted to show my respect by being fully present, attentive, and grateful. Yet, as I listened to her advice, my phone buzzed with reminders: the main weekly service at the church was about to begin. As the priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, to be there for my community, especially today when so many would gather seeking comfort and guidance. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my mentor\u2019s expectant gaze, the congregation\u2019s trust. I felt torn, my mind racing between the sacred duty I owed my community and the rare chance to learn from someone I deeply admired. The minutes ticked by, and I sat frozen, caught between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each deserving it."}
