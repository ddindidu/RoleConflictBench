The deadline was clear\u2014three days to finish, and I knew how much my mentor valued diligence and follow-through. I wanted to prove myself, to show I was worthy of the time and guidance I\u2019d been given. But as I sat at my desk, my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah. She\u2019d been struggling lately, her texts growing more desperate, and now she was asking if I could come over. I remembered the words from last Sunday\u2019s sermon\u2014love your neighbor, be present for those in need. My heart ached with the weight of both expectations. If I left my work, I\u2019d fall behind and disappoint my mentor. If I ignored Sarah, I\u2019d be turning away from the compassion my faith called me to show. The pressure built inside me, a tug-of-war between my commitment to growth and my calling to kindness, and I sat frozen, torn between two worlds that both demanded all of me."}
