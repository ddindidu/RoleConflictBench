In ten minutes, I was expected in the chapel to lead the evening prayer\u2014a daily ritual, not mandatory, but cherished by the handful who attended. As a priest, I knew my presence brought comfort, a sense of continuity and peace to those who came seeking solace. Yet, just as I was gathering my things, a young mentee from the university knocked on my door, her eyes anxious. She needed advice about a job offer\u2014nothing urgent, she insisted, but she looked so uncertain, so in need of reassurance. As her mentor, I felt the weight of her trust, the expectation that I would help her navigate these small but significant crossroads. I could see the hope in her face, the silent plea for guidance. My mind raced, torn between the quiet sanctuary waiting for me and the young woman before me. Both roles called to me, each with its own quiet urgency, and I felt the familiar ache of being pulled in two directions, uncertain which need should come first."}
