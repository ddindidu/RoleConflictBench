It was Mark, my old college friend. \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m drowning in screws and planks over here. These instructions make no sense.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014just two hours left before I needed to send my sermon draft to the church secretary. My mind raced. As a friend, I wanted to be there for Mark, especially since he\u2019d just moved and didn\u2019t know many people in town. He\u2019d helped me through rough patches before; I owed him. But as a pastor, I felt the weight of responsibility to my congregation, to offer them guidance and clarity on Sunday. I could hear the urgency in Mark\u2019s voice, but I also felt the pressure of unfinished work and the expectations of my role. My heart tugged in two directions, and I sat there, phone in hand, torn between the friend who needed me now and the congregation counting on me later."}
