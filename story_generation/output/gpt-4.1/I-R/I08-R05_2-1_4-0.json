He was moving to a new apartment and asked if I could help him carry a few boxes this afternoon. As an acquaintance, I felt the familiar tug of obligation\u2014after all, isn\u2019t it right to offer a hand when someone asks? But as I glanced at my calendar, a different weight pressed on me. Shabbat was approaching, and I hadn\u2019t even started brainstorming topics for my upcoming sermon. The congregation expects thoughtful, relevant messages, and I know how much preparation it takes to deliver something meaningful. My mind raced: if I help David, I\u2019ll lose precious hours I\u2019d set aside for study and reflection. If I decline, I risk seeming cold or uncaring, failing the simple kindness expected of a friend. The two roles pulled at me from opposite directions, and I sat there, phone in hand, heart pounding, caught between the demands of compassion and the responsibilities of leadership, unsure which expectation I could afford to disappoint."}
