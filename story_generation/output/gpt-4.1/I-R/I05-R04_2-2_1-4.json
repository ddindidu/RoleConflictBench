My phone buzzed with a message from Ahmed, my mentee, who was struggling with a critical project deadline. He needed my guidance, and I had promised to review his work and offer feedback before his final submission. As his mentor, I knew how much he depended on my support, especially during these high-pressure moments. At the same time, my mind kept drifting to the Khutbah I was scheduled to deliver in just a few hours. The community had already announced my topic, and I was the only imam listed for this week. People would be gathering, expecting words of wisdom and spiritual guidance. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my mentee\u2019s anxious plea for help, and the congregation\u2019s anticipation for the sermon. My heart pounded as I stared at my unfinished notes and Ahmed\u2019s draft, torn between the urgent needs of one and the collective expectations of many."}
