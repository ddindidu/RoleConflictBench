The deadline for the client delivery was tomorrow, and my part was the last piece before the team could send it off. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check in on her tonight. As a colleague, I knew the team was counting on me; any delay would ripple out, affecting everyone\u2019s work and our reputation with the client. But as a pastor, I felt a tug of responsibility, a quiet voice reminding me that Sarah might need someone to listen, even if just for a few minutes. My inbox pinged with a reminder from my manager, and at the same time, I saw Sarah\u2019s name light up on my phone again. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to be fully there. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the urgent and the important, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
