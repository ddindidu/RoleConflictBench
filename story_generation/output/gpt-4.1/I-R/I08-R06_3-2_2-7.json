As an acquaintance, I felt the pressure to keep things light and not intrude too much\u2014after all, we\u2019re not close friends, and I didn\u2019t want to make her uncomfortable or overstep boundaries. But as a Christian, I felt a deep pull to reach out, to offer comfort and kindness, just as Jesus would have done. My mind raced with questions: Would she appreciate my concern, or would she see it as prying? Should I sit beside her and offer a prayer, or would that be too much? The expectations of being a friendly, non-intrusive acquaintance clashed with my desire to show genuine Christian compassion. My heart ached with the tension, torn between wanting to respect her space and feeling called to be a source of comfort in her pain."}
