As a mentee, I knew I was supposed to reach out to my mentor whenever I hit a snag, no matter how small. Today, I stumbled over a term in the reading\u2014nothing urgent, but I could hear my mentor\u2019s voice in my head: \u201cDon\u2019t let questions pile up.\u201d I wanted to be diligent, to show I respected her guidance.\n\nBut the church bell chimed outside my window, reminding me of my other role. In less than an hour, I was expected to lead the children\u2019s religious education class. The parents trusted me to be prepared, to greet their kids with warmth and wisdom. I still needed to set up the classroom, review the lesson, and pray for guidance.\n\nMy mind tugged in two directions. If I emailed my mentor now, I\u2019d be late setting up for the children. If I waited, I\u2019d be ignoring the expectation to communicate promptly. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on my chest, each demanding my full attention, neither willing to wait."}
