Just before class, an old friend\u2014an acquaintance from the community\u2014had confided in me, sharing a sensitive piece of information about another congregant. I could see how easily this knowledge, if spoken aloud, could damage someone\u2019s reputation. As an acquaintance, I felt a strong urge to keep silent, to avoid even the hint of gossip, as I always tried to do in my personal life.\n\nBut as a rabbi, I was about to step into a room full of children, ready to teach them about the importance of honesty, community, and the laws of speech\u2014lashon hara. I knew that the lesson plan for today included a discussion about real-life scenarios, and the example I\u2019d just been given was so relevant, so immediate. Should I use it, anonymized, to make the lesson more powerful? Or would even that cross a line, betraying the trust of my acquaintance? My heart pounded as I stood at the threshold, torn between my roles, the expectations of each pressing in on me from both sides."}
