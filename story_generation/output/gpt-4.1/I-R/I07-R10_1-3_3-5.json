My task for the week was straightforward, with plenty of buffer time, and my colleagues assured me they could move ahead without my part for now. I should have felt at ease, but my mind was elsewhere. Earlier, I had overheard a conversation between two managers discussing a plan to cover up a mistake that would unfairly harm a junior employee. As a Hindu, I was raised to value dharma\u2014righteousness and truth. My conscience screamed at me to act, to speak up or at least report what I\u2019d heard. But as a colleague, I was expected to focus on my work, meet deadlines, and not stir up trouble, especially when my own tasks weren\u2019t urgent. The weight of these conflicting expectations pressed on my chest. Should I risk disrupting the team and possibly my own standing, or should I stay silent and stick to my assigned work? My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between my duty as a colleague and my deeper moral responsibility."}
