Across the room, I noticed a new face\u2014a young woman, shifting nervously, eyes darting around. As an acquaintance, I knew I should approach her, offer a warm smile, and help her feel welcome. That\u2019s what people expected of me: to be friendly, approachable, and open. But my mind kept drifting to the convent, where the monthly food drive was about to begin. The sisters would be counting on me to help prepare meals and distribute them to those in need. I could almost hear Sister Agnes\u2019s gentle reminder about our commitment to serve the poor. The weight of both expectations pressed on me\u2014one pulling me toward compassion for a single soul, the other toward my duty to many. My hands fidgeted with my rosary as I stood, caught between the urge to reach out and the responsibility to serve, my heart aching with the impossibility of being in two places at once."}
