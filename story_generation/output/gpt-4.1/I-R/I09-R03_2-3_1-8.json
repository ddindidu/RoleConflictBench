Wanting to be friendly, I baked a simple lemon cake, hoping to share it if I met anyone in the hallway. As I wrapped the cake, I remembered the Mother Superior\u2019s request: I was to lead daily reflections for the retreat, a responsibility that demanded hours of preparation and deep spiritual focus. The expectation was clear\u2014my time should be devoted to prayer and study, not socializing. Yet, as I heard footsteps outside my door, I felt the weight of neighborly kindness tug at me. Should I open the door, introduce myself, and offer the cake, or retreat into my room to prepare for the reflections? The warmth of community and the solemnity of my calling pulled me in opposite directions, and I stood frozen, cake in hand, heart torn between two worlds."}
