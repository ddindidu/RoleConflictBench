It was the last weekend before Alex left for his new job overseas, and he wanted us to spend every moment together. He\u2019d planned a special dinner, just the two of us, and I knew how much it meant to him. But as we walked through the city, I noticed an elderly woman struggling with her groceries at the corner. My church always taught me to show love and kindness, to help those in need, just as Jesus would. I felt the familiar tug in my chest\u2014should I stop and help her, risking cutting into our precious time, or should I keep walking, focusing on Alex and the memories we needed to make before he left? Alex squeezed my hand, eager to get to the restaurant, but the woman\u2019s quiet struggle echoed in my mind. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which expectation I should honor in this fleeting moment."}
