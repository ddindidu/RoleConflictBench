My boyfriend, eyes red and voice trembling, clung to my hand. He had just lost his father, and I was the only one he wanted near. He needed me, needed my comfort, and I wanted nothing more than to hold him, to be his anchor. But as the call to prayer echoed, I realized I wasn\u2019t dressed for the main prayer hall. My sleeves were short, my hair uncovered. I knew the expectations\u2014modesty, respect for the sacred space. I could feel the stares of others, the silent judgment. My boyfriend\u2019s grip tightened, silently begging me not to leave him alone in his grief. I felt torn, the weight of my faith pressing against the pull of my love. I wanted to be there for him, but I also wanted to honor my beliefs. My mind raced, caught between the warmth of his need and the cool certainty of my faith, unsure which part of myself I could bear to disappoint."}
