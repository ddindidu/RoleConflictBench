Laughter and sharp comments bounced around the table, and I felt the familiar pressure to join in, to nod or add a remark, to be part of the group. As an acquaintance, I knew I should avoid gossiping or speaking negatively about others, but the urge to fit in tugged at me. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from Sister Layla, a long-time congregant. She asked if I could meet her soon, saying she was overwhelmed by family stress and needed guidance. As an imam, I felt the weight of her trust and the responsibility to offer her support and counsel. The voices around me grew louder, and I felt torn.
