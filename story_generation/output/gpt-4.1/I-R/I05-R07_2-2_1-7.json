She\u2019s hit a wall with her project, and her words are laced with anxiety. I know she\u2019s been counting on my guidance, and our regular check-ins have become her anchor. I glance at the clock\u2014our weekly Buddhist study circle meets in an hour. I haven\u2019t read the chapter yet, and I promised myself I\u2019d be more present, more engaged in my spiritual practice. The group expects me to contribute thoughtfully, to reflect deeply, and I crave that quiet space for myself. But Maya\u2019s voice in my mind is urgent, and I feel the weight of her trust. My heart tugs in two directions: the responsibility to guide her through this storm, and the longing to honor my commitment to the sangha and my own spiritual growth. I sit at my desk, torn, the demands of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to choose tonight."}
