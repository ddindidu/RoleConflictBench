We\u2019d argued three times this week about money\u2014her frustration sharp, my answers clumsy. As her boyfriend, I knew I should call her, listen, and try to resolve things before the tension grew. But my mind kept drifting to the stack of Buddhist texts on my desk. My teacher had asked me to summarize the Four Noble Truths for tomorrow\u2019s temple session, a responsibility I couldn\u2019t take lightly. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: Mia needed me to be present and patient, to help us find peace; my sangha expected me to reflect deeply, to honor the teachings with clarity and care. My heart tugged in two directions, guilt and anxiety swirling as I stared at the unread messages and the unopened books, unsure which path to take first."}
