My mentee, Sarah, waited anxiously for my advice on a job offer that could change her life. She needed me to walk her through the pros and cons, to help her see the path ahead with clarity. I could see the hope in her eyes, the trust she placed in my guidance. But as I glanced at my watch, my heart tightened. The main weekly service was about to begin, and as the priest, my presence was not just expected\u2014it was essential. The congregation would be gathering, looking to me for spiritual leadership, for the comfort and ritual that anchored their week. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the sacred duty to my community and the personal responsibility to my mentee. My mind raced, torn between the call to serve many and the call to serve one. I could not be in two places at once, and the expectations of both roles pulled me in opposite directions, leaving me paralyzed in the middle, uncertain which path to take."}
