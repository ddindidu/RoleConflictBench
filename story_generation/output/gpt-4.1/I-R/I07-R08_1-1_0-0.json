As a colleague, I knew I was expected to join, share updates, and show my engagement. Even though the meeting would be recorded, I felt a subtle pressure to be present, to show I was a reliable part of the team. But tonight was different. For the first time in weeks, my evening was free\u2014no chores, no errands, just a quiet space. I had planned to recite and reflect on the Quran, something I\u2019d been longing for after days of rushing through prayers. The thought of missing this peaceful time tugged at me. I wanted to honor my faith, to give myself fully to the words and their meaning. Yet, the familiar ping of the meeting reminder pulled me back. My mind spun with questions: Would my absence be noticed? Was it selfish to prioritize my spiritual needs? I sat at my desk, torn between the expectations of my colleagues and the quiet call of my faith, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
