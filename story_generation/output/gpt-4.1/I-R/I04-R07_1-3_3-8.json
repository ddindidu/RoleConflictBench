My teacher had asked me to present a summary, and I felt the weight of responsibility to honor the Dharma and my sangha. Just as I was finally finding clarity, my phone buzzed. It was Sam, my oldest friend. \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m losing my mind with these furniture instructions.\u201d I could hear the frustration in his message, and I knew he wouldn\u2019t ask unless he really needed help. As a friend, I wanted to be there for him, to offer support when he was struggling. But as a Buddhist, I felt the pull of my commitment to spiritual study, the need to prepare mindfully and not let my teacher or the community down. My heart raced as I stared at the phone, torn between the urge to answer and the need to stay present with my practice."}
