It was an email from a colleague, marked as informational, with a note at the end: \u201cNo immediate action needed.\u201d Still, I knew the unspoken rule\u2014respond within a few hours, even if just to acknowledge receipt. I started typing a quick reply, but my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been quiet lately, and her text was brief: \u201cDo you have a moment to talk?\u201d I could sense the heaviness behind her words. As a pastor, I felt the pull to offer comfort, to be present for her in her time of need. But the pressure from work was real too; I didn\u2019t want to seem unresponsive or unreliable to my team. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between the expectation to be a prompt, dependable colleague and the deeper call to provide spiritual support. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat there, caught in the tension, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
