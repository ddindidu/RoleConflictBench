It was marked as informational, with a note saying, \u201cNo immediate action required.\u201d Still, I knew the unspoken rule: respond within a reasonable time, show you\u2019re engaged, be a good team player. As I started to type a quick acknowledgment, I glanced up and saw another coworker quietly slip ahead in the line for the office printer. It was subtle, almost unnoticeable, but I caught it. My upbringing as a Hindu taught me to value honesty and fairness, to speak up when something isn\u2019t right, even in small matters. But I hesitated. If I responded to the email now, I\u2019d miss the chance to address the line-cutting. If I acted on the ethical dilemma, I\u2019d delay my response and risk seeming inattentive. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of being a reliable colleague and staying true to my moral principles. I could feel the tension building inside me, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
