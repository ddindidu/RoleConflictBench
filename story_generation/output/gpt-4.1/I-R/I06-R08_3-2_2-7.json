The task was clear: finish the project tonight, so it could be reviewed before upper management\u2019s evaluation tomorrow. My mentor had always emphasized responsibility and reliability, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. But as I glanced at my phone, a message from my friends flashed across the screen\u2014reminding me that this year\u2019s Hajj group was finalizing their plans. I had saved for years, setting aside money with the intention of fulfilling this pillar of my faith. My heart ached at the thought of missing this chance, especially since my friends were going and the timing felt right. Yet, the project demanded my full attention, and I knew my mentor was counting on me. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest\u2014one calling me to professional duty, the other to spiritual fulfillment. I felt torn, anxiety rising as I tried to imagine how I could possibly honor both commitments."}
