As a mentor, I was expected to guide Sister Maria through the intricate process of preparing the altar for the bishop\u2019s visit\u2014a task where even a small mistake could bring embarrassment to our convent. She waited anxiously for my instructions, her eyes searching mine for reassurance and clarity. I knew she needed my full attention, my patience, and my experience.\n\nBut the bell tolled unexpectedly, echoing down the stone corridors. Mother Superior\u2019s voice called us to the chapel for a special healing service for Sister Agnes, who had fallen gravely ill. As a nun, I was expected to drop everything and join my sisters in prayer, to show unity and faith in our time of need.\n\nMy heart pounded as I looked from the open prayer book on my desk to Sister Maria\u2019s trembling hands. The demands of my two roles pulled me in opposite directions\u2014one to the chapel, one to the altar. I closed my eyes, feeling the tension twist inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left undone."}
