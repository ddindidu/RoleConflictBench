She thought I was upset with her, misreading the tone of my rushed text. I knew I should call her right away, clear things up before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate, don\u2019t let things fester. But just as I reached for my phone, my father\u2019s voice called from the hallway. The synagogue needed one more person for the minyan to say Kaddish for a member\u2019s funeral. Without me, the prayer couldn\u2019t happen. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in\u2014my friend needed reassurance, but my community needed me to fulfill a sacred obligation.
