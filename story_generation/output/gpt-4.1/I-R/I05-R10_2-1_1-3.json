Every week, I check in, offering advice and encouragement, determined to help them succeed. Today, as we wait in the cafeteria line, I see my mentee quietly slip ahead of someone distracted by their phone. It\u2019s a small thing, but as a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to uphold dharma\u2014righteousness\u2014even in the smallest acts. My mind races: should I call out the behavior, risking embarrassment and possibly damaging our trust? Or do I let it slide, prioritizing our mentor-mentee bond and the supportive environment I\u2019ve worked so hard to build? The expectations of my roles pull me in opposite directions\u2014one demands gentle guidance, the other, unwavering ethics. I feel the weight of both, my heart pounding as I wrestle with what to do next."}
