The lines blurred together as I tried to focus, but my mind kept drifting to the preparations for tomorrow\u2019s religious holiday\u2014the most significant of the year. As a priest, the community expected me to lead the prayers, offer guidance, and be present for everyone who would fill the sanctuary. My phone buzzed with messages from parishioners seeking reassurance and volunteers confirming their roles. Yet, the unfinished code stared back at me, a silent reminder of my commitment as a mentee. My mentor had been clear: the sample must be ready before our next meeting in three days. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I wondered how I could possibly meet the expectations of both those who looked to me for spiritual leadership and the mentor who believed in my potential."}
