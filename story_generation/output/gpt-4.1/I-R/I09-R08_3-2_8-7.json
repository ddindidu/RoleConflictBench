With the power cut, I\u2019m worried about missing deliveries.\u201d She smiled, trusting, and I nodded, feeling the weight of her request. Being a good neighbor meant helping out, especially when someone was away and vulnerable. But as she left, my mind drifted to my own plans\u2014my savings, carefully set aside for Hajj, and the group of friends who had just confirmed their spots for this year\u2019s pilgrimage. The dates overlapped exactly with her trip. \n\nI felt torn. Islam teaches the importance of Hajj, a pillar of my faith, and I had waited years for this chance. Yet, being a neighbor also meant reliability, especially in times of need. If I left, I\u2019d let her down; if I stayed, I might miss my once-in-a-lifetime journey. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood in my hallway, heart pounding, unsure which duty should come first."}
