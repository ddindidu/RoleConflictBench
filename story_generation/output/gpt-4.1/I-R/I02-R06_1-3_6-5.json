She was upset that I hadn\u2019t told her about my church plans for Sunday, and now she thought I was avoiding spending time with her. As her boyfriend, I knew I should call her, talk things through, and make sure she felt heard. We\u2019d always promised to resolve conflicts quickly, never letting small misunderstandings fester. But Sunday was also the day of our church\u2019s monthly outreach, and as a committed Christian, I was expected to be there\u2014not just for the service, but to help with the community lunch afterward. My pastor had reminded us last week how important it was to show up, to be present for each other and for those we served. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me: Mia needed me to prioritize our relationship, but my faith community needed me, too. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be both the boyfriend she deserved and the Christian I wanted to be."}
