It was Mark, an old friend from college, his voice shaky. \u201cMy car broke down on Route 7. I\u2019m stranded. Can you help?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014thirty minutes until the class started. As a priest, I knew the children and their parents counted on me to be there, to guide them, to keep the rhythm of their faith steady. But as an acquaintance, I couldn\u2019t ignore Mark\u2019s plea. He\u2019d helped me move apartments years ago, and I remembered how grateful I\u2019d been. My mind raced: if I left now, I\u2019d miss the class, disappoint the kids, and disrupt the schedule. If I stayed, Mark would be alone, maybe for hours, on a deserted road. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension twist inside me, unsure which duty should come first."}
