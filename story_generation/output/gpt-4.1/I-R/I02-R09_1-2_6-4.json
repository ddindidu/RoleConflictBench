As her boyfriend, I knew I should be the one to break the silence, to smooth things over before it grew into something bigger. But my stomach rumbled, reminding me that we hadn\u2019t eaten since morning. I scanned the area, searching for somewhere we could grab a quick bite. The only place nearby was a tiny vendor I recognized from my research\u2014one of the few kosher-certified spots in this city. \n\nShe glanced at the menu, her face falling. \u201cNothing here looks good to me,\u201d she said quietly. I felt the familiar tug-of-war inside me: the urge to suggest we go somewhere else, to show her I cared about her comfort, clashing with the deep-rooted commitment to my Jewish practice. I wanted to resolve our argument, to be the attentive boyfriend she deserved, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the boundaries I\u2019d set for myself. My mind raced, caught between the need to heal our rift and the need to honor my faith, unsure which part of me should speak first."}
