The room buzzed with quiet conversation, and I noticed a young woman standing alone, her hands twisting nervously. I felt the familiar tug of my role as a friend, the urge to approach her, offer a gentle smile, and draw her into the warmth of the group. But as I took a step forward, the church bell chimed\u2014an urgent reminder of the special healing service for Sister Agnes, who had fallen gravely ill. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to pray and support my community in faith, especially during such a critical time.\n\nMy heart pulled in two directions. The young woman\u2019s anxious eyes met mine, silently pleading for connection, while the echo of the bell pressed on my conscience, reminding me of my sacred duty. I felt the weight of both expectations\u2014one calling for compassion in the moment, the other for devotion and solidarity with my sisters. I hesitated, torn between the warmth of human kindness and the solemnity of my spiritual commitment, unsure which path to follow."}
