Just us before you leave.\u201d My heart lifts\u2014this is our only evening together before I\u2019m gone all week. I want to make it special, to show her she\u2019s my priority. But then I remember: it\u2019s Thursday, and the synagogue holds its regular service tonight. I\u2019ve always tried to be consistent, to show up, to be counted. My parents raised me to value community, to honor tradition, and I know how much it means to them\u2014and to me, if I\u2019m honest.\n\nBut tonight, the pull is different. Rachel\u2019s been patient with my commitments, but I see the hope in her eyes when she talks about our plans. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my faith, my family\u2019s expectations, and the promise I made to her. I sit on the edge of my bed, phone in hand, torn between the comfort of ritual and the warmth of her smile, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
