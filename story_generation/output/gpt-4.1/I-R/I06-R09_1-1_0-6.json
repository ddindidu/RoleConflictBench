She\u2019d said it wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew she valued initiative and diligence. I wanted to show her I was committed, that I took her suggestions seriously, even if the deadline was weeks away. As I highlighted a passage, my phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was the regular synagogue service. My family expected me to go, and I felt a tug of responsibility to my community. I knew the service would go on without me\u2014attendance was always good\u2014but skipping felt like letting down a part of myself, a tradition I cherished. I stared at the book, then at my suit hanging on the door, feeling the weight of both expectations. My mentor\u2019s trust, my community\u2019s rhythm, my own sense of belonging\u2014each pulled at me, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure which part of myself to honor tonight."}
