She\u2019s been looking forward to it, even planning a quiet dinner at her place. But as we sit with friends at a community gathering, someone brings up a story from scripture, and all eyes turn to me. They expect me, as their pastor, to share insights, to guide the conversation with wisdom and care. I see my girlfriend\u2019s hopeful glance\u2014she wants me to herself tonight, to talk and laugh without interruption. But the group waits, eager for me to step into my pastoral role. My heart tugs in two directions: the boyfriend who wants to cherish this rare time with her, and the pastor who feels responsible for nurturing his community. I can feel the weight of both expectations pressing in, and I know whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
