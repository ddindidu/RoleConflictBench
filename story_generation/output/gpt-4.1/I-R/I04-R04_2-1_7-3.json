My friend\u2019s message was sharp, wounded\u2014he\u2019d taken my joke the wrong way, and now he thought I was mocking him. I knew I had to call him, to explain, to fix this before the hurt grew deeper. That\u2019s what friends do: we talk things out, clear the air, make sure misunderstandings don\u2019t fester. But as I reached for my phone, the mosque\u2019s clock chimed. It was almost time for the Friday sermon. I was the imam, and the congregation expected me to deliver the khutbah, to guide them, to be present in mind and spirit. The guest speaker was ready, yes, but I\u2019d promised the community I would speak today. My friend\u2019s pain tugged at me, demanding my attention, while the weight of my responsibility as imam pressed down just as hard. I stood in the quiet of my office, torn between the call I needed to make and the sermon I needed to give, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds."}
