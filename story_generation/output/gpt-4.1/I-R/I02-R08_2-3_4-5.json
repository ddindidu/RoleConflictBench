It\u2019s the only night we have together before I leave for a week, and she\u2019s dressed up for me\u2014her favorite dress, a little more revealing than what\u2019s usually seen here. She smiles, excited to share this part of my life, and I feel a surge of affection. But as we approach the main prayer hall for Friday worship, my heart pounds. I know the expectations: as a Muslim, I\u2019m supposed to ensure we both dress modestly, especially in the mosque. I can already sense the stares from a few elders nearby. I want her to feel welcome, not judged. I want to spend this precious evening together, not ruin it with awkwardness or rules. But I also feel the weight of my faith, the responsibility to uphold its guidelines. My mind races, torn between making her feel loved and included, and staying true to what I believe. I hesitate at the entrance, caught between two worlds, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
