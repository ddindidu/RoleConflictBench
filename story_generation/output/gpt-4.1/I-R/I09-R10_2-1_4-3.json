I could see her flinch, and I felt a pang of guilt. As a neighbor, I know I should keep the shared spaces peaceful and respect everyone\u2019s comfort. I apologized, but my dog\u2019s excitement is hard to control sometimes. Later at work, I noticed a colleague quietly slipping ahead in the coffee line. As a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to uphold dharma\u2014doing what\u2019s right, even in small matters. I felt a tug to speak up, but then I remembered how I\u2019d just disturbed my neighbor\u2019s peace. Was I being hypocritical, caring about a minor ethical slip at work while struggling to manage my own responsibilities at home? The expectations from both sides pressed on me, and I found myself torn, wondering which role I should honor more in this moment."}
