My mentor had always encouraged me to reach out with any questions, no matter how small. Today, a term in my reading puzzled me\u2014not enough to halt my progress, but enough to nag at the back of my mind. I knew she expected me to communicate openly, to show engagement and initiative. \n\nBut as I reached for my notebook, the bell rang, signaling a special healing service for Sister Agnes. It wasn\u2019t part of our usual routine, but attendance was expected\u2014especially from those of us who had taken vows to support our community in prayer. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to my mentor, who trusted me to be honest and proactive, and the call to join my sisters in prayer for someone in need. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, uncertain which path to take."}
