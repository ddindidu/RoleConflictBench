As an acquaintance, I knew he expected a warm smile, maybe a light joke, something to ease the silence between us. I mustered a friendly nod, but my mind was elsewhere. Just moments before, a young man had rushed into the mosque, his face streaked with tears, desperate for guidance after losing his father. As the imam, I was expected to offer immediate comfort, to be present and wise, to help him find solace in faith. The weight of his grief pressed on me, demanding my full attention and compassion. Yet here I was, caught between the need to be approachable and lighthearted for Ahmed, and the urgent, sacred responsibility waiting for me in the prayer room. My heart raced as I tried to balance these roles, feeling the strain of being pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
