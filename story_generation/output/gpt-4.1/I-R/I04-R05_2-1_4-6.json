It was David, my old college friend. His voice was frantic\u2014he was on his way to the airport, convinced he\u2019d left his passport at home. \u201cCan you check my apartment and, if it\u2019s there, bring it to me? My flight\u2019s in three hours,\u201d he pleaded. I could hear the panic in his voice, and I knew how much this trip meant to him. As his friend, I wanted nothing more than to help.\n\nJust as I was grabbing my keys, my phone rang again. This time, it was a young couple from the congregation. They were planning their wedding for next summer and wanted to know if I could officiate. They sounded so hopeful, eager to secure a date and begin their new life together with my blessing. I knew how important it was for them to have their rabbi\u2019s support and presence.\n\nStanding in my hallway, keys in one hand and phone in the other, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My friend needed me now, but so did my community. I could feel my heart racing, torn between loyalty and duty, friendship and calling."}
