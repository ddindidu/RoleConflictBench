As a neighbor, I wanted to be friendly, to show warmth and openness, especially since I was new here. I spotted Mrs. Rahman watering her plants and thought it was the perfect moment. But just as I stepped outside, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the mosque committee. The regular backup imam was away, and the congregation was gathering, expecting me to lead the prayer. I glanced at the cake, then at the mosque in the distance. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles. If I delayed, I might disappoint the congregation, who relied on me for spiritual guidance. But if I rushed off, I\u2019d miss the chance to connect with my neighbors, perhaps coming across as distant or unfriendly. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood there, torn, cake in hand, unsure which door to walk through first."}
