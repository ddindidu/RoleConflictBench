It was Priya, an old college friend. Her voice trembled as she explained her car had broken down on a deserted road nearby, and she needed someone to come help her. As an acquaintance, I knew the right thing was to offer support, especially since she sounded so anxious. But as a practicing Hindu, I had set aside this time for my daily rituals\u2014lighting the lamp, offering flowers, and reciting prayers. Missing this sacred routine always left me feeling unsettled, as if I\u2019d let something important slip away. I stared at the flickering flame, torn between the urgent call for help and the quiet pull of my faith. My mind raced, weighing Priya\u2019s need against the comfort and discipline of my spiritual practice, feeling the tension tighten in my chest as I stood frozen, unable to move toward either choice."}
