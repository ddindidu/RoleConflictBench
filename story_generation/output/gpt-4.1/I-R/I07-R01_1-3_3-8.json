As a colleague, I knew the report I was working on wasn\u2019t urgent\u2014there was plenty of buffer time, and my team could move forward without it for now. Still, I felt the unspoken expectation to keep pace, to show reliability and commitment. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the intensive workshop for community leaders was about to begin. As their pastor, I was expected not just to show up, but to guide them through challenging theological concepts, to be present, attentive, and wise. I could picture their eager faces, hungry for understanding, relying on me to help them grow. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014one toward the quiet, steady rhythm of office work, the other toward the pulsing urgency of spiritual leadership. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my best, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the expectations of my colleagues and the needs of my congregation, unsure which path to choose."}
