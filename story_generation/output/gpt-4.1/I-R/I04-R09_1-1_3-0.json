It was my friend, Sarah, her message popping up with a frantic, \u201cCan you hop on a video call? I\u2019m losing my mind with this IKEA bookshelf.\u201d I could almost hear the frustration in her words. As a friend, I knew she counted on me, especially in moments like this when she felt overwhelmed and alone. But as a parent and a Jew, I\u2019d promised myself to make these study sessions a priority, to pass on the stories and values that shaped me. The kids were already waiting at the table, their books open, eyes expectant. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014Sarah\u2019s need for immediate help, my children\u2019s need for consistency and connection. My heart raced as I stared at the phone, torn between being the friend Sarah needed right now and the parent my children expected.
