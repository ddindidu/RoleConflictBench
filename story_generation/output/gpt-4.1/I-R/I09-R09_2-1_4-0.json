I wince, knowing how much she values peace and quiet, and I remember the last time she gently asked if I could keep him calmer near the shared doors. As a neighbor, I want to be considerate, to respect the boundaries and comfort of those living around me. But tonight is also the weekly slot I set aside to teach my children about our Jewish traditions\u2014stories of resilience, songs, and prayers that connect us to our heritage. The kids look forward to it, and I feel a deep responsibility to pass on these values. I could shift the lesson to another time, but it\u2019s become a cherished routine. Yet, if I don\u2019t address the barking now, I risk straining the neighborly trust I\u2019ve worked to build. My mind races, torn between honoring my commitment to my children and being the considerate neighbor I strive to be. The hallway grows quiet, but inside, the tension only grows louder."}
