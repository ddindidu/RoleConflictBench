My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had left for her trip yesterday, trusting me to keep an eye on her apartment and collect any packages. I glanced at her door, remembering her anxious face as she handed me her spare key. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from Father Thomas: a parishioner, Maria, was in distress and needed to meet with me for guidance. As a nun, I knew my presence and counsel could be vital for Maria\u2019s faith. Yet, I also felt the weight of Mrs. Lee\u2019s trust\u2014her deliveries could spoil or be stolen in the powerless hallway. I felt torn, the expectations of neighborly care and spiritual duty pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which call to answer first, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me."}
