As a neighbor, I knew I was expected to be friendly, to smooth over the tension that had built up after the noise complaint circulated. Mrs. Kim from 4B caught my eye, her smile tight, and I nodded politely, careful to keep my tone light and nonjudgmental. Just as I was about to join the group, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mark, a parishioner. He wanted to know if we could talk soon, nothing urgent, just a general inquiry. As a priest, I felt the weight of his request, the expectation to be available, to offer guidance whenever needed. But right now, my neighbors expected me to be present, to help ease the awkwardness and keep things civil. I could feel the pull from both sides\u2014one demanding my empathy and presence as a neighbor, the other my spiritual support as a priest. My mind raced, torn between the immediate need for neighborly diplomacy and the quiet, persistent call to serve my parishioner."}
