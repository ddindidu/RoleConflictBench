She\u2019s really slipping.\u201d I felt a familiar discomfort rise in my chest. As an acquaintance, I knew I should avoid gossiping or speaking negatively about others, but the group\u2019s attention was fixed on me, waiting for my reaction. Before I could respond, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the church secretary: someone had arrived at the chapel, desperate for spiritual guidance, in tears and unable to wait. As a priest, I was expected to provide immediate support and comfort to those in crisis. I glanced at the group, their eyes expectant, and then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. My mind raced\u2014should I address the gossip, risking awkwardness, or excuse myself abruptly to tend to the person in need at the church? The demands of both roles pulled at me, and I stood there, heart pounding, caught between the expectations of my acquaintances and my calling as a priest."}
