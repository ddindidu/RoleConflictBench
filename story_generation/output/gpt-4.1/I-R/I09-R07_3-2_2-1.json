As a neighbor, I felt the weight of expectation to be friendly, to smooth over the tension with polite words and a calm presence. Mrs. Lee glanced at me, her eyes searching for reassurance, and I nodded, trying to offer comfort. Yet, my mind kept drifting to the temple, where tonight\u2019s memorial service would soon begin. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be there, to join in the chanting and rituals, to support the community in honoring the departed. The thought of missing the ceremony filled me with guilt, but leaving the meeting early would seem rude, perhaps even uncaring, to my neighbors. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the demands of both roles, feeling pulled in two directions, uncertain which expectation I should honor."}
