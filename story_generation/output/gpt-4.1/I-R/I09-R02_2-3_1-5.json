I wanted to be the kind of neighbor who was friendly and approachable, someone who could be counted on for a smile or a helping hand. As I stepped out, cake carefully balanced, my phone buzzed urgently. It was a message from the church: someone had arrived, desperate and in tears, seeking immediate spiritual guidance. As a priest, I knew the weight of such moments\u2014how a few words, a listening ear, could mean everything to someone in crisis. But here I was, standing at the threshold of my new home, cake in hand, ready to fulfill the simple, human expectation of neighborly warmth. My heart pounded as I looked from the cake to my car keys, torn between the gentle welcome I wanted to offer and the deep responsibility I felt to answer a soul in need."}
