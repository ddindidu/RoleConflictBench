I\u2019d planned to recite and reflect, to reconnect with my faith after a hectic few days. The house was silent, the world outside already asleep. I had just opened the Quran when my phone buzzed, shattering the calm. It was my closest friend, her name lighting up the screen. I answered, and immediately heard her sobbing. Through broken words, she told me her family had just received terrible news. She needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to comfort her, to just be there. As she cried, I felt torn. My heart ached for her, but I also felt the pull of my spiritual commitment, the peace I\u2019d been craving. I wanted to be the friend she needed, but I also wanted to honor my intention to spend this time with Allah. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat there, phone in hand, caught between two worlds, unsure which to choose."}
