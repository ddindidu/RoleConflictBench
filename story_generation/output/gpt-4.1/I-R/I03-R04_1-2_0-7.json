I really need your guidance.\u201d She\u2019d never asked for help so urgently before. As the imam, I knew how much she depended on me, especially now, with her family falling apart. But just then, I glanced at my partner, slumped beside me, rubbing his temples. He\u2019d barely spoken since coming home, and I could sense the weight of his day pressing down on him. As his girlfriend, I wanted to be present, to listen, to offer comfort\u2014he needed me, too. My heart tugged in two directions: the community\u2019s spiritual needs and the quiet, personal support my partner deserved. I felt the pressure mounting, the expectations of both roles swirling inside me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. I stared at my phone, torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
