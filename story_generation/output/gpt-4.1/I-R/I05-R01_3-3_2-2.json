On my desk were two files: one for Daniel, my mentee, anxiously awaiting my advice on whether to accept a high-pressure job offer that could launch his career, and another for Maria, a member of my congregation, who had come to me in tears, wrestling with a decision that could shatter her family. As Daniel\u2019s mentor, I was expected to lay out the pros and cons, to be practical and strategic, to help him weigh risks and rewards. But as Maria\u2019s pastor, I was called to listen deeply, to offer compassion and spiritual wisdom, to help her discern what was right in her heart and in the eyes of God.\n\nThe demands pressed in from both sides. Daniel needed clarity and a plan; Maria needed comfort and faith. I felt torn, my mind racing with structured advice for one and gentle prayers for the other. How could I be both the steady guide and the empathetic shepherd, when each role seemed to pull me in opposite directions? My hands trembled as I reached for the phone, uncertain which call to make first."}
