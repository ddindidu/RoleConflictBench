I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d I hesitated, feeling the familiar tug of obligation. As an acquaintance, I know how much it means to show up when someone asks for help, especially with something as stressful as moving. But as I scrolled through my calendar, my heart sank. Saturday was also the day of the first planning meeting for the adult faith formation series at church\u2014a meeting I was supposed to organize and lead. The parish expects me to be there, to guide the team and set the tone for the whole season. I could already imagine the disappointment if I missed it, the questions about my commitment. Yet, I also pictured Mark struggling with heavy boxes, counting on me. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between the needs of my community and the needs of a friend."}
