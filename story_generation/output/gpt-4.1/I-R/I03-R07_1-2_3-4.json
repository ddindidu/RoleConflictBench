Just us.\u201d My heart warms. We haven\u2019t had a quiet evening together in weeks, and I know how much it means to him when I\u2019m fully present, laughing and sharing stories over our favorite noodles. I want to say yes, to give him my time, to be the girlfriend who makes him feel cherished.\n\nBut tonight is also the weekly group meditation at the temple. It\u2019s the one hour I dedicate to sitting in silence, breathing with others, letting go of the week\u2019s noise. My teacher always says consistency is the heart of practice, and I promised myself I\u2019d show up, not just for me, but for the sangha. I feel the tug\u2014his hope for closeness, my own commitment to mindfulness. My mind races, torn between the warmth of his hand and the quiet of the meditation hall. I want to be both: the loving partner and the devoted practitioner. The weight of choosing presses on my chest, and I sit, phone in hand, unable to type a reply."}
