It was Mark, my old college friend, his name lighting up the screen with a video call request. I hesitated, already feeling the familiar tug-of-war inside me. Mark\u2019s message popped up: \u201cHey, can you hop on for a sec? These furniture instructions are a nightmare.\u201d I could almost hear the frustration in his voice, and I knew he wouldn\u2019t ask unless he really needed help. As a friend, I wanted to be there for him, especially since he\u2019d just moved and was trying to settle in.\n\nBut as a priest, I had a responsibility to the parish. The planning meeting was important\u2014parents and catechists were counting on me to guide the new season, and I\u2019d promised to bring fresh ideas. I could picture the committee waiting, expecting me to lead with focus and care. My heart pounded as I stared at the two screens, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. I wanted to be a good friend, but I also couldn\u2019t let down my community. The minutes ticked by, and I sat frozen, torn between two worlds."}
