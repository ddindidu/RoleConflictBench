My mentee, Sarah, had just called, her voice trembling with anxiety. The project she was leading\u2014her first major assignment\u2014was falling apart, and she needed guidance. She asked if I could meet her early tomorrow, the only time she could spare before her deadline. I knew how much this meant for her career, and as her mentor, I felt responsible to help her grow, to be there when she needed support the most.\n\nBut tomorrow was Sunday. As a Christian, I was expected at church, not just to worship but to serve in the children\u2019s ministry and connect with my faith community. I hadn\u2019t missed a service in months, and I knew my absence would be noticed. The thought of letting down my church family, of missing the spiritual renewal I cherished, weighed heavily on me.\n\nI stared at my calendar, heart pounding, torn between the urgent needs of my mentee and the deep commitments of my faith. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I felt the tension rising, unsure which path I could take without betraying a part of myself."}
