The team meeting was about to start, and this one was crucial\u2014our final discussion before the project decisions were set in stone. As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute my ideas, and to show my commitment to the team. But just as I was about to log in, I noticed a new intern standing by the coffee machine, looking lost and on the verge of tears. My heart tugged at me; as a Christian, I felt a deep responsibility to show kindness, to reach out and offer comfort, just as Jesus would. I knew a few gentle words or a listening ear could make a difference for her. Yet, if I missed the meeting, I risked letting my team down and possibly missing my chance to influence a decision I cared about. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself frozen, torn between the call to be a supportive colleague and the call to live out my faith in a moment of need."}
