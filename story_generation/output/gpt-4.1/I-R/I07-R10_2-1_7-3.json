They needed my input to move forward, and I knew the expectation: respond quickly, keep the workflow smooth. As I started typing my reply, I noticed a colleague quietly slipping ahead in the queue for the office printer, bypassing others who had been waiting. It was a small thing, but my upbringing as a Hindu had instilled in me the importance of dharma\u2014doing what is right, even in minor matters. I felt a tug inside, a sense of responsibility to address the unfairness, to gently remind my colleague about respect and honesty. But if I paused to intervene, I\u2019d delay my team, possibly frustrating them and holding up our project. My mind raced, torn between the immediate demands of my colleagues and the deeper call to uphold my values. I hovered between the two choices, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
