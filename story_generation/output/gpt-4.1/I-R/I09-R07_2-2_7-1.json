I remember Mrs. Lin, my elderly neighbor, who lives alone just down the hall. As a neighbor, I feel a responsibility to check on her, maybe offer to bring her some groceries or just reassure her that someone is nearby if the power goes out. But tonight is also the memorial service at the temple\u2014a significant Buddhist ceremony that I\u2019ve promised to attend. The community expects my presence, and I know how important it is to support others in their grief, to chant and meditate together. My mind tugs in two directions: the quiet duty of neighborly care, and the collective spiritual responsibility I hold as a Buddhist. I pace my apartment, heart heavy, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. The storm outside seems to echo the turmoil within me as I try to decide where I am most needed tonight."}
