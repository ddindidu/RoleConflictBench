My teammates\u2019 arguments had escalated, and our project was falling apart. I knew I should reach out, explain the situation, and ask for guidance\u2014my mentor always said honesty and communication were key. But tonight was the memorial service at the temple, a ceremony I\u2019d promised to attend weeks ago. As a Buddhist, I felt a deep responsibility to be there, to support the community and honor those who had passed. The thought of missing it filled me with guilt, as if I\u2019d be letting down not just the sangha, but my own values. Yet, if I didn\u2019t address the project crisis now, I risked disappointing my mentor and jeopardizing the trust we\u2019d built. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, torn between the urgent needs of my team and the quiet call of the temple bell."}
