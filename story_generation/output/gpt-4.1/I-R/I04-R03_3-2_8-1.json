My careless words had clearly wounded her, and as her friend, I knew I needed to call her right away, to apologize and explain. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate, clear the air, and heal misunderstandings before they fester. But just as I reached for my phone, Sister Agnes burst into my room, her face grave. \u201cThe Thompsons\u2019 house caught fire. They need us at the shelter now\u2014food, clothes, comfort. We must go.\u201d As a nun, my life is devoted to service, to being present for those in crisis, and the community expects me to drop everything for those in need. I felt torn in two\u2014my friend\u2019s pain weighed on my heart, but so did the suffering of the Thompsons. Both roles demanded my immediate presence, my compassion, my time. I stood frozen, phone in hand, torn between the call I needed to make and the call to serve, my heart aching with the impossibility of being fully present for both."}
