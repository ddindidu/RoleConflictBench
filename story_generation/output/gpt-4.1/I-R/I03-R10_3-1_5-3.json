It was the last one before Arjun left for his new job in London, and I wanted every moment to count. We planned a cozy brunch at our favorite caf\u00e9, just the two of us, no distractions. As we waited in line, I noticed a woman quietly slip ahead of an elderly man. My upbringing as a Hindu had always emphasized dharma\u2014doing what\u2019s right, even in small things. I felt a tug inside, a responsibility to speak up, to gently point out the unfairness. But Arjun squeezed my hand, his eyes full of anticipation for our precious time together. I could almost hear his silent plea: \u201cLet\u2019s not get involved, let\u2019s just be together.\u201d My heart twisted. I wanted to honor my values, but I also wanted to give Arjun the undivided attention he deserved before he left. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood there, torn, as the line inched forward."}
