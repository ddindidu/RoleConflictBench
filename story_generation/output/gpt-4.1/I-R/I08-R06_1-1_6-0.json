A few colleagues were discussing Mark\u2019s recent decisions at work, their voices tinged with judgment and amusement. As an acquaintance, I felt the unspoken pressure to join in, to laugh or add my own opinion, to fit in and not seem aloof. But as a Christian, I knew I was called to something higher\u2014to avoid gossip, to speak kindly, and to guard my words. My heart pounded as I listened, torn between the easy camaraderie of the group and the quiet voice inside urging me to live out my faith. I could feel their eyes on me, waiting for my reaction, and the tension inside me grew. If I stayed silent, would they think I was judging them? If I joined in, would I betray my values? The weight of their expectations pressed in from both sides, and I found myself caught in the middle, wrestling with what to do next."}
