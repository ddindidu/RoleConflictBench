She was already on her way to visit her daughter, and she\u2019d asked if I could keep an eye out for her packages, especially with the planned power outage in the building. I\u2019d always tried to be a good neighbor\u2014helpful, reliable, the kind of person others could count on. But as I glanced at the stack of books and notes on my table, my heart tightened. The High Holidays were approaching, and I was expected to deliver a sermon that would inspire and guide my entire congregation. The pressure was immense; every word would be weighed, every message scrutinized. I knew I needed hours of quiet reflection and preparation, but the thought of Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s deliveries sitting in a dark hallway, or worse, going missing, gnawed at me. I felt torn\u2014between the gentle, everyday kindness of neighborliness and the sacred, consuming responsibility of my calling as a rabbi. The demands of both roles pressed in, and I found myself standing in the silence, uncertain which expectation I could afford to let down."}
