The whole team is counting on me to keep things moving. My phone buzzes\u2014a gentle reminder from the meditation group. Every Thursday at four, we gather in the quiet room, close our eyes, and let go of the week\u2019s stress. As a Buddhist, I promised myself I\u2019d honor this hour, to be present and mindful, not just for myself but as an example to others. But now, the pressure of the deadline weighs on me. If I leave my desk, I risk letting my colleagues down. If I stay, I break my commitment to my practice and to the group. My mind races, torn between the urgent demands of work and the quiet call to stillness. I sit, hands hovering over the keyboard, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both matter deeply to me."}
