As a neighbor, I knew the importance of being friendly, especially now that a noise complaint had everyone on edge. Mrs. Rahman, who lived across the hall, greeted me with a tense smile. I returned it, careful to keep my tone light and polite, even as I sensed the undercurrent of frustration in the group. We all wanted peace, but no one wanted to accuse anyone directly.\n\nJust as I tried to ease the tension, Brother Yusuf approached, his voice low. \u201cImam, if you have a moment later, I could really use your advice,\u201d he said, eyes hopeful. I nodded, feeling the weight of his expectation. As an imam, I am called to offer guidance, to be present for those who seek counsel, no matter how busy or tired I am.\n\nStanding there, I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one part of me striving to be the considerate neighbor, smoothing over discomfort, the other feeling the responsibility to provide spiritual support. The demands pressed in, and I wondered how I could possibly meet both without letting someone down."}
