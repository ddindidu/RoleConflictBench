The theme was compassion and understanding\u2014how we are called to love our neighbors as ourselves. Just as I was writing about patience, my dog started barking loudly in the hallway. I heard Mrs. Lee from next door sigh in frustration as she passed by our shared door. I knew she expected me, as her neighbor, to keep the noise down and respect our shared space. But as a pastor, I felt the weight of preparing a message that would inspire others to live harmoniously. The irony wasn\u2019t lost on me. I felt torn\u2014should I pause my sermon prep to calm my dog and apologize to Mrs. Lee, or should I focus on crafting the words that might help my congregation become better neighbors themselves? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, heart pounding, caught between the roles I was supposed to fulfill."}
