It\u2019s our only evening before I leave.\u201d My heart fluttered, remembering how we\u2019d planned this night for weeks, just the two of us, no distractions. But as I set the phone down, the chapel bell echoed through the halls\u2014an urgent call. Mother Superior\u2019s voice followed, gentle but firm: \u201cWe\u2019re holding a healing service for Sister Agnes tonight. Your presence is needed.\u201d I felt the weight of my habit, the vows I\u2019d taken, the community that depended on me. Yet, my heart tugged in another direction, toward laughter, warmth, and the comfort of his arms. Both worlds expected my devotion, my time, my love. I sat on the edge of my bed, torn between the sacred and the personal, the call of faith and the call of my heart, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
