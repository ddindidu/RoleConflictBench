She\u2019s asked me before to help with her packages, and I know how much she relies on me\u2014especially since she\u2019s elderly and can\u2019t always get to the post office. At the same time, today is Friday, and as the imam, I\u2019m expected to deliver the Khutbah. The congregation looks to me for guidance, and I feel the weight of their trust. But today, there\u2019s a guest speaker who\u2019s prepared and ready to step in if I\u2019m not there. I glance at the clock, feeling the tension build inside me. If I stay home to help my neighbor, I might disappoint those who expect my presence at the mosque. If I leave for the mosque, I\u2019ll let down someone who depends on me in a different, quieter way. My heart pounds as I wrestle with these conflicting responsibilities, torn between the call of community and the quiet needs of the woman next door."}
