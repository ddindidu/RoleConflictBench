It was Daniel, an old acquaintance from college. He sounded desperate\u2014his moving company had canceled last minute, and he needed help moving boxes into his new apartment. He asked if I could spare a few hours that afternoon. As an acquaintance, I felt the pull to say yes, to be supportive and helpful, especially since he rarely asked for favors.\n\nBut as I hung up, my eyes drifted to the stack of notes on my desk. The High Holiday service was just two days away, and I still hadn\u2019t finished my sermon. The congregation would be expecting something meaningful, something that would resonate with them during this sacred time. As their rabbi, I owed them my best effort, my full attention.\n\nI felt the tension rising in my chest. Daniel needed me now, but so did my community. If I helped him, I\u2019d lose precious hours of preparation. If I declined, I\u2019d feel like I was letting down someone who trusted me. The weight of both roles pressed in, and I sat there, torn, unsure which expectation I could afford to disappoint."}
