Our weekend plans had gotten mixed up\u2014she thought we were meeting her friends, but I\u2019d promised my parents I\u2019d help at the temple. The air between us was tense, and I knew as her boyfriend, I should smooth things over, listen, and find a way to make her feel heard. Just as I was about to apologize, I noticed a man at the next table slipping a thick envelope to the manager, who quickly tucked it away. I overheard enough to realize it was a bribe, something that went against everything I\u2019d been taught as a Hindu\u2014to stand up for what\u2019s right, to act with integrity. My heart pounded. Priya was waiting for me to fix things between us, but my conscience screamed at me to intervene, to call out the wrongdoing. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which voice to listen to first."}
