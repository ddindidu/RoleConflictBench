The code wouldn\u2019t run, and I\u2019d already spent hours trying to fix it. As a mentee, I knew I should email my mentor, let her know I was stuck, and ask for help. She always said, \u201cDon\u2019t wait until you\u2019re overwhelmed\u2014reach out early.\u201d But the clock on my wall reminded me of my other role. In half an hour, I was supposed to teach the weekly adult education class at the synagogue. It was optional, but I knew a few regulars would be there, expecting me to guide them through the week\u2019s Torah portion. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the responsibility to be honest and proactive with my mentor, and the commitment to my community as their rabbi. My mind raced, torn between sending the email and preparing for the class, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both well at the same time. My heart pounded as I sat at my desk, wrestling with which expectation to meet first."}
