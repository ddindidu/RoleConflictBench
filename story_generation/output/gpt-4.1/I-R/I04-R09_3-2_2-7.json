It was Sarah, her voice trembling, barely able to get the words out between sobs. Her father had just been rushed to the hospital, and she needed someone to talk to, someone to listen. I sat up, heart pounding, knowing how much she relied on me in moments like this. I wanted to be there for her, to offer comfort and let her pour out her pain.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my stomach twisted. In just a few hours, I was supposed to be at synagogue, chanting my assigned Torah portion\u2014a commitment I\u2019d made weeks ago, one that meant a lot to my community and to me as a Jew. Missing it wasn\u2019t just about disappointing others; it felt like letting down a part of myself. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore. I listened to Sarah\u2019s tears, torn between the friend she needed and the Jew I was expected to be, feeling the ache of not knowing how to be both at once."}
