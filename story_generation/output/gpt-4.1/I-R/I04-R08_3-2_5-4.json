I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she pleaded. As her friend, I knew I should drop everything and help her, especially since it was late and she was alone. But today was also the office function, and I had already promised my boss I\u2019d be there. I\u2019d carefully chosen my outfit to meet Islamic guidelines for modesty, even though I knew some colleagues might find it unusual. If I rushed to help Sarah, I\u2019d have to go straight from the highway to the office, possibly arriving late, disheveled, and drawing even more attention to my appearance. I felt torn\u2014my friend needed me, but I also wanted to honor my faith and not stand out at work. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, phone in hand, heart pounding, unsure which role I could bear to disappoint."}
