My mind aches for that quiet, a brief escape from the constant ping of emails and the pressure of deadlines. But my screen is filled with unfinished code, and I know that if I don\u2019t finish this module now, Sarah won\u2019t be able to start her part tomorrow. The project manager\u2019s words echo in my head: \u201cWe\u2019re counting on you to keep things moving.\u201d I feel the weight of my team\u2019s expectations, the unspoken trust that I won\u2019t be the one to slow us down.\n\nYet, my heart tugs me toward the cushion in the corner, the one place I can breathe and let go. I promised myself I\u2019d honor this practice, to be present and gentle with my mind. But now, the two worlds collide\u2014my duty to my colleagues and my commitment to my own peace. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between the urgent and the essential, as the minutes slip away."}
