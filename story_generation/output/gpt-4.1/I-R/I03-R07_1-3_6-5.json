He\u2019s upset that I forgot about our brunch plans this weekend, and I can feel the tension rising between us. As his girlfriend, I know I should call him right now, talk things through, and smooth over the misunderstanding before it grows. That\u2019s what a good partner does\u2014resolves conflicts, doesn\u2019t let them fester. But my other phone buzzes with a reminder: the weekly meditation group meets in fifteen minutes, and I\u2019m leading today. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to be present, calm, and guide others in mindfulness. I can\u2019t be late, and I can\u2019t bring my emotional turmoil into the session. My heart pounds with the pressure of both roles. I want to be there for Alex, but I also want to honor my commitment to the sangha and my own practice. The demands pull at me from both sides, and I sit frozen, torn between the urge to fix things with Alex and the responsibility to lead my group in peace."}
