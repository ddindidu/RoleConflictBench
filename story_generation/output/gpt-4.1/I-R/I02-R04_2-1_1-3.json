My heart ached to see her so defeated. As her boyfriend, I wanted nothing more than to hold her, listen, and reassure her that she was more than her job. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that it was nearly time for Friday prayers. As the imam, the community expected me to deliver the Khutbah, to guide and inspire them. I knew the guest speaker was ready, but I also knew some congregants looked forward to my words each week, and I felt a responsibility not to disappoint them. Aisha\u2019s hand gripped mine, silently pleading for me to stay. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my community and the need to be present for the woman I love. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each pulling me in a different direction."}
