My heart ached to hold him, to be present, to offer every ounce of comfort I could muster. He needed me\u2014just me, not the rabbi, not the community leader, but his girlfriend, his anchor in this storm. My phone buzzed on the nightstand. I glanced at the screen: an email from a couple, asking if I could officiate their wedding next year. They wanted to meet soon, to discuss dates and details. As a rabbi, I knew how important it was to respond promptly, to show care and commitment to those seeking my guidance. But every moment I spent away from my partner felt like a betrayal of his grief, a failure to be the support he deserved. My mind spun with guilt and responsibility, torn between the sacred trust of my calling and the raw, immediate need of the person I loved most. I stared at the phone, my heart pounding, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
