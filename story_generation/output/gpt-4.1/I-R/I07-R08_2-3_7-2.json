The subject lines are urgent\u2014everyone is waiting for my clarification before they can move forward with the project. I know they expect a quick response; we\u2019ve all agreed to keep communication tight, especially with the deadline looming. But as I open my laptop, my eyes fall on the Quran resting on my desk. Tonight is the community study circle, and I haven\u2019t read the assigned verses yet. I promised myself I\u2019d recite and reflect before the meeting, not just skim through. My colleagues are counting on me to keep the workflow moving, but my heart aches with the thought of showing up unprepared for the study circle, letting down my community and my own spiritual commitment. The minutes tick by, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my attention, each unwilling to wait. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between the urgent and the important, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
