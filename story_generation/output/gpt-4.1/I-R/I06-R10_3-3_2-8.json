She\u2019d been clear: this task had to be done before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation by upper management. My phone buzzed with a reminder from my family group chat\u2014tonight was the festival, the one we\u2019d been planning for months. As a Hindu, I was expected to travel with my family, participate in every ritual, and offer prayers with full devotion. The thought of missing even a part of the ceremony filled me with guilt; it was more than tradition, it was a promise to my family and my faith. But the weight of my mentor\u2019s expectations pressed on me just as heavily. I could almost hear her voice, reminding me how important this assignment was for my growth and reputation. My heart pounded as I packed my bag, torn between the laptop and the prayer tray, between my future and my faith, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
