The argument had spiraled out of control, and now he was questioning if we should even stay together. As his girlfriend, I felt the pressure to resolve this, to fight for us, to prove that our relationship was worth saving. But every time I opened my mouth, anger threatened to spill out, and I worried I\u2019d only make things worse.\n\nAt the same time, my heart ached with the teachings I\u2019d grown up with\u2014love your neighbor, turn the other cheek, show compassion even when it\u2019s hard. I knew I should respond with kindness, listen with patience, and offer forgiveness, just as Jesus would. But the hurt and frustration inside me made it almost impossible. I could feel the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, and I was caught in the middle, wrestling with what to do next."}
