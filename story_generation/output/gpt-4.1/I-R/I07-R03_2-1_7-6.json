The quiet of the afternoon was a rare gift, and I had been looking forward to this time of spiritual reading and reflection all week. Just as I closed my eyes to pray, my phone buzzed insistently. A string of messages from my colleagues flashed on the screen\u2014questions about a project, requests for clarification. The team was waiting for my input before they could move forward. I knew the expectation: respond promptly, be a reliable part of the group. But the silence around me felt sacred, and I longed to honor my commitment to spiritual study, to be present with God in these precious moments. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward duty and toward devotion. I stared at the phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, uncertain which call to answer first."}
