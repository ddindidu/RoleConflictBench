I always try to be available, sharing what I\u2019ve learned, guiding them through the maze of office politics and technical details. It\u2019s rewarding, but lately, my mind has been elsewhere. My son\u2019s bar mitzvah is just weeks away, and he\u2019s still struggling with his Torah portion. As a Jewish parent, I feel the weight of tradition pressing on me\u2014the expectation to pass down our history, to ensure he\u2019s ready for this milestone. Every evening, I\u2019m torn: do I stay late to help my mentee, or rush home to practice with my son? My mentee looks up to me, counting on my support, but my son needs me too, and the community expects me to guide him. The demands pull at me from both sides, and I feel stretched thin, guilty for not giving enough to either. As my mentee waits for my answer, I glance at the clock, knowing my son is at home, waiting for me to help him recite the ancient words."}
