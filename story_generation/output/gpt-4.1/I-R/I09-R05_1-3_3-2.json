The High Holiday sermon was only hours away, and my notes were scattered across the table, half-formed ideas swirling in my mind. I needed quiet, focus, and time\u2014none of which I had. Just then, I heard the familiar clatter outside. My neighbor, Mrs. Feldman, was dragging her trash bin to the curb. I remembered the bins were only half-full, but if I didn\u2019t take mine out now, I\u2019d miss the pickup, and the shared alley would overflow by next week. \n\nAs a neighbor, I knew I should be considerate, not leaving my trash to pile up and inconvenience everyone else. But as a rabbi, I felt the weight of my congregation\u2019s expectations pressing on me. They needed inspiration, guidance, and a message that would carry them through the year. My mind raced\u2014should I rush out and deal with the bins, or stay and wrestle with my sermon? The demands of both roles pulled at me, and I felt the tension rising, caught between the needs of my neighbors and the spiritual needs of my community."}
