She confided in me about her mounting deadlines and her struggle to balance work and study. As her mentor, I felt the familiar urge to guide her, to help her set priorities and develop a plan that would nurture her growth. I wanted to be present, to offer her the time and attention she deserved.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with another message from the mayor. The hurricane had devastated our town, and as a nun, I was expected to lead the relief effort. The sisters and I were needed to organize food drives, shelter, and comfort for the displaced. The community looked to us for hope and action.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. Maria\u2019s anxious eyes pleaded for guidance, while the cries of the homeless echoed in my mind. Both roles demanded my full presence, but I only had so much to give. I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
