We had traveled hours to my family\u2019s village for Diwali, and everyone expected me to be present, to light lamps, chant prayers, and show devotion. But my phone buzzed with her messages\u2014she was still upset, questioning if we should even be together. As a boyfriend, I felt I should be with her, talk things through, resolve the fight before it grew worse. But as a Hindu, my family and community expected me to be at the temple, to honor the gods and traditions.
