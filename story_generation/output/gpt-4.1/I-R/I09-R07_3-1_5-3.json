My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, was moving her potted plants and a stack of boxes, cluttering the hallway. I remembered the HOA notice: anything left in the corridor during today\u2019s inspection could get us all in trouble. As a neighbor, I felt responsible to remind her\u2014after all, we all share this space, and I didn\u2019t want anyone fined or cited for blocking the emergency exit.\n\nBut as a Buddhist, I was supposed to let go of agitation, to focus on the present moment, to cultivate peace. The urge to jump up and intervene clashed with my commitment to this brief, precious window of meditation. My mind raced: Should I break my silence and disturb my practice for the sake of the community? Or should I trust that things would work out, and honor my intention to be still? The tension between my roles pressed in on me, as insistent as the ticking clock and the muffled sounds outside my door."}
