The argument from earlier still echoes in my mind\u2014her words sharp, my responses defensive. She\u2019s questioning if we should even stay together, and I know I can\u2019t let this fester. As her boyfriend, I should be reaching out, apologizing, finding a way to resolve this before it grows into something irreparable. But my laptop is open, a blank document staring back at me. The calendar reminds me that it\u2019s time to start preparing my next Shabbat sermon. As a rabbi, my congregation expects inspiration, guidance, and a message that will resonate weeks from now. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014Leah\u2019s pain and my duty to her, the silent anticipation of my community. My mind races with possible sermon topics, but guilt gnaws at me for not calling Leah. I can\u2019t focus on either task, torn between the person I love and the people who look to me for wisdom. My heart aches, caught in the impossible space between boyfriend and rabbi, knowing I can\u2019t give my whole self to both at this moment."}
