I knew how important this was\u2014my mentor had emphasized that following through on assignments was key to my growth. I wanted to prove myself, to show I was reliable and dedicated. But as I scrolled through my calendar, I saw the office function scheduled for this afternoon. It was a big event, with colleagues from every department, men and women mingling freely. The invitation had a note: \u201cBusiness casual attire encouraged.\u201d I felt a knot in my stomach. Business casual at our office usually meant short sleeves, sometimes even skirts above the knee. I always tried to dress modestly, covering my arms and legs, in line with my faith. I worried about standing out, about being judged or questioned. I also worried about missing out on networking, or seeming distant if I didn\u2019t blend in. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me\u2014my mentor\u2019s expectations, my faith\u2019s requirements, my desire to belong, my need to stay true to myself. I sat at my desk, heart pounding, torn between what I should do next."}
