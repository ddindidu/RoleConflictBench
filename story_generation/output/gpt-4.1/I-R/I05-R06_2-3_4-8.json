As a mentor, I felt the weight of responsibility to share my knowledge, to ensure no one was left behind. The room was set, my notes organized, and I was ready to begin. Just as I was about to start, one of the newer team members, Sarah, arrived late, her eyes red and face drawn. She quietly apologized, explaining in a trembling voice that she\u2019d just received devastating news about a family member. The rest of the group looked at me, waiting for the session to begin, but I could see Sarah needed comfort, not instruction. My mind raced\u2014should I pause everything to show her the compassion my faith calls me to, or press on with the session, honoring my commitment as a mentor to the group? The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt torn, standing at the front of the room, heart pounding, unsure which path to take."}
