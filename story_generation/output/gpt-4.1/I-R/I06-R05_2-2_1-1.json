The logic is tricky, and I know he expects me to have it polished before our next meeting in three days. My phone buzzes with a reminder: Shabbat is coming. As the rabbi, I need to prepare a sermon that will inspire and comfort my congregation. They look to me for guidance, especially this week, after the loss in our community. My mind races between debugging lines of code and searching for the right words for my sermon. I feel the weight of my mentor\u2019s trust\u2014he\u2019s invested so much in my growth, and I don\u2019t want to let him down. At the same time, my congregation expects me to be present, thoughtful, and prepared. The hours slip by, and I feel torn, pulled by two worlds that both matter deeply to me. My heart aches with the pressure, knowing I can\u2019t give less than my best to either."}
