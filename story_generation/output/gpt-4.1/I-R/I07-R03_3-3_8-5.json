An urgent email from my supervisor blinked on the screen\u2014leadership needed my confirmation for tomorrow\u2019s meeting with an external partner. I knew the expectation: prompt replies, clear communication, no delays. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but the chapel bell tolled, echoing down the stone hallway. It was time for evening prayers, and tonight, I was to lead the vigil\u2014a rare honor, one that my sisters and the Mother Superior had entrusted to me. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds. The office demanded my attention, my colleagues counting on me to keep things moving. Yet, my faith called me to the chapel, to the sacred stillness and the waiting congregation. I stared at the screen, torn, feeling the pressure of two lives pulling me in opposite directions, each expecting my full devotion."}
