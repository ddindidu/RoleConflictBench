As a colleague, I knew the importance of meeting deadlines\u2014my part of the report was due tomorrow, and any delay would stall the entire team. I could already picture the frustration on my teammate\u2019s face if I missed the mark. Yet, as I glanced at my calendar, I saw a reminder: \u201cBegin sermon prep.\u201d As the rabbi, I was expected to offer thoughtful, relevant messages each Shabbat, and the congregation counted on me to bring insight and comfort. The pressure to start brainstorming weighed heavily; inspiration didn\u2019t come on command, and I needed time to reflect and research. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014one toward the immediate, tangible needs of my colleagues, the other toward the spiritual and emotional needs of my community. I felt the tension coil in my chest, knowing that whichever task I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down, or perhaps, letting myself down."}
