As a colleague, I knew I was expected to finish the quarterly report by Friday. There was a generous buffer, and my teammates could continue their work without my section for a few days, but I prided myself on reliability. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, my mind drifted to my other role\u2014rabbi. Shabbat was approaching, and I hadn\u2019t yet prepared my sermon. The congregation looked to me for guidance and inspiration, especially this week, with several families facing difficult times. I felt the weight of their expectations, the need to offer words that would comfort and uplift. My heart tugged in two directions: the steady, logical rhythm of office work and the spiritual, emotional demands of my community. I stared at the blinking cursor, feeling the tension rise within me, knowing I had to choose where to focus my energy, at least for the next few hours."}
