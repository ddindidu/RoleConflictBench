My friend\u2019s message blinked at me: \u201cHad such a long, boring day. Wish someone would just listen.\u201d I knew she needed me, needed the comfort of a friend who would listen without judgment, who would offer warmth and understanding. But just as I began to type a reply, I glanced at the stack of scripture and notes on my desk. The Mother Superior had entrusted me with leading the daily reflections for the retreat\u2014a responsibility that demanded my full attention and spiritual focus. The community was counting on me to guide them, to be present and prepared. My heart tugged in two directions: the urge to be there for my friend, to offer her the support she sought, and the call to fulfill my duty as a nun, to immerse myself in study and prayer. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, my mind swirling with guilt and uncertainty, torn between the needs of a friend and the demands of my vocation."}
