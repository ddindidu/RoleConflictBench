As I settled in, my phone buzzed with a message from my neighbor, Mrs. Lee. She was expecting an important package today but had to rush out for an emergency. She asked if I could receive it for her, knowing I\u2019d be home. I wanted to help; we always look out for each other, and I knew how much she relied on me for these small favors.\n\nBut then I remembered: the delivery person could arrive at any moment, and I wasn\u2019t dressed modestly according to my faith. If I answered the door like this, I\u2019d be going against my own values. Yet, if I took the time to change every time the doorbell rang, I might miss the delivery altogether. I felt torn\u2014wanting to be a good neighbor, but also wanting to honor my religious commitment. The tension built inside me as I paced the living room, glancing at the clock, waiting for the doorbell, unsure what I would do when it finally rang."}
