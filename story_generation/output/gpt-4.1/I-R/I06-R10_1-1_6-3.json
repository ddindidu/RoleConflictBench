The hallway was quiet except for the low hum of conversation from inside. I glanced at my watch, rehearsing the questions I wanted to ask, determined not to waste her time. Just then, I noticed a colleague slip ahead of me, pretending not to see the line. My heart thudded. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, even in small matters. But as a mentee, I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene or disrupt the flow of my mentor\u2019s carefully scheduled time. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014one urging me to speak up, the other to stay silent and respectful. My palms grew clammy as I wrestled with what to do, caught between honoring my mentor\u2019s time and my own sense of dharma."}
