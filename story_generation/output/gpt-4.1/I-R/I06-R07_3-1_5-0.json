My teammates\u2019 arguments had escalated again, and our project deadline was slipping through my fingers. I knew I should reach out, explain the situation, ask for guidance\u2014my mentor always said honesty and communication were key. But as I typed, the temple bell echoed through the evening air, a gentle reminder that the community chant would begin soon. As a Buddhist, I was expected to join, to be present with my sangha, to let go of worldly worries and cultivate peace. My heart pounded with anxiety. If I missed the chant, I\u2019d disappoint my teacher and the community, betraying the values I tried so hard to embody. But if I stayed silent about the project, I\u2019d let my mentor down, and maybe even jeopardize my future. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, unsure which path to follow as the minutes slipped away."}
