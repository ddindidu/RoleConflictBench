The workshop was tomorrow, and as pastor, I was expected to lead with clarity and conviction, guiding our community leaders through dense theological material. My notes were scattered across the desk, but my mind kept drifting to the living room, where my boyfriend sat in silence, eyes red from crying. His father had passed away just two days ago, and he needed me\u2014his girlfriend\u2014to hold him, to listen, to simply be there. I could hear his quiet sobs, and guilt twisted in my chest. I wanted to drop everything, to wrap him in my arms and let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. But the church was counting on me, too. They needed my focus, my wisdom, my presence. I felt torn in two, pulled by love and duty, unable to give either the attention they deserved. My heart ached as I stared at the closed door, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
