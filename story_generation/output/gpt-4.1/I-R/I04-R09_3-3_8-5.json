My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my friend, still upset from my careless comment earlier. I knew I should call, apologize, and talk it through right away, just like we always promised each other. But the event was about to start, and everyone was gathering for the meal. The only food available wasn\u2019t kosher, and I could already feel the eyes of my community on me, expecting me to uphold our shared values. My stomach twisted with guilt and hunger. If I stepped out to call my friend, I\u2019d miss the meal and draw attention to myself. If I stayed, I\u2019d have to either eat food I wasn\u2019t comfortable with or refuse and risk offending the hosts. My friend needed me, but so did my community and my own sense of faith. I gripped my phone, torn between the two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
