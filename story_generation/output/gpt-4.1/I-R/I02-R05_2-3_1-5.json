My partner sat beside me, eyes red, shoulders slumped. She\u2019d just come home, voice trembling as she recounted the harsh words from her boss. I wanted to hold her, to listen, to reassure her that she was more than her job, that I was here for her. But my mind kept drifting to the clock. In twenty minutes, I was supposed to meet with Daniel, the conversion candidate. This was his last study session before the Beit Din\u2014he was nervous, desperate for guidance, and I was the one he trusted to help him prepare. I could hear the weight in my partner\u2019s silence, feel the urgency in Daniel\u2019s texts. I was torn, heart pulled in two directions, each role demanding my full presence. I wanted to be the boyfriend she needed, the rabbi he counted on. My hands shook as I tried to decide which promise to keep, feeling the ache of letting someone down, no matter what I chose."}
