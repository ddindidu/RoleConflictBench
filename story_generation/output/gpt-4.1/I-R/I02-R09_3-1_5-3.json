It\u2019s our last weekend together before she leaves for months, and I want every moment to count. She smiles, holding up a bag of her favorite takeout\u2014her way of making our night special. But as she opens the containers, the familiar scent tells me it\u2019s not kosher. She doesn\u2019t notice, chatting about her new city, her excitement contagious. I nod, but my mind races. I want to be the boyfriend who says yes, who shares her favorite meal, who makes this night perfect. But I also feel the tug of my Jewish identity, the comfort and commitment of keeping kosher, especially when it would be so easy to stick to the snacks and ingredients I know are okay. She looks at me, waiting for me to join her, and I feel the pressure building\u2014between honoring my faith and making her feel loved, between who I am and who I want to be for her."}
