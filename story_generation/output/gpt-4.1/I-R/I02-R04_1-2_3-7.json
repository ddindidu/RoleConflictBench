I miss you.\u201d We\u2019d both been so busy, but finally, our schedules lined up. I could almost hear her laughter, feel the warmth of her hand in mine. I wanted to give her my full attention, to be the boyfriend she deserved\u2014present, caring, and attentive.\n\nBut then, another message arrived. This one was from Brother Ahmed, a pillar of our mosque. \u201cImam, can we meet soon? My family is going through a lot. I really need your guidance.\u201d His words carried a weight I couldn\u2019t ignore. As imam, I was expected to be there for my community, to offer counsel and comfort, especially in times of crisis.\n\nI felt the tension coil in my chest. Both roles demanded my time, my empathy, my presence. I wanted to be there for her, to nurture our relationship. But I also couldn\u2019t turn away from someone in need. My mind raced, torn between love and duty, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
