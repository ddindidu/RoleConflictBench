She wanted advice about choosing between two internships, both good options, and I knew she expected my usual, thoughtful guidance. I started typing a response, but my mind kept drifting to the upcoming holiday. At home, my own children were waiting for me to teach them the blessings and stories they needed to know before the celebration. I could picture their eager faces, the candles, the songs\u2014traditions I was responsible for passing down. The weight of both roles pressed on me: my mentee needed my attention, but so did my children. I felt torn, knowing that if I focused on one, I\u2019d be letting the other down. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my heart caught between the demands of being a mentor and the expectations of being a Jewish parent."}
