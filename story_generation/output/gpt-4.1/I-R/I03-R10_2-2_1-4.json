He\u2019d just told me about the harsh feedback from his boss, and I could feel his disappointment radiating off him. As his girlfriend, I knew he needed me to listen, to reassure him, to be his safe space. I reached for his hand, but before I could say anything, I noticed our friend Priya across the path, her voice trembling as she argued with another colleague. It was clear she was being blamed for something she hadn\u2019t done. My heart twisted\u2014my Hindu values taught me to stand up for what\u2019s right, to not turn away from injustice. But Arjun\u2019s pain pulled at me, silently begging for my attention. I felt torn, my mind racing between the urge to comfort him and the duty to defend Priya. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, leaving me frozen, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
