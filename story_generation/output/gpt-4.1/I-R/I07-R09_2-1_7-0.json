They needed my input to move forward on the project, and I knew everyone was waiting. As a colleague, I prided myself on being responsive and reliable, always making sure no one was left hanging. But tonight was the weekly study slot I\u2019d promised my kids\u2014a time set aside to teach them about our Jewish traditions, to share stories and values that I hoped would shape their lives. I could technically move the lesson to another night, but I\u2019d already shifted it twice this month, and I worried about what that signaled to my children. Was I showing them that work always came first? Yet, if I ignored my team now, I\u2019d be letting them down, too. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, my phone buzzing insistently in my hand as my kids waited in the next room, eager for our lesson."}
