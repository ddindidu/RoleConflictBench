Why didn\u2019t you tell me about the class?\u201d I can almost hear the disappointment in her words. As her boyfriend, I know I should call her, talk it through, and reassure her that she matters most. We\u2019ve had a few misunderstandings lately, and I promised I\u2019d be more attentive.\n\nBut as a rabbi, I also feel the tug of responsibility. The adult education class isn\u2019t mandatory, but I know several congregants look forward to it. They trust me to guide them, to answer their questions, to be present. Canceling last minute feels unprofessional, even if it\u2019s just a drop-in session.\n\nI pace the hallway, phone in hand, torn between the urge to dial Maya and the knowledge that I should be preparing my notes. My mind races with the expectations pressing in from both sides\u2014Maya\u2019s need for reassurance, my community\u2019s need for leadership. I close my eyes, wishing I could be in two places at once, feeling the weight of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
