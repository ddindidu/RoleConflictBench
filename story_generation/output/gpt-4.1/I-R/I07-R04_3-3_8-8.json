I glanced at the screen\u2014three new emails from my manager, all marked urgent. The leadership team needed my confirmation on a project detail for an external partner, and they expected a prompt reply. I knew how important it was to be responsive, to show reliability as a colleague. \n\nJust then, the door creaked open. A community member stepped in, eyes red and shoulders slumped. He barely managed a greeting before breaking down, sharing that he\u2019d just lost his father. As the imam, I was expected to offer comfort, to listen and guide him through his grief. He needed me, right now, to be fully present. \n\nMy mind raced. If I paused to counsel him, I\u2019d risk missing the window for the work reply, letting my team down. But if I excused myself to answer emails, I\u2019d be abandoning someone in deep pain. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my undivided attention, and I sat there, torn, heart pounding, unable to move."}
