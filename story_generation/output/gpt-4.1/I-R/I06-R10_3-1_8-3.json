My mentor had squeezed in this session just before catching a flight, and I knew how precious every minute was. I wanted to make the most of it, to show respect for her time and dedication. As we walked toward the meeting room, I noticed a colleague quietly slipping ahead in the coffee line, bypassing others who\u2019d been waiting. It was a small thing, but my upbringing as a Hindu pressed on me\u2014the importance of dharma, of standing up for what\u2019s right, even in small matters. My mind raced: should I speak up, risking an awkward delay and possibly wasting my mentor\u2019s limited time? Or should I stay silent, letting the moment pass, but feeling I\u2019d failed my own ethical standards? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I felt caught in the middle, uncertain which path to choose."}
