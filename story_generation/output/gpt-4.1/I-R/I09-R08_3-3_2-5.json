Today was Friday, and I was on my way to the main prayer hall for Jumu\u2019ah, a time when I felt most connected to my faith. Just as I was about to leave, I saw a group of neighbors gathered near the elevator, their voices low and tense. The noise complaint had finally come to a head, and they wanted to talk face-to-face. \n\nAs a neighbor, I knew I should greet them warmly, listen politely, and help ease the tension. But I also felt the pressure of time\u2014Jumu\u2019ah was about to begin, and I couldn\u2019t be late. My heart pounded as I realized my modest attire, so normal in the mosque, might seem out of place or even draw attention in this setting. I worried about being judged or misunderstood, but I also didn\u2019t want to seem unfriendly or dismissive. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I hesitated, caught between the pull of my faith and the demands of being a good neighbor."}
