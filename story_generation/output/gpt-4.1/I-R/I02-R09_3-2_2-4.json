She hasn\u2019t eaten all day, and I know she needs comfort, something warm and familiar. My mind races\u2014she\u2019s grieving, and I want to be there for her, to do anything that might ease her pain. We pass bustling restaurants, the smell of fresh bread and roasting meat drifting out, but I know none of them are kosher. The only kosher vendor is a tiny stand blocks away, and it\u2019s closing soon. She stops in front of a caf\u00e9, looking at me hopefully, her voice barely above a whisper, \u201cCan we just go in here?\u201d I see the longing in her face, the exhaustion. My heart aches\u2014I want to say yes, to sit with her, to let her feel cared for. But my upbringing, my commitment to keeping kosher, tugs at me. I feel torn, guilt rising no matter which way I lean. I squeeze her hand, searching her face, wishing the answer could be simple."}
