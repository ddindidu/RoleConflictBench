The deadline was weeks away, but I knew my mentor valued initiative\u2014he\u2019d hinted that those who finished early often got more out of the program. I wanted to impress him, to show I was serious about my growth. But as I reached for the first article, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series was in an hour. As a priest, I was expected to lead, to come prepared with ideas and a vision for the coming season. The parish counted on me to inspire and organize, especially now, when so many were seeking guidance. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my mentor\u2019s silent expectations on one side, my parish\u2019s needs on the other. My mind raced, torn between the desire to excel as a mentee and the responsibility to shepherd my community. I stared at the clock, heart pounding, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both my best at the same time."}
