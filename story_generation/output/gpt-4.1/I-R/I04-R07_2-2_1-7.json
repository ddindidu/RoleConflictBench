I glanced at the screen\u2014Maya. Her voice trembled when I answered, and she barely got out, \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now.\u201d I could hear the strain in her words, the kind that comes after a fight that shakes your sense of self. As her friend, I knew what she needed: someone to listen, to hold space for her pain, to reassure her she wasn\u2019t alone. But tonight was also the one evening a week I set aside for spiritual study, a commitment I\u2019d made to myself and my sangha. We were discussing a chapter I hadn\u2019t yet read, and I\u2019d promised to contribute. The teachings always left me feeling centered, but I also knew how much Maya relied on me in moments like this. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the quiet promise of reflection and the urgent need of a friend. I sat there, phone pressed to my ear, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which path to follow."}
