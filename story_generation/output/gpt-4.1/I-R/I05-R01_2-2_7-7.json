On one side, my mentee\u2019s resume and a list of potential interview questions for the promotion she desperately wanted. She\u2019d confided in me about her ambition, her fears, and her willingness to do whatever it took to succeed. As her mentor, I felt the weight of her trust, the expectation to help her grow, to push her toward her goals\u2014even if it meant encouraging her to be assertive, to negotiate hard, to put herself first.\n\nOn the other side, my open Bible and the beginnings of my Sunday sermon. This week\u2019s passage was about humility, about serving others before oneself, about the dangers of pride. As a pastor, I was expected to guide my congregation toward selflessness, to remind them that true greatness comes from putting others first.\n\nI stared at the two sets of notes, feeling the tension coil in my chest. How could I encourage my mentee to fight for her own advancement while preparing to preach about humility and self-sacrifice? The expectations pulled me in opposite directions, and I found myself caught in the middle, unsure which voice to follow."}
