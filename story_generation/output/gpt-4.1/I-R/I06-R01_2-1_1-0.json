The deadline was in three days, and I knew he expected nothing less than my best effort. Every keystroke reminded me of his words: \u201cTake your time, but make sure it\u2019s thorough.\u201d I wanted to prove myself, to show I was worthy of his guidance.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and tonight she sounded especially lost. As her pastor, I felt the weight of her pain, the unspoken expectation that I would be there, offering comfort and spiritual guidance. I could almost hear her voice trembling, needing reassurance, needing me.\n\nMy mind raced. If I paused my coding, I might fall behind and disappoint my mentor. If I ignored Sarah, I\u2019d fail her in her moment of need. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the code and the call for help, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
