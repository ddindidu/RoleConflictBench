She needed me\u2014her boyfriend\u2014to listen, to hold her, to reassure her that she was more than her boss\u2019s words. My phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Carter, a parishioner. She wanted to know if I could meet soon, just to talk. She didn\u2019t say why, but I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately. As a priest, I was expected to be available, to offer comfort and guidance whenever someone reached out. Anna\u2019s hand gripped mine, her silent plea for support clear. But Mrs. Carter\u2019s message lingered in my mind, a reminder of my duty to my congregation. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest. Anna needed me now, but so did Mrs. Carter, in her own way. I stared at my phone, heart pounding, caught between the person I loved and the people I served, unsure which need should come first."}
