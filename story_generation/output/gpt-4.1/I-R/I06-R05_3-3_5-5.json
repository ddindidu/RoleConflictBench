My mentor\u2019s message blinked at me: \u201cLet me know if you hit any roadblocks.\u201d I had hit a wall, all right\u2014my teammates were at each other\u2019s throats, and our project was unraveling fast. I knew I should reach out, explain the mess, ask for guidance. That\u2019s what a good mentee does: communicate, don\u2019t hide problems.\n\nBut the clock was ticking toward the hour I\u2019d promised to meet Miriam, my conversion student. Her Beit Din was tomorrow, and tonight\u2019s session was crucial. She was anxious, desperate for reassurance and clarity. As her rabbi, I was her anchor, her guide through the maze of Jewish law and tradition. Canceling or rescheduling now would shake her confidence, maybe even her resolve.\n\nMy mind spun with guilt and worry. If I focused on my mentee role, I\u2019d let Miriam down at her most vulnerable moment. If I kept my rabbinic commitment, I\u2019d be failing my mentor\u2019s trust and my team\u2019s deadline. I felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, and I couldn\u2019t see a way to honor both."}
