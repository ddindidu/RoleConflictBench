My mentee sat across from me, eyes wide with anxiety as she described the critical task she\u2019d been assigned\u2014one where a single misstep could ripple out with serious consequences. She needed my full attention, my experience, my guidance. I could see her searching my face for reassurance, for the knowledge I was expected to share. Yet, in less than ten minutes, I was supposed to lead our weekly group meditation, a commitment I\u2019d made not just to others, but to my own Buddhist practice. The group would be gathering soon, expecting me to guide them into stillness, to embody mindfulness and presence. My mind raced, torn between the urgent needs of my mentee and the quiet sanctuary of the meditation hall. I felt the tension coil in my chest\u2014how could I be both the steady mentor she needed and the mindful leader my sangha expected? The clock ticked on, and I sat, caught between two worlds, uncertain which call to answer."}
