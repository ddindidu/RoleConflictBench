He thinks I was being sarcastic, and his words are clipped, hurt. I know I should call him right now, clear things up before the misunderstanding grows. That\u2019s what a good friend does\u2014communicates, doesn\u2019t let things fester. But I\u2019m standing in a busy train station, stomach growling, and I know I have only a few minutes before my train leaves. The only food vendor nearby is the little kosher stand tucked in the corner, and if I don\u2019t get something now, I\u2019ll be stuck for hours with nothing to eat. I can\u2019t eat just anything; keeping kosher isn\u2019t just a preference, it\u2019s a commitment I\u2019ve made to myself and my faith. My hand hovers over my phone, torn between dialing Sam and rushing to the vendor before the line grows. The pressure builds in my chest\u2014do I risk my friend\u2019s trust or my own religious integrity? I stand frozen, caught between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in."}
