My manager\u2019s reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need this by tomorrow morning. The client\u2019s waiting.\u201d I knew the project\u2019s timeline hinged on my part, and any delay would ripple through the team. Yet, tonight was also the community Quran study circle, a gathering I cherished. We were set to discuss verses I hadn\u2019t yet read, let alone reflected on. As a Muslim, I felt a deep responsibility to engage with the Quran, not just for myself but as part of my commitment to the group. The thought of showing up unprepared filled me with guilt, but so did the idea of letting my colleagues down. My phone buzzed with a reminder for the study circle, and I felt my chest tighten. I wanted to be present for both, but the hours were slipping away, and I knew I couldn\u2019t give my best to either role. The pressure built inside me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I sat frozen, torn between my faith and my work."}
