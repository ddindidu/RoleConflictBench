She\u2019d misunderstood my joke, and now she was hurt. As her friend, I knew I should call her right away, clear things up, and make sure she knew I\u2019d never mean to upset her. That\u2019s what good friends do\u2014communicate, don\u2019t let things fester.\n\nBut it was almost sunset, and I hadn\u2019t eaten since lunch. I was supposed to have dinner before the fast began, and I needed to make sure everything I ate was kosher. The pantry was full of kosher snacks, but I\u2019d have to prepare something quickly, say the right blessings, and eat before the window closed. If I called Maya now, I might miss my chance to eat, and I\u2019d be hungry and distracted all night. If I waited, she might think I didn\u2019t care. My phone buzzed again. I stood frozen, torn between my friend\u2019s pain and my commitment to my faith, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
