My manager\u2019s reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need this by five, or the whole team will be set back.\u201d I knew how much my work mattered\u2014if I missed the deadline, it would throw off everyone, especially Sarah, who depended on my numbers to finish her part. But then my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mark, a friend from church. He sounded desperate, saying he was struggling and needed someone to talk to. I remembered the words from last Sunday\u2019s sermon: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d I felt the weight of that expectation, the call to be present for someone in need, to show kindness and compassion. My heart ached for Mark, but my mind raced with the consequences of letting my team down. I sat frozen, torn between the urgent needs of my workplace and the deeper call to care for a friend in pain, feeling the tension pull me in two directions at once."}
