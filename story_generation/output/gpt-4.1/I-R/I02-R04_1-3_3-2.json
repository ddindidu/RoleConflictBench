Any evening works for me!\u201d My heart leapt. We\u2019d both been so busy, and I knew how much it meant to her that we spend time together, just the two of us, away from the noise of our routines. I started to type a reply, but then the mosque committee\u2019s call came through. There was a special remembrance gathering tonight, and the usual imam was out of town. No one else was authorized to lead the prayers. They needed me.\n\nI stared at the prayer schedule and then at Sara\u2019s message. The mosque was already filling up, the community expecting guidance and presence. But Sara\u2019s hope for a quiet evening together echoed in my mind. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest\u2014my duty to my faith and community, and my promise to be present for the woman I love. My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between two lives, each demanding all of me, and I didn\u2019t know which to choose."}
