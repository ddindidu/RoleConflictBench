As a nun, these moments of spiritual study and reflection are not just a comfort, but a necessity, a way to stay rooted in my faith and purpose. Yet, just as I settled onto the wooden bench, my phone buzzed. It was Maria, my mentee, her message urgent: she was stuck on her project, overwhelmed and unsure, asking if I could talk. As her mentor, I know how much she relies on my guidance, how my regular check-ins and feedback have become her lifeline through this difficult time. I could almost hear her anxiety in the text, and I felt the weight of her expectation pressing against the quiet I so desperately craved. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the peace of contemplation and the call to help. I sat there, phone in hand, torn between the silence I needed and the support she needed, feeling the tension coil inside me, unresolved."}
