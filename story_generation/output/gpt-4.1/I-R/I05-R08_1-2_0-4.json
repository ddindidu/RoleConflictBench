My mentee, Sarah, had just left my office, her eyes bright with hope after I\u2019d reassured her about her project. As a mentor, I knew I should be present at the function, ready to offer guidance and encouragement, especially since Sarah had confided in me about her nerves around networking. But as a Muslim, I felt the familiar weight of expectation settle on my shoulders. The dress code was vague, but I knew from past events that \u201csmart casual\u201d often meant attire that didn\u2019t align with my standards of modesty\u2014long sleeves, loose clothing, and a headscarf.\n\nI opened my closet, fingers brushing over my usual work outfits.
