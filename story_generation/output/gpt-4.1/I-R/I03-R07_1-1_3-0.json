Any evening works for me.\u201d My heart fluttered. We hadn\u2019t had much time together lately, and I knew how much it meant to him\u2014and to me\u2014to reconnect, to laugh over dinner, to just be us. I started to type a reply, but then my phone buzzed again. This time, it was a reminder from the temple: \u201cEvening chant every night this week. Your presence supports the sangha.\u201d\n\nI stared at the screen, feeling a knot tighten in my chest. The temple was my spiritual home, and the evening chants were more than routine\u2014they were a commitment to my practice and my community. I knew the monks and my fellow practitioners counted on me, and I felt a deep responsibility not to let them down. But I also knew how much my boyfriend looked forward to our time together, how he\u2019d been hoping for a special evening just for us. I wanted to be present for both, but the expectations pulled me in opposite directions, leaving me torn and anxious, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
