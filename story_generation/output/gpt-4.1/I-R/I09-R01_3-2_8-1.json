With the power outage, I\u2019m worried about things getting left outside.\u201d I assured her I\u2019d help, knowing how much she relied on me for these little neighborly favors. As soon as she left, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Daniel, a church member. He was waiting at the church, desperate to talk about a decision that could change his life. He needed my full attention and spiritual guidance, and I knew these conversations could last hours. I glanced at the clock, realizing the power interruption was scheduled to start soon. If I left now, I might miss the delivery Mrs. Kim was so anxious about. But if I stayed, Daniel would be left alone in his moment of crisis. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one expecting simple, practical help, the other needing deep, undivided care. My heart raced as I stood in the hallway, torn between being the neighbor Mrs. Kim counted on and the pastor Daniel needed."}
