This afternoon was meant for quiet reflection, a rare pause in the rhythm of the convent. I had been looking forward to this time all week, to lose myself in scripture and prayer, to listen for God\u2019s voice in the silence. Just as I settled in, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Anna, my closest friend from before I took my vows. Her reply was curt, her words sharp with hurt. She had misunderstood my earlier text, reading impatience where I meant only brevity. I knew Anna\u2014she would be stewing, feeling abandoned. As her friend, I should call her now, explain, reassure her that I care. But as a nun, I am called to this sacred quiet, to set aside worldly concerns and focus on my spiritual growth. My heart twisted, torn between the gentle pull of friendship and the solemn promise of devotion. The phone felt heavy in my hand, the silence around me suddenly thick with expectation."}
