The project deadline loomed, and I knew how much they depended on me to guide them through the final hurdles. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of the appointment I\u2019d promised to keep as a priest. Maria, a gentle soul from the congregation, was coming in half an hour, seeking counsel for a struggle she\u2019d hinted at in last Sunday\u2019s service. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. My mentees needed my expertise, my structure, my presence to help them succeed. But Maria needed my compassion, my listening ear, my spiritual guidance. I glanced at the clock, heart pounding, torn between the duty to share my knowledge and the call to offer comfort. Both expected my full attention, both deserved it. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the tension coil tighter within me as the minutes slipped away."}
