It was Sam, my closest friend, his voice tight with panic. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. I\u2019m almost at the airport\u2014can you check and bring it if it\u2019s there? Please, I\u2019ll miss my flight otherwise.\u201d I glanced at the clock. If I left now, I could just make it to the airport, but I\u2019d have to skip the soup kitchen, where I\u2019d promised to help serve dinner. As a Christian, I try to live out Jesus\u2019 teachings, showing kindness to strangers and being there for those in need. The people at the soup kitchen count on me, and I know how much a warm meal and a smile can mean. But Sam is my friend, and he\u2019s in real trouble. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the urgent call of friendship and my commitment to serve others with love."}
