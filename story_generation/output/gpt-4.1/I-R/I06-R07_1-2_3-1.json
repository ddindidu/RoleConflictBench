The question about terminology nags at me, but it\u2019s not urgent\u2014just a small uncertainty. Still, I remember my mentor\u2019s words: \u201cLet me know if you\u2019re ever unsure, even about little things.\u201d I want to show I\u2019m engaged and responsible, not someone who lets confusion fester. But tonight is the memorial service at the temple. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to be there, to chant and offer incense with the community. The abbot mentioned how important it is for everyone to attend, especially for those of us who are younger. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in. If I email my mentor now, I\u2019ll be late to the service, and if I wait, I\u2019ll be ignoring the advice to communicate promptly. My mind spins with guilt and anxiety, torn between being a diligent mentee and a devoted Buddhist. I close my eyes, wishing I could be in two places at once, heart pounding as I try to decide what to do."}
