The sermon for Sunday weighed on my mind\u2014this week, I was supposed to guide the congregation through the complexities of forgiveness and faith in times of hardship. But in the next room, I could hear my girlfriend\u2019s quiet sobs. She had just lost her brother, and her grief was raw, overwhelming. As her boyfriend, I wanted nothing more than to hold her, to listen, to simply be there. But as a pastor, I felt the pressure to craft words that would help dozens of others find meaning in their own pain. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cSermon draft due tonight.\u201d I stared at the screen, guilt gnawing at me. If I left her alone, I\u2019d feel like I was failing her. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my congregation. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I found myself paralyzed, torn between the person she needed and the leader my church expected."}
