The main weekly service was in less than an hour, and I needed to prepare. But as I set my bag down, I saw her on the couch, shoulders slumped, eyes fixed on nothing. She tried to smile, but it didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, sitting beside her. She nodded, and I could feel the weight she carried, the silent plea for comfort. My instinct as her boyfriend was to stay, to listen, to hold her until the tension melted away. But the church bells echoed in my mind, reminding me of the congregation waiting, the prayers I was expected to lead. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014one by love, the other by duty. I wanted to be everything for her, but I also couldn\u2019t let down the community that relied on me. The minutes ticked by, and I sat there, wrestling with the impossible choice between the woman I loved and the calling I had promised to serve."}
