The group\u2019s laughter grew sharper, and I felt the familiar pressure to join in, to be part of the camaraderie. As an acquaintance, I knew the unspoken rule: don\u2019t be the odd one out, but also don\u2019t speak ill of others. My silence felt heavy, but so did the urge to fit in.\n\nAt the same time, my mind wandered to my son at home, struggling with his Torah portion for his upcoming bar mitzvah. As a Jewish parent, I was expected to guide him, to instill in him the values of kindness, respect, and the importance of our traditions. I worried I wasn\u2019t doing enough, that my own example\u2014right here, right now\u2014might fall short of what I hoped to teach him.\n\nCaught between the group\u2019s expectations and my own responsibilities as a Jewish parent, I felt the tension knot in my chest. I wanted to be true to both roles, but the demands seemed to pull me in opposite directions."}
