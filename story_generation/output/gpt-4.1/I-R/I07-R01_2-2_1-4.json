My inbox pinged with a reminder: \u201cToday\u2019s meeting is crucial. Please be present and engaged.\u201d I knew the project updates would be detailed, and missing them meant falling behind. As I gathered my notes, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. \u201cCan you talk? It\u2019s urgent. I don\u2019t know who else to turn to.\u201d My heart tightened. She\u2019d been struggling for weeks, and I\u2019d promised to be there whenever she needed support. I stared at the meeting invite, then at Sarah\u2019s message. My colleagues expected me to be a reliable teammate, present and attentive. But as a pastor, I was someone\u2019s lifeline in a moment of crisis. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. I felt torn, caught between the needs of my team and the needs of my community, unsure which call to answer first."}
