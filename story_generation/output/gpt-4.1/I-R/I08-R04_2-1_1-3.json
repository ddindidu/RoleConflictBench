As an acquaintance, I felt the urge to approach him, to offer a warm smile and gentle conversation, to make him feel welcome in this unfamiliar place. I knew how much a friendly word could mean to someone who felt out of place. Yet, as the imam, I was expected to prepare for the Friday sermon, to focus my mind and spirit, and to be ready to deliver words of guidance to the congregation. The guest speaker was present and could take the pulpit if I asked, but many in the community expected me to lead. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the anxious newcomer who needed a friend, and toward the pulpit where my presence was anticipated. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my attention, each carrying its own sense of responsibility. I hesitated, torn between the warmth of a welcoming gesture and the solemn duty of spiritual leadership, unsure which path to choose."}
