It\u2019s a mess. I don\u2019t know how he keeps his job.\u201d I felt a familiar discomfort rise in my chest. As an acquaintance, I knew I should avoid gossiping or speaking negatively about others, but Miriam\u2019s expectant gaze lingered, waiting for my response. At the same time, the Shabbat service was only a day away, and as the rabbi, I was expected to prepare a sermon that would inspire and guide the community. My mind raced with ideas about kindness and the dangers of lashon hara\u2014evil speech\u2014but I worried that addressing gossip in my sermon might seem like a direct rebuke to Miriam, or worse, that I was using the pulpit to settle personal discomforts. I felt torn between the urge to gently redirect the conversation and the pressure to craft a meaningful message for Shabbat, all while wrestling with the fear of alienating someone in the congregation. The weight of these conflicting expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, unsure of what to say next."}
