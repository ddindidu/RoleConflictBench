At the same time, my girlfriend paced the living room, her voice trembling as she questioned whether we could even stay together after our latest argument. She needed me\u2014needed us\u2014to talk, to resolve this, to prove that I cared enough to fight for us. But the church expected me to be present, calm, and prepared for the children and their parents, who relied on me for guidance and stability. My heart pounded as I tried to listen to her pain, but my mind kept drifting to the lesson plan I hadn\u2019t finished. I felt torn in two, desperate not to let anyone down, but knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting, hurt, or disappointed."}
