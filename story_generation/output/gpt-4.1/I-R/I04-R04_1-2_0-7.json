First, a message from Amir: \u201cMan, today was endless. Just need someone to talk to.\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in his words. As his friend, I knew he counted on me to listen, to be there, to help him shake off the weight of his day. Before I could reply, another message appeared\u2014this one from Sister Layla, a respected member of our congregation. \u201cImam, could we meet soon? I\u2019m struggling with family issues and need your guidance.\u201d Her words carried urgency, the kind that made me feel the gravity of my role as imam.\n\nI stared at the screen, feeling the pressure build in my chest. Amir needed a friend, someone to listen without judgment. Layla needed an imam, someone to offer wisdom and comfort. Both expected my full attention, my empathy, my time. I wanted to be there for both, but I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My mind raced, torn between the quiet loyalty of friendship and the sacred duty of spiritual care. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, wishing I could split myself in two."}
