My neighbor, Mrs. Rahman, always appreciated when I waited until the bins were full before dragging them out, so we didn\u2019t clutter the curb or attract stray cats. As her neighbor, I wanted to respect our unspoken agreement about shared spaces and boundaries. But my phone buzzed with a message from Brother Yusuf, a long-time congregant. He sounded desperate, asking if I could meet him tonight\u2014he was overwhelmed by family troubles and needed spiritual guidance. As the imam, I felt a deep responsibility to be there for him, to offer comfort and counsel when he needed it most. I glanced at the bins again, feeling the weight of both roles pressing on me. If I left now to meet Yusuf, I\u2019d have to put the bins out early, risking Mrs. Rahman\u2019s annoyance. If I waited, I might miss the chance to help someone in real distress. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between being a good neighbor and a compassionate imam, unsure which duty should come first."}
