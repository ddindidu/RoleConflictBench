Just an hour ago, I\u2019d made a careless joke at lunch, and now I\u2019d learned it had really hurt Priya. As her friend, I knew I should call her immediately, apologize, and try to fix things before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014communicate, clear the air, and make things right.\n\nBut as I reached for my phone, I saw something out the window: our neighbor, Mr. Sharma, was taking bribes from a delivery man, right in front of his shop. I froze. As a Hindu, I\u2019ve always been taught to stand up for dharma, to act with integrity and not turn a blind eye to wrongdoing. My conscience screamed at me to intervene, to report what I\u2019d seen, to do the right thing.\n\nI felt torn in two. My friend needed me now, but so did my sense of moral duty. Both roles demanded immediate action, but I couldn\u2019t do both at once. My hands shook as I stood between the phone and the window, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
