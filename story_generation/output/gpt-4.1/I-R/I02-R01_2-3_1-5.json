She\u2019d just gotten off the phone with her boss, the words \u201cnot good enough\u201d echoing in her mind. I wanted nothing more than to hold her, to reassure her that she was more than her job, to be the boyfriend she needed right now. My phone buzzed insistently on the coffee table. It was the church deacon, his message urgent: a family in our congregation had lost their home in a fire, and they needed me to organize support and offer comfort immediately. My heart twisted. I could see the pain in my partner\u2019s eyes, her need for me to be present, to listen, to care. But I also felt the weight of my calling, the expectation that I would be there for my community in their darkest hour. I stared at my phone, torn between the woman I loved and the people who depended on me, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
