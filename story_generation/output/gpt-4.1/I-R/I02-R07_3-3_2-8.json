She had just lost her father, and the apartment felt heavy with her grief. I wanted to hold her, to listen, to be the steady presence she needed. But the teachings called to me too\u2014my teacher\u2019s trust, the community\u2019s expectation, the discipline I\u2019d promised myself to uphold. My mind raced between the two worlds: the quiet, contemplative space of the Dharma, and the raw, immediate pain in the room. I felt torn, guilt rising no matter which way I leaned. If I left her side, I\u2019d feel heartless. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down my teacher and my own spiritual path.
