The team meeting at work was scheduled for 10 a.m.\u2014the same time as the main weekly service at the church. As a colleague, I was expected to show up, contribute, and be present, even if the meeting was just a routine catch-up. My manager always said participation mattered, even if the session would be recorded. But as a priest, I knew the community counted on me to lead the prayers, to be the steady presence at the heart of our weekly gathering. Missing the service would mean letting down people who looked to me for guidance and comfort. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my presence, each expecting my full attention. My mind raced with possible excuses, compromises, and the fear of disappointing someone, no matter what I chose. I sat at my desk, hands trembling, torn between the call of my colleagues and the call of my congregation, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
