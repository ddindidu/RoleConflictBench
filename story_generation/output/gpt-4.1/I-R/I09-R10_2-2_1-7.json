My mother always said that being a good neighbor meant being friendly and polite, so I baked a small cake to share with the people next door. As I was about to leave for my cousin\u2019s upanayanam ceremony\u2014a sacred thread ritual that my family had been planning for weeks\u2014I saw Mrs. Sharma, my neighbor, coming up the stairs. She smiled warmly, and I realized this was the perfect moment to introduce myself and offer the cake. But I glanced at my watch; the ceremony was about to start, and I still needed to change into my kurta and get to the temple on time. I felt a knot in my stomach. If I stopped to chat and share the cake, I\u2019d be late for the ceremony, disappointing my family and disrespecting the tradition. But if I rushed past Mrs. Sharma, I\u2019d seem rude and unfriendly, failing as a good neighbor. I stood there, cake in hand, heart pounding, torn between two worlds that both mattered deeply to me."}
