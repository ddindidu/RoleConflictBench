My manager had emphasized how crucial my part was\u2014if I missed the deadline, the whole project would stall, and the client would be left waiting. I felt the weight of my colleagues\u2019 expectations, knowing they were counting on me to keep everything moving. But just below that reminder was another: the weekly study session with my kids. Every Thursday evening, I gathered them around the table to teach them about our Jewish heritage\u2014stories, songs, and the values that shaped our family. It was a promise I made to myself, to pass on what my parents gave me. I knew I could reschedule the lesson, but I also knew how much it meant to my children, how much it meant to me. The thought of letting down my team gnawed at me, but so did the idea of breaking that sacred time with my kids. I sat there, torn, the demands of my work and my faith pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
