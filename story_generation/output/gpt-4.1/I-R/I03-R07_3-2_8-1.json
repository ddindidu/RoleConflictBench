Our argument from earlier still hangs in the air, sharp and unresolved. He wants to talk, to find some way through the anger and doubt, and I know he expects me to be present, to help us heal before things fall apart completely. But tonight is the memorial service at the temple\u2014a gathering I promised to attend weeks ago. The community expects me there, to chant, to offer incense, to support those grieving. My teacher always says that presence is a form of compassion, and I believe it. Yet, my heart aches with the weight of my boyfriend\u2019s words, the fear that if I leave now, I might return to find us broken beyond repair. I stare at my robes folded neatly on the chair, feeling torn between the peace I seek at the temple and the turmoil waiting in the next room. My hands tremble as I try to decide which part of myself to honor tonight."}
