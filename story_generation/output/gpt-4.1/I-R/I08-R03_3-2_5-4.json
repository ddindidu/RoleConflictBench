It was Anna, an old friend from town. Her voice trembled through the speaker, \u201cMy car broke down on the old Mill Road. Can you come? I don\u2019t know who else to call.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014if I left now, I\u2019d barely make it to the service, which Mother Superior had emphasized was vital for our ailing sister. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to pray and support my community, especially during such a rare and important gathering. But Anna sounded desperate, and as her acquaintance, I knew she had no family nearby. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: the sacred duty to my sisters, the compassion owed to a friend in need. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the chapel\u2019s call and the echo of Anna\u2019s plea, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
