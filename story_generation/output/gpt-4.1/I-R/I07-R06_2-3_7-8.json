They were waiting for my clarification on the project details before moving forward, and I knew everyone was anxious to wrap things up before the weekend. As a colleague, I felt the pressure to respond quickly, to be reliable and efficient. But just as I was about to type my reply, I noticed a coworker sitting alone in the break room, head in hands, quietly crying. I remembered the teachings of Jesus\u2014how important it is to show love and kindness, especially when someone is hurting. I felt torn. If I stopped to comfort her, I\u2019d delay my response and possibly frustrate the team. But if I ignored her pain, I\u2019d be turning away from the compassion my faith calls me to show. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, caught between the urgent demands of my job and the deeper call to care for someone in need."}
