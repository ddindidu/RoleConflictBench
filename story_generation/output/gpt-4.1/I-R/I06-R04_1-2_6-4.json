My mentor\u2019s office hours overlapped with the time I was supposed to deliver the Friday sermon. As a mentee, I knew how much my mentor valued punctuality and commitment\u2014he\u2019d made it clear that office hours were for us, and he expected us to show up, prepared and engaged. I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him or seem ungrateful for his guidance.\n\nBut as the imam, I was the only one scheduled to give the Khutbah this week. The community had already announced my topic, and people were looking forward to it. I could picture the congregation gathering, waiting for words of guidance and inspiration. Missing the sermon would let down so many, and it wasn\u2019t something I could easily reschedule or delegate.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed on me. I felt torn, anxious, and guilty, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down. My mind raced, searching for a solution, but the clock kept ticking, and the decision loomed closer."}
