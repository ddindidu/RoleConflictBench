As her mentor, I knew how much this meant for her career, and I wanted to give her my full attention, to encourage her, to help her grow. But as she spoke, my mind drifted to the time\u2014I was already late for my daily puja. My family had always taught me the importance of honoring my Hindu rituals, of setting aside time each day for prayer and reflection. Lately, I\u2019d been quietly repeating a short mantra under my breath between meetings, telling myself it was enough, but guilt gnawed at me. Was I neglecting my spiritual duties for my professional ones? Or was I failing Priya by not being fully present? The expectations pressed in from both sides: to be a devoted mentor, to be a faithful Hindu. My heart raced as I tried to focus on Priya\u2019s words, feeling the weight of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which part of myself I was betraying more."}
