My neighbor, Mrs. Patel, knocked on my door this morning, her eyes anxious. \u201cCould you please watch for my package? I keep missing the delivery.\u201d I nodded, knowing how much she relies on these small kindnesses. Yet, as I settle into my spiritual study, my phone buzzes\u2014a parishioner, desperate, asking if I can meet today. She\u2019s struggling, her faith shaken, and she needs guidance. My heart aches, torn between the quiet duty of neighborly help and the sacred responsibility of spiritual care. If I leave to meet her, I\u2019ll miss the delivery, letting Mrs. Patel down. If I stay, I\u2019ll be unavailable to someone in crisis. The weight of both roles presses on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction. I close my eyes, searching for clarity, but the conflict only grows sharper within me."}
