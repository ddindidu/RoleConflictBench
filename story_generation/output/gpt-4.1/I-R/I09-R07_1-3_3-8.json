Mine was only half-full, but I remembered Mrs. Lee next door had mentioned her bin was overflowing after her grandson\u2019s birthday party. As a neighbor, I felt a tug of responsibility\u2014should I offer her my extra space? It would be considerate, the right thing to do, and I knew she\u2019d appreciate it. But as I reached for my phone to text her, my eyes fell on the stack of Buddhist texts on my table. My teacher had asked me to summarize key teachings for tomorrow\u2019s temple session, and I hadn\u2019t even started. The expectation to engage deeply in spiritual study pressed on me, reminding me of the importance of reflection and preparation. I felt torn, the neighborly urge to help clashing with the spiritual commitment I\u2019d made. My mind raced, weighing the gentle pull of compassion in daily life against the discipline of my Buddhist path. I stood there, caught between the two, heart pounding, unsure which role to honor first."}
