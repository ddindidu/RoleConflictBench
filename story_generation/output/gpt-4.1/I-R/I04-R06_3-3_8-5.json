She was clearly hurt by something I\u2019d said earlier, and I hadn\u2019t even realized how my comment had come across. As her friend, I knew I needed to call her right away, to apologize and talk things through before the misunderstanding grew. But as I reached for my phone, I glanced at the clock\u2014church service was starting in ten minutes. I\u2019d promised my pastor and myself that I\u2019d be there every week, not just for worship but to help with the youth group afterward. The church community counted on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. My hand hovered over my phone, torn between the urgent need to reach out to Sarah and the commitment I\u2019d made to my faith and my church family. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt my chest tighten as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
