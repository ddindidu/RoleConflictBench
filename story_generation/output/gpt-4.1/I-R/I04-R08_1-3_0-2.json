It was Sarah, my closest friend, texting: \u201cUgh, today was endless. Can I vent?\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words. I knew she needed me to listen, to be present, to offer the comfort I always tried to give. But tonight was also the community Quran study circle, and I hadn\u2019t read the assigned verses yet. I felt the weight of my faith\u2019s expectations\u2014reciting and reflecting on the Quran, being prepared to contribute thoughtfully. The study circle was important to me, a chance to deepen my understanding and connect with others in my community. Yet, Sarah was reaching out, trusting me to be there for her. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to my friend, and the responsibility to my faith. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which to answer first."}
