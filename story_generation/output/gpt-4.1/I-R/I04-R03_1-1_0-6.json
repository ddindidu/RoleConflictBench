The convent was quiet, the perfect setting for the afternoon of spiritual reading and reflection I had planned. I felt a deep longing to lose myself in prayer, to reconnect with the peace I so often found in these moments. Just as I closed my eyes, my phone buzzed. It was Anna, my closest friend from before I took my vows. Her message was simple: \u201cHad such a long, boring day. Wish someone would listen.\u201d I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of her words. As a friend, I knew she needed me to listen, to offer comfort and understanding. But as a nun, I felt the pull of my commitment to spiritual discipline, the promise I made to dedicate this time to God. My heart ached, torn between the quiet call of prayer and the urgent need of someone I loved. I sat there, phone in hand, caught between two worlds, unsure which voice to answer first."}
