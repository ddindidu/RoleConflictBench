She\u2019s been looking forward to this, planning a cozy dinner at her place, just the two of us. I know how much it means to her\u2014she\u2019s been dropping hints all week about wanting to make the night special, to feel close before we\u2019re apart. As her boyfriend, I want to give her my full attention, to make her feel loved and cherished.\n\nBut as the night unfolds, the atmosphere shifts. The conversation grows more intimate, and I sense where things are heading. Mia leans in, her eyes searching mine, and I know she wants us to take the next step physically. My heart pounds with affection and longing, but a knot forms in my stomach. My faith is important to me; I\u2019ve always believed in waiting, in honoring the values I grew up with. I can see the hope in her eyes, the trust she\u2019s placing in me, and I feel torn between my love for her and my commitment to my beliefs. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I find myself caught in the tension, unsure of what to do next."}
