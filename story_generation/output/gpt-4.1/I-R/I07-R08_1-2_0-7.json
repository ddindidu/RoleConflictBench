Still, as a colleague, I felt the unspoken expectation to show up, to be present, to contribute. My manager always said, \u201cIt\u2019s important for team spirit.\u201d But my mind kept drifting to something far more significant\u2014my friends were finalizing their plans for Hajj this year. I had saved for years, setting aside money bit by bit, and now the opportunity was here. The pilgrimage is a pillar of my faith, a once-in-a-lifetime journey I had dreamed of. Yet, the timing clashed with work. If I left, I\u2019d miss meetings, maybe let my team down. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss Hajj, maybe let myself down. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between loyalty to my colleagues and devotion to my faith. My heart pounded as I stared at the meeting invite, unsure which path to choose."}
