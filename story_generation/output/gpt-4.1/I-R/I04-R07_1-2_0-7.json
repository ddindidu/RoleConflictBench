It\u2019s Mia, my closest friend. \u201cHad the worst day. Can you talk?\u201d she writes. I pause, thumb hovering over the reply button. As a friend, I know what\u2019s expected of me: to listen, to be present, to offer comfort when she needs it most. She\u2019s always there for me, and I want to be there for her.\n\nBut tonight is the study circle, and we\u2019re discussing a chapter I haven\u2019t read yet. As a Buddhist, I\u2019ve committed to this practice, to learning and reflecting with my sangha. I feel the weight of that promise, the quiet pull toward spiritual growth and discipline.\n\nMy heart tugs in two directions. I want to be the friend Mia needs, but I also want to honor my commitment to the path I\u2019ve chosen. The minutes tick by as I stare at my phone, torn between the warmth of friendship and the call of spiritual study, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me."}
