My mentee\u2019s project review was running late, and I\u2019d promised to give her feedback before the weekend. She looked at me, hopeful, notebook open, waiting for my guidance. As her mentor, I felt responsible for her progress, knowing how much she relied on my support. But the call to prayer echoed through the hallway, reminding me that Friday worship was about to begin. I reached for my scarf, only to realize I\u2019d left my abaya at home in my rush this morning. Entering the main prayer hall without proper modest dress was unthinkable for me as a Muslim. My mentee\u2019s eyes pleaded for just a few more minutes, but the imam\u2019s voice grew louder, signaling the congregation was gathering. I felt torn\u2014my duty to guide her clashed with my commitment to my faith and its expectations. My mind raced, weighing the disappointment in her eyes against the discomfort and guilt I\u2019d feel if I entered the prayer hall unprepared. The hallway seemed to close in, the pressure of both roles pressing on my chest as I stood frozen, caught between two worlds."}
