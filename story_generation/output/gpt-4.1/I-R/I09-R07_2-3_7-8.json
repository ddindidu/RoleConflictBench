My teacher\u2019s message echoes in my mind: \u201cPlease share your understanding with the sangha tomorrow.\u201d I want to do justice to the teachings, to reflect deeply and prepare a clear summary. But the storm advisory on my phone flashes again, and I remember Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, who lives alone just down the hall. I know she relies on neighbors for small things\u2014receiving her mail, checking in when the weather turns bad. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: the expectation to be a good neighbor, to knock on her door and make sure she\u2019s safe, and the pull to honor my commitment to the sangha by preparing well. My mind tugs in two directions, compassion for Mrs. Lee and devotion to my practice, each demanding my time and presence tonight. I sit, heart unsettled, caught between the call of the world outside my door and the quiet teachings before me."}
