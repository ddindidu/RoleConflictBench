It was Priya, my closest friend, her voice trembling. She was on her way to the airport and thought she\u2019d left her passport at home. \u201cCan you check and bring it to me? I\u2019ll miss my flight otherwise,\u201d she pleaded. My heart raced. As a friend, I knew she was counting on me, expecting me to drop everything and help her in this emergency. But as a Hindu, I felt the weight of my daily ritual, the quiet time I set aside to chant my mantras and find peace. I\u2019d already skipped the full ritual today, whispering a few lines between tasks, and guilt gnawed at me. If I left now, I\u2019d miss my only chance to complete my prayers properly. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the urgent call of friendship and the quiet pull of my faith, unsure which path to take."}
