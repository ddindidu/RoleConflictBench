She was bright, ambitious, and had worked hard for this chance. As her mentor, I was expected to encourage her growth, to help her navigate the complexities of the workplace and seize this opportunity. But earlier that day, I had overheard her discussing with a colleague how she intended to secure the promotion\u2014by quietly ignoring a serious case of corruption she had discovered in her department. \n\nAs a Hindu, my conscience screamed at me to act, to uphold dharma and speak out against wrongdoing, no matter the cost. Yet, as a mentor, I was torn. Should I support Priya\u2019s pragmatic approach, knowing it might help her career but compromise her integrity? Or should I guide her to do what is right, even if it risks everything she\u2019s worked for? The weight of these conflicting expectations pressed down on me, my mind swirling with doubt and responsibility, as I struggled to find the right path forward."}
