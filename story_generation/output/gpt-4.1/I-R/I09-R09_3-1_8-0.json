With the power outage, I\u2019m worried about things getting lost.\u201d I nodded, of course\u2014I\u2019ve always believed in being a good neighbor, especially since we look out for each other in this building. But as I closed my door, I glanced at the calendar. The outage was scheduled right during my weekly study time with my kids, when I teach them about our Jewish traditions and stories. It\u2019s a time I cherish, a promise I made to myself and to them, to pass on our heritage. I could move the lesson, but I know how much the routine means to my children, how it anchors them. Yet, I also know how much my neighbor is counting on me, and how important it is to be there for each other. The two roles tug at me, each with its own weight, and I feel the tension building as I try to figure out how to honor both commitments without letting anyone down."}
