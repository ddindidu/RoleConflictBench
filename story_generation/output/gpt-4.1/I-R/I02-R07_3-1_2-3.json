My hand rests on her back, but I feel helpless, unsure if my presence is enough. She needs me\u2014my words, my comfort, my undivided attention. I want to be the boyfriend she can lean on, the one who holds her together when she feels like falling apart. But as I glance at the clock, I remember the ten-minute window I set aside for my evening meditation. It\u2019s the only time today I can practice, the only chance to find a moment of stillness and clarity. My mind tugs in two directions: one voice urges me to stay, to hold her, to be her anchor; the other whispers about the importance of mindfulness, of not abandoning my own needs and spiritual practice. My heart aches with the weight of both roles, each demanding something I can\u2019t give fully at the same time. I close my eyes for a moment, feeling the tension coil inside me, uncertain which path to take."}
