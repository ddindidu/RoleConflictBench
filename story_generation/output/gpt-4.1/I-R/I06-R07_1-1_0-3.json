The reading wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew she\u2019d be pleased if I finished early. I wanted to impress her, to show I was dedicated and eager. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I realized my ten-minute window for meditation was approaching. My Buddhist practice was important to me; it was my anchor, my way to stay grounded and present. But the thought of my mentor\u2019s approving smile tugged at me. Should I dive into the reading now, using this quiet time to get ahead, or should I honor my commitment to mindfulness? My mind buzzed with guilt and anxiety, torn between the desire to excel as a mentee and the need to nurture my spiritual well-being. The minutes ticked by, and I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, each demanding my attention, each promising a different kind of fulfillment."}
