The deadline was in three days, and I knew he expected nothing less than my best effort. As his mentee, I wanted to prove I was reliable, someone who could be trusted with responsibility. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from a member of my congregation. She was in crisis, her voice trembling over the phone earlier, desperate for guidance as she faced a decision that could change her life. As her pastor, I was her anchor, the one she turned to for spiritual counsel and comfort. I felt the weight of her trust, the urgency in her words. My mind raced, torn between the code that demanded my focus and the soul that needed my presence. Each role pulled at me with its own gravity, and I could feel the tension building inside, a knot of anxiety and guilt. I wanted to be everything to everyone, but tonight, I wasn\u2019t sure how."}
