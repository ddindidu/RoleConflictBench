She smiled, but her eyes were tight with worry. \u201cFather, do you have a moment?\u201d she asked. I knew what it was about\u2014the noise complaint that had everyone on edge this week. As her neighbor, I was expected to listen patiently, reassure her, and keep things friendly. But as a priest, I was already running late for the class I was supposed to lead, and the parents would be waiting with their children, expecting me to be there on time and prepared. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in on me: the neighbor who should offer a listening ear, and the priest who must guide and teach. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first, feeling the tension rise with every second that passed."}
