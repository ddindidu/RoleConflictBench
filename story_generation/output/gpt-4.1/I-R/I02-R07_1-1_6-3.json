It\u2019s a small misunderstanding, but I know how these things can spiral. As her boyfriend, I feel the urge to call her right away, to smooth things over, to reassure her that I care and that we can work it out. That\u2019s what a good partner does\u2014resolves conflicts before they grow.\n\nBut I also see the clock. In two minutes, I\u2019m supposed to begin my daily meditation, a quiet ten-minute window I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t skip. As a Buddhist, I value this time to practice mindfulness, to let go of attachments and cultivate inner peace. The expectation is to be present, to not let external events pull me away from my practice.\n\nMy phone buzzes again. I feel the tension rising, torn between the urge to respond and the commitment to my meditation. My mind races, wrestling with the demands of being a supportive boyfriend and a devoted Buddhist. I close my eyes, but the conflict churns inside me, unresolved."}
