Tonight, I had planned to immerse myself in the Quran, to recite and reflect in the quiet that I so often craved. It was a promise I\u2019d made to myself after a week of busyness\u2014a chance to reconnect with my faith and find peace in its verses.\n\nJust as I settled onto the prayer mat, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Samir, my mentee. \u201cSorry for the late text, but I\u2019m stuck on the project. Can you help?\u201d I knew how much this project meant to him, and as his mentor, I\u2019d always prided myself on being available, offering guidance whenever he needed it. But tonight, the pull of my own spiritual needs was strong. I stared at the phone, torn between the expectation to support Samir and my longing to fulfill my commitment to my faith. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands of both roles, feeling the tension rise within me, unsure which path to choose."}
