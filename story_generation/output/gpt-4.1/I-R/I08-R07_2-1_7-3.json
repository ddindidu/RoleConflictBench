The clock ticked closer to my quiet window, and I felt anticipation for the peace I always found in those moments. Just then, an acquaintance slid into the seat beside me, glancing around before leaning in. \u201cDid you see Mark\u2019s report? Honestly, I don\u2019t know how he still has this job,\u201d she whispered, her tone sharp.\n\nAs an acquaintance, I knew the unspoken rule: nod along, maybe add a comment, and certainly don\u2019t make things awkward. But as a Buddhist, I felt the tug of my practice\u2014mindfulness, compassion, and the commitment to avoid negative speech. My mind raced. If I joined in, I\u2019d betray my values. If I refused, I risked alienating her, maybe even seeming self-righteous. The minutes ticked by, my meditation window slipping away, my heart pounding with the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
