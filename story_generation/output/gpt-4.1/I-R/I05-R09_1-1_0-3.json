She looked anxious, holding out a chocolate croissant. \u201cI wanted to thank you for your advice last week,\u201d she said, her eyes hopeful. I knew she\u2019d been struggling with her project, and I\u2019d only offered a few words of encouragement, but it clearly meant a lot to her. As her mentor, I wanted to accept her gesture, to show her that her gratitude was appreciated and that I was approachable. But I also knew the croissant wasn\u2019t kosher, and I\u2019d always been careful to keep my dietary observance visible, especially in the workplace. The pantry was full of kosher snacks I could have offered in return, but refusing her gift might seem cold or ungrateful. I could feel the tension rising in my chest\u2014torn between being the supportive mentor she needed and staying true to my Jewish values. I smiled, but inside, I was wrestling with what to do next."}
