My daughter had called, reminding me how much it meant to everyone that I join the family dinner, to share stories and laughter, to be present. I knew how important these gatherings were, especially now that the grandchildren were growing so quickly. I promised I\u2019d be there, and I meant it.\n\nBut as I walked through the quiet hallway at work, lost in thought about the upcoming holiday, I spotted an acquaintance approaching. We weren\u2019t close, but we always exchanged a few words in passing. Today, though, my mind was elsewhere\u2014worrying about the family, the preparations, the sense of obligation. Still, I knew the unspoken rule: a friendly nod, a smile, maybe a brief chat. It was expected, a small gesture to maintain harmony.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting\u2014my family needed my attention, but so did the world outside. I hesitated, caught between the warmth of home and the civility of daily life, unsure which role to honor in that fleeting moment."}
