My husband has already mentioned, more than once, that he\u2019s run out of clean socks. I promised I\u2019d fold the laundry tonight, and I know he\u2019s counting on me to help keep the house running smoothly. But as I reach for the first shirt, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from a friend, inviting me to a small get-together. She mentions a new person will be there, someone shy who doesn\u2019t know anyone else. She asks if I can come, just to help break the ice and make the newcomer feel welcome.\n\nI feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. At home, I\u2019m needed as a partner, someone who shares the load and keeps our life together moving. But as an acquaintance, I\u2019m expected to be warm and open, to help others feel comfortable and included. I stare at the laundry, then at my phone, my mind racing with guilt and worry, torn between the comfort of home and the needs of someone I barely know."}
