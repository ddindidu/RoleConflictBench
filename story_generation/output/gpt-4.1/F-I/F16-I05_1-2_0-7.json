My mentee, Sarah, was counting on me tonight\u2014her big interview was tomorrow, and she\u2019d asked for a last-minute prep session. I knew how much this meant for her career, and I wanted to be the mentor she needed: focused, encouraging, insightful. Just as I was reviewing her resume, my partner walked in, dropped their bag, and sighed. \u201cWork was a mess today,\u201d they said, voice light but eyes tired. I could tell they needed me to listen, to be present, to offer the comfort only I could give. But the clock was ticking, and Sarah was waiting. My partner\u2019s hand brushed my shoulder, lingering, and I felt the weight of their unspoken need. I wanted to be there for both of them, but the expectations pulled me in opposite directions.
