My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you help with the folding tonight? I\u2019ve had a long day.\u201d I promised I would, and I meant it. But my phone buzzes again\u2014another message from Maya, my mentee at work. She\u2019s stuck on the final steps of a project that could make or break her career, and she\u2019s asking for my guidance. I know how much this means to her; one misstep and the whole thing could unravel. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. At home, I\u2019m expected to be a partner, to share the load, to show I care. At work, I\u2019m the mentor, the steady hand, the one who\u2019s supposed to have answers. I pace between the laundry and my phone, heart pounding, torn between the comfort of home and the responsibility of shaping someone\u2019s future."}
