My daughter had called twice to remind me, and my grandson was excited to show me his new toy train. I could already picture the laughter, the stories, the warmth of being surrounded by family. As I was about to leave, the doorbell rang. It was the new neighbor, holding a small cake, her face hopeful and a little nervous. \u201cI just moved in next door,\u201d she said, \u201cand I wanted to introduce myself.\u201d I knew how important it was to be welcoming, to make her feel at home in a new place. She looked at me, waiting for an invitation to chat, maybe even share a cup of tea. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the family who expected my presence, and toward the neighbor who needed a friendly face. I stood there, cake in hand, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which door to walk through first."}
