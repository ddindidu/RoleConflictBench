My son sits at the table, quietly working on his homework, while I mentally tally the bills stacked beside me. Rent is due in three days, and the grocery list is growing longer. I know I need to pick up extra shifts or at least make sure I\u2019m on top of every project at work\u2014my family depends on my paycheck.\n\nBut my phone keeps buzzing. It\u2019s my team\u2019s group chat. They\u2019re waiting for my input on a project detail before they can move forward. I see the words \u201curgent\u201d and \u201cneed your clarification\u201d flash across the screen. I know the expectation: I\u2019m supposed to be responsive, a reliable colleague who doesn\u2019t hold up the workflow. If I don\u2019t reply soon, the project could stall, and I can\u2019t afford to look unreliable\u2014not when I need this job so much.\n\nMy heart pounds as I stare at the phone, torn between the pressure to secure my family\u2019s financial stability and the immediate demand from my colleagues. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting me to be present, decisive, and dependable."}
