My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind from this morning: \u201cCan you please fold the laundry today? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d I promised I would, but now, at 8 p.m., my laptop glows with an urgent email from my teammate, reminding me that my part of the project is due tonight. If I don\u2019t finish, the whole team will be delayed, and I know how much they\u2019re counting on me. My spouse expects me to share the load at home, to show I care and that we\u2019re in this together. My colleagues expect me to be reliable, to keep the workflow moving. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, my mind racing with guilt and frustration. I want to be dependable in both worlds, but right now, I can\u2019t see how to be both the partner and the professional everyone needs me to be."}
