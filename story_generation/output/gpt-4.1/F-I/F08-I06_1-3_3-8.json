The family gathering was circled in bright red\u2014my daughter had reminded me twice how much it meant to the grandchildren that I\u2019d be there. I could already picture their eager faces, the smell of my famous apple pie, the warmth of everyone together. But then my phone buzzed: a message from my mentor. She\u2019d managed to squeeze in a session for me, just before her flight, apologizing for the short notice but emphasizing how important it was to connect before her trip. I knew how rare her time was, how much I\u2019d been looking forward to her guidance. My mind raced. If I left for the session, I\u2019d miss the first hour of the gathering, maybe more. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my mentor, who had gone out of her way for me. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest\u2014my family\u2019s expectations, my mentor\u2019s trust. I sat at the kitchen table, torn, the clock ticking louder with every passing second."}
