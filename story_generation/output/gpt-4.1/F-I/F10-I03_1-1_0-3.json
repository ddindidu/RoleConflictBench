Call us when you can.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014Sunday evening already. I haven\u2019t called home all week, just sent a quick text yesterday. Guilt prickles at me; I know how much my parents value hearing my voice, not just reading a line or two. But as I start to dial, another message pops up\u2014this time from Alex: \u201cHey, want to do dinner tomorrow or Tuesday? Miss you.\u201d We\u2019ve both been busy, and finally, our schedules line up. I want to be present with him, to show him he\u2019s a priority, not just someone I squeeze in. But if I spend tomorrow with Alex, I\u2019ll probably be too tired to call home, and if I call my parents tonight, I\u2019ll be distracted, thinking about plans with Alex. I feel torn, pulled between being a good daughter and a loving girlfriend, wishing I could be both at once without letting anyone down. My thumb hovers over the call button, heart heavy with the weight of choosing."}
