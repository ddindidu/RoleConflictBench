She looked up and smiled, but I could see the tiredness in her eyes. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d she said, her voice light but edged with fatigue. I knew she wanted me to sit beside her, listen, maybe offer a hug or a few words to help her unwind. I wanted to be there for her, to show her she wasn\u2019t alone in her stress.\n\nBut as I set my bag down, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the report for the team was still unfinished. It wasn\u2019t urgent\u2014there was plenty of time before the deadline, and no one was waiting on it tonight. Still, I felt the weight of responsibility, the silent expectation to keep up, to not let my colleagues down. I stood in the hallway, torn between the comfort of the living room and the pull of my home office, my heart tugged in two directions. I wanted to be the supportive husband she needed, but the diligent colleague in me whispered that I should get ahead while I could."}
