I know how much it means to them, especially after missing last week\u2019s art show. My heart aches at the thought of their disappointed faces if I\u2019m late again. But just as I grab my keys, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from my girlfriend: \u201cCan we talk? I can\u2019t keep arguing like this.\u201d We\u2019ve been at each other\u2019s throats all week about money, and I know she\u2019s expecting me to finally sit down and work things out. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my stepchildren needing me to show up, my girlfriend needing me to listen and fix what\u2019s broken between us. My chest tightens as I stand in the hallway, torn between the front door and the living room, between being the reliable step-parent and the supportive partner. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and I don\u2019t know which need is greater."}
