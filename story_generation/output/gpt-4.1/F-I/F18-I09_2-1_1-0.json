He looked like he\u2019d been crying, his shoulders hunched, eyes red. I knew something had happened at school\u2014he always tried to hide it, but I could tell. I wanted to pull him aside, ask what was wrong, and just be there for him like I always promised I would. But just as I turned to him, Mrs. Lee from next door stepped out with her grocery bags. She smiled, expecting the usual cheerful greeting. I could feel her eyes on us, waiting for that neighborly hello, the polite small talk that kept things pleasant in our building. My brother\u2019s pain tugged at me, but so did the pressure to keep up appearances, to not let anyone see our family\u2019s struggles. I stood there, caught between my brother\u2019s silent plea for comfort and Mrs. Lee\u2019s friendly expectation, my heart pounding as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
