My grandchildren had been talking about it for weeks, and I could already picture their eager faces, waiting for me to arrive with my famous cookies. Just as I was about to start getting ready, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mrs. Lee next door. She was expecting an important package this afternoon and asked if I could keep an eye out for it, since she\u2019d be at work and the delivery driver always seemed to miss her.\n\nI felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As a grandparent, I wanted nothing more than to be present for my family, to laugh and share stories with my grandchildren. But as a neighbor, I knew how much Mrs. Lee relied on me for these small favors, especially since she lived alone. I could sense the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, each pulling me in a different direction. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the warmth of family and the quiet responsibility of being a good neighbor, unsure which path to take."}
