My daughter had just called, her voice bubbling with excitement\u2014my grandson had won his first art competition, and the family was gathering tonight to celebrate. She wanted me there, to see his proud smile and hear him talk about his painting. I could almost picture his eager face, waiting for my praise. But as I glanced at my inbox, I saw a reminder for the project update my team was expecting. The deadline wasn\u2019t tight, but I\u2019d promised to have my part ready today. My colleagues were counting on me to keep things moving smoothly, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s joy and my team\u2019s trust. My heart tugged me toward the celebration, but my sense of responsibility anchored me to my work. I sat there, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
