My spouse\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but firm: \u201cLet\u2019s try to keep up with chores together.\u201d I know they\u2019ve had a long week, and I want to do my part, to show I care in the small, everyday ways that matter.\n\nBut my phone buzzes\u2014a message from my boyfriend. He\u2019s had a rough day at work, nothing dramatic, just the slow grind wearing him down. He doesn\u2019t ask for much, but I can sense he needs me to listen, to be present, to offer comfort and understanding. I want to be there for him, to be the supportive girlfriend he can lean on.\n\nI feel pulled in two directions, the weight of expectation pressing on my chest. If I fold the laundry now, I\u2019ll be late to call him, and he might feel neglected. If I call him first, the chores will wait, and my spouse might feel let down. My heart aches with the impossibility of being enough for both, and I sit, paralyzed, between the two worlds I\u2019ve built."}
