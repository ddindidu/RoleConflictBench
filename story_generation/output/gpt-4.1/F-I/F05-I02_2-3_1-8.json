My wife, exhausted and anxious, tells me she\u2019s facing a huge decision at work\u2014her boss wants her to take on a risky project, and she needs my advice. She\u2019s always counted on me to be her sounding board, her steady support. I know she\u2019s waiting for me to listen, reassure her, and help her see things clearly.\n\nBut just as I\u2019m about to call her, my girlfriend texts, her words sharp and desperate. Our argument from earlier has spiraled, and now she\u2019s questioning if we should even stay together. She expects me to step in, calm things down, and fix what\u2019s broken between us. I can feel her anger and hurt through the screen, and I know if I don\u2019t respond, things might end for good.\n\nI sit on the edge of my bed, phone in hand, heart pounding. Both women need me, but in completely different ways. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the weight of their expectations presses down on me, leaving me paralyzed, torn between the roles I\u2019ve chosen and the people I care about."}
