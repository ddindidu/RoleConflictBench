I really need your advice.\u201d My heart swelled with the familiar warmth of being needed, of being the steady hand she could reach for. I knew she was struggling with something serious\u2014she\u2019d hinted at trouble with a friend at school, and I wanted to offer her the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years, to guide her gently through the confusion.\n\nBut just as I was about to call her, my neighbor, who I only knew in passing, waved me over to join a group gathered outside. They were deep in conversation about a mutual acquaintance, dissecting her recent choices. I felt the unspoken pressure to join in, to share what I knew, to be part of the group. Yet, I remembered the importance of not speaking ill of others, especially when I barely knew the woman they were discussing.\n\nTorn between the urge to be the wise, supportive grandmother and the expectation to remain neutral and kind as an acquaintance, I felt the tension knotting in my chest. Both roles demanded something different from me, and I sat there, phone in hand, uncertain which path to take."}
