My wife is in the next room, her world unraveling after devastating news about her family. She needs me\u2014my arms, my words, my unwavering presence. I hear her muffled sobs and feel the weight of her expectation: to be her anchor, to hold her together when she\u2019s falling apart.\n\nBut my phone buzzes again. It\u2019s my girlfriend, texting about her rough day at work. She\u2019s not in crisis, but she\u2019s hoping for comfort, a listening ear, a gentle reminder that she matters. She expects me to be attentive, to care, to make her feel special even in the small storms.\n\nI stare at the wall, torn. My wife\u2019s pain is raw and immediate, demanding all of me. My girlfriend\u2019s needs are quieter but no less real. I want to be everything for both, but the demands pull me in opposite directions. My chest tightens as I weigh their needs against my own limits, knowing that whatever I choose, someone will feel my absence."}
