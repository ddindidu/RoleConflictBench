My stepdad wanted us all to go hiking, and my stepsister was excitedly suggesting a picnic. I knew they expected me to join in, to be part of the family, to show that I cared about these moments together. Just as I was about to chime in, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Jamie, an acquaintance from my college class. Her car had broken down on a quiet road outside town, and she was asking if I could come help her out. I could almost hear the anxiety in her text, and I knew she didn\u2019t have anyone else nearby to call. I looked up at my stepfamily, their faces bright with anticipation, waiting for my input. My phone vibrated again in my hand. I felt torn\u2014should I be the reliable step-sibling they wanted, or the supportive acquaintance Jamie needed? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I was supposed to choose."}
