She mentioned her day had been a bit rough\u2014her boss had been nitpicky, and a project deadline got moved up. I could see she needed me to listen, to be present, to offer the comfort she always expects from me. As I sat down beside her, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my friend, Mark. He\u2019d misread my earlier text and thought I was annoyed with him. His reply was curt, and I could tell he was hurt. I knew from past experience that if I didn\u2019t call him right away to clear things up, the misunderstanding would fester. But my wife was looking at me, waiting for me to ask about her day, to be the supportive husband she counted on. My phone vibrated again. I felt torn\u2014my friend needed reassurance and honesty, but my wife needed my attention and empathy. My heart pounded as I tried to decide who needed me more in this moment, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
