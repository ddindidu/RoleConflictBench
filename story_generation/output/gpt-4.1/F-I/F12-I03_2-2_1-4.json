As a wife, I know my husband needs me\u2014he\u2019s been anxious all week about a major decision at work. He called earlier, voice trembling, asking if we could talk tonight. He needs my support, my advice, my presence. But as a girlfriend, I promised my partner we\u2019d spend this one free evening together before she leaves for a week-long trip. She\u2019s been looking forward to it, planning every detail, hoping we\u2019d make memories to hold onto while she\u2019s away. I can hear her laughter from the living room, waiting for me to join her. My husband\u2019s text notification lights up my screen, a silent plea for comfort. My girlfriend\u2019s playlist drifts through the apartment, a reminder of the night we planned. I feel torn, pulled in two directions by love and loyalty, expectations and needs. My chest tightens as I try to decide where I belong tonight, knowing I can\u2019t be both places at once."}
