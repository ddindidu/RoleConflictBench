He asked about my day, and I started to tell him about a tense moment at work, but my phone buzzed insistently. It was Mia, my closest friend, and her message popped up: \u201cHey, are we meeting at the caf\u00e9 or your place? I\u2019m confused.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been upset with me lately, and we\u2019d agreed to talk things out tonight. She needed clarity, and I\u2019d promised to be open and responsive.\n\nBut my husband was looking at me, waiting for me to finish my story, expecting the same openness we\u2019d promised each other in our marriage. I could see he wanted my full attention, to feel like he mattered more than the distractions of the outside world. My phone buzzed again. I felt torn\u2014if I ignored Mia, she might think I was avoiding her, making things worse. But if I picked up my phone now, my husband would feel sidelined, like he was second to my friends. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, caught between two people who both needed me to be present, honest, and open\u2014right now."}
