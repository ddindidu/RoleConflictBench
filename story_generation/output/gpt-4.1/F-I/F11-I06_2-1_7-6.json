My younger brother had just messaged, frustrated after a rough day at school. He wanted to talk, and I knew he needed me to listen without judgment, to be patient and understanding\u2014just like we\u2019d promised each other after our last argument. At the same time, my mentor\u2019s office hours were about to start. She\u2019d emphasized how important it was to respect her time, to show up prepared and on schedule. I\u2019d been looking forward to asking her about my project, and I didn\u2019t want to waste her availability or seem uncommitted.\n\nMy brother\u2019s words replayed in my mind, his trust in me fragile but growing. But my mentor\u2019s calendar reminder blinked insistently, a silent expectation that I\u2019d honor her time. I felt the pressure mounting, my heart racing as I weighed the demands. I wanted to be the sister who listened, who built respect through patience. I also wanted to be the mentee who valued her mentor\u2019s guidance. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
