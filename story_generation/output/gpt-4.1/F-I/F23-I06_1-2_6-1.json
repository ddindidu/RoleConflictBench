My phone buzzed with a message from my partner: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Jamie\u2019s expecting the Nintendo this weekend. He\u2019s been talking about it nonstop.\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. The money I\u2019d set aside for the console was now the only buffer in our account, and I knew how much Jamie was counting on me to keep my promise. But the code assignment was crucial\u2014my mentor had stressed how important it was for my growth, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the need to be a reliable step-parent, to bring joy and stability to Jamie, and the drive to prove myself as a dedicated mentee, worthy of my mentor\u2019s trust. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my new family and the demands of my own ambitions, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
