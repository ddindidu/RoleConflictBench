My husband had already mentioned this morning that the kids needed their uniforms for tomorrow\u2019s game, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d take care of it. But as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed with a message from my mentor: \u201cAny updates on your project? Let me know if you\u2019re facing any issues.\u201d My heart pounded. The truth was, my teammates and I had hit a wall\u2014misunderstandings and disagreements had stalled our progress, and the deadline was looming. I knew I should reach out, explain the situation, and ask for guidance, just as my mentor expected. But the laundry couldn\u2019t wait either. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me. If I focused on the laundry, I\u2019d be letting my mentor down by staying silent. If I drafted that difficult message, the laundry would sit untouched, and I\u2019d break my promise at home. I stood frozen, torn between the demands of being a good wife and a responsible mentee, unsure which role to answer first."}
