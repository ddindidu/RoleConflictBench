His eyes looked tired, and he started talking about how overwhelmed he felt at work and how hard it was to connect with my mom lately. He needed someone to listen, to reassure him, and I could feel the weight of his words pressing on me. I wanted to be there for him, to show him he wasn\u2019t alone, but just as he started to open up, my dog started barking loudly in the hallway. I knew Mrs. Lee next door hated the noise\u2014she\u2019d already left a note about it last week. I could hear her door creak open, probably to see what was going on. I felt torn, my stepdad\u2019s voice growing more vulnerable while my dog\u2019s barking echoed through the hall. Should I comfort my stepdad, or rush to quiet my dog before the neighbors got upset again? My heart pounded as I sat between the two worlds, feeling like I was letting someone down no matter what I did."}
