The school had just called\u2014my son was caught bullying a classmate. My mind raced with worry and guilt, picturing his face, wondering what had gone wrong. I knew I had to go to the school, talk to the teacher, and most importantly, talk to my son. He needed me to be there, to guide him, to show him right from wrong.\n\nBut just as I was about to leave, my boyfriend texted. He was upset about our weekend plans, thinking I\u2019d forgotten or didn\u2019t care. I could sense the tension in his words, the disappointment. He wanted to talk, to clear things up before it grew into something bigger. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my child needed me as a mother, but my boyfriend needed me as a partner. Both expected me to be present, to listen, to fix things. My chest tightened as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the two people who mattered most to me, unsure which door to walk through first."}
