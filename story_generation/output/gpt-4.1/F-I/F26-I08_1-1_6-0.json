As a grandparent, I know how much my children and grandchildren expect me to be present, to call and check in, to help keep our family traditions alive. The holiday is just days away, and I haven\u2019t yet reached out to everyone. I feel the weight of their expectations, the unspoken hope that I\u2019ll be the glue holding us together.\n\nJust then, I spotted Mrs. Lee, an acquaintance from down the hall, coming toward me. She\u2019s always friendly, always ready for a chat, and I know she expects the same from me. I could see the anticipation in her eyes, the slight smile forming as she prepared to greet me. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my daughter, probably about the holiday plans. I felt torn, caught between the urge to stop and be the approachable neighbor Mrs. Lee expects, and the pressing need to respond to my family, to fulfill my role as the ever-present grandparent. My heart raced as I slowed my steps, uncertain which expectation to meet first."}
