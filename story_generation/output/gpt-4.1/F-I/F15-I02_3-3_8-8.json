The home loan repayment loomed over me, just two months away, and I knew I had to start setting aside every spare dollar. My mind raced with calculations\u2014groceries, school fees, the electricity bill. I couldn\u2019t let my family down; they depended on me to keep us afloat.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a message from Mia. \u201cWe need to talk. I can\u2019t keep doing this if you won\u2019t listen.\u201d My heart clenched. Our argument last night still echoed in my head\u2014her voice trembling, mine raised in frustration. She needed me to be present, to work through our problems, to show her that our relationship mattered. But every time I tried to focus on us, the weight of my family\u2019s needs pulled me away.\n\nI stared at the screen, torn.
