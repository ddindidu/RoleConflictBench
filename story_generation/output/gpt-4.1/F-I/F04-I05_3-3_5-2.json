Mom\u2019s text was clear: \u201cWe really want you there this year. It\u2019s been too long since we were all together.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and hopeful. My little sister sent a string of excited emojis, already planning the games we\u2019d play. I knew how much it meant to them, especially after the tough year we\u2019d had apart.\n\nBut my laptop chimed with a calendar reminder\u2014my mentee, Jordan, was waiting for our call. He was on the verge of a huge career decision, and he\u2019d asked for my help to weigh his options. He trusted me to guide him, to be present and thoughtful, not distracted or rushed. I\u2019d promised him my full attention, knowing how much this moment mattered for his future.\n\nMy heart twisted as I looked between the two screens. My family needed me, and so did Jordan. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of their expectations pressing down on me, unsure how I could possibly be the brother and the mentor they both deserved."}
