He asked about my day, his tone light, expecting the kind of open, honest conversation we promised each other when we married. I wanted to tell him everything, to share the weight pressing on my chest, but my mind kept drifting to the argument I\u2019d had earlier with my boyfriend. That fight had left me raw, questioning if we could even make it through. He wanted resolution, needed me to fight for us, to talk through every jagged edge of our conflict until we found peace. But here, at home, I was expected to be present, to communicate openly, not to bring in the chaos from outside. My husband\u2019s gentle eyes searched mine for connection, while my phone buzzed with desperate messages from my boyfriend, pleading for answers. I felt split in two, torn between the comfort of honesty and the urgency of reconciliation, unable to give either what they needed from me."}
