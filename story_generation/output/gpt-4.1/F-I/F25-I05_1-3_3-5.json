As her step-child, I feel the weight of her expectations\u2014smiling, participating, and making her feel like I belong. This year, though, the baking day falls on the same afternoon I promised to mentor a new intern at work. She\u2019s handling her first big project, and I know how easily things can go wrong if she doesn\u2019t get the right guidance.
