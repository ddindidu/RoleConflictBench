My heart pounded as I tried to remember every lesson I\u2019d ever tried to teach him about honesty and respect. I knew I had to address it, to show him that stealing was wrong, even if it meant embarrassment or tears. As we walked home, my mind raced with what to say, how to make this a teaching moment without crushing his spirit.\n\nJust as we reached our apartment building, Mrs. Lee from next door stepped into the corridor. She smiled warmly, her arms full of groceries. \u201cHello! How are you two today?\u201d she asked, her voice cheerful. I forced a smile, feeling the weight of my son\u2019s small, guilty hand in mine. I knew she expected a friendly, light exchange, but inside, I was torn. I wanted to be the pleasant neighbor she knew, but I was also a parent in crisis, struggling to balance discipline with kindness, honesty with composure. The words caught in my throat as I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which role to let show."}
