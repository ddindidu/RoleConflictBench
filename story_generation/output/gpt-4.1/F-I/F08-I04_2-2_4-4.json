Everyone\u2019s eyes sparkled with anticipation, and I could feel the warmth of being needed and included. Just as she began to speak, my phone buzzed. It was my dear friend, panicked and breathless, calling from a taxi on the way to the airport. She thought she\u2019d left her passport at home and begged me to check and, if it was there, rush it to her before her international flight. My heart pounded. My family expected me to be present, to celebrate this special moment together. But my friend was counting on me in a crisis, trusting I\u2019d drop everything to help. I looked at my daughter\u2019s hopeful face, then at my phone, torn between the joy of family and the loyalty of friendship, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
