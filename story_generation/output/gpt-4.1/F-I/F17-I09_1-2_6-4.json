I could sense something was off, so I asked, \u201cIs everything okay at home?\u201d She smiled, but her eyes looked tired. I wanted to be there for her, to listen and offer comfort, just like I always tried to do. But then, a sharp bark echoed from the hallway\u2014my dog, again, reacting to footsteps near our shared door. I winced, knowing our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had already mentioned the noise last week. I felt torn. My parents needed me to be present and supportive, but I also had to keep the peace with our neighbors, making sure my dog didn\u2019t disturb them. The pressure built inside me, the urge to comfort my mom clashing with the responsibility to be a considerate neighbor. I could hear my dog\u2019s barking grow louder, and I felt my heart race, caught between two worlds that both needed me in different ways."}
