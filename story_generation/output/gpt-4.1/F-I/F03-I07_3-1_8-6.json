My phone buzzed with another message from a colleague, just a quick update about a project, nothing urgent, but I knew the expectation\u2014respond promptly, keep the flow going. At that moment, my mom sat down across from me, her eyes red and tired. She started talking, her voice trembling as she shared how overwhelmed she felt lately, how she needed someone to listen. I could feel the weight of her words, the unspoken plea for comfort. My mind raced\u2014my parents had always leaned on me for support, especially in moments like this. But as she spoke, my laptop pinged again, another message from work. I felt torn, my attention split between the screen and my mom\u2019s pain. I wanted to be fully present for her, to offer the support she needed, but the pressure to stay responsive at work tugged at me. My heart pounded as I sat there, caught between the expectations of being a good son and a reliable colleague, unsure which role to answer first."}
