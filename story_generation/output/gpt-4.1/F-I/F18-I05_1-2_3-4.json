The project deadline was looming, and I knew they were counting on me to help them grasp the final concepts. Just as I was mapping out the last activity, my younger brother plopped down beside me, eyes bright. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about what to do this weekend\u2014come help us decide!\u201d My mom called from the living room, \u201cWe want everyone\u2019s input!\u201d I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure of time. My family expected me to be present, to laugh and plan with them, but my mentees needed me to be prepared, to guide them through the skills they were struggling with. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of family togetherness and the responsibility I felt toward my mentees. I could hear their voices in my head, both groups waiting, both expecting me to show up fully. My hands hovered over my keyboard, heart pounding, as I tried to figure out how to be both the sibling my family wanted and the mentor my students needed."}
