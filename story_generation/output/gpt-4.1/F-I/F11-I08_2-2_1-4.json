It was my younger sister, her message short but urgent: \u201cCan you come over? I really need to talk.\u201d I could almost hear the tremor in her voice, and I knew she wouldn\u2019t reach out unless she was truly struggling. Supporting each other was something we\u2019d always promised, especially after our parents split. I started gathering my things, ready to head to her place.\n\nThen, another message popped up\u2014this time from Mark, a guy I\u2019d met at a friend\u2019s party a few months ago. \u201cHey, sorry for the last-minute ask, but could you help me move some boxes tonight? I\u2019m really in a bind.\u201d He\u2019d never asked for anything before, and I knew he didn\u2019t have many people to turn to in the city. As an acquaintance, I felt obligated to help when asked, especially since he\u2019d always been kind to me.\n\nI stood frozen in the hallway, torn between my sister\u2019s emotional need and Mark\u2019s practical request, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
