First, a message from my sister: \u201cCan you come over? I really need to talk.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. I could hear her voice trembling through the text, and I knew she was struggling with her breakup. Before I could reply, my girlfriend called, her voice shaky. \u201cI got the feedback. It was awful. Can you come over?\u201d She\u2019d been working so hard for this promotion, and I could hear the tears she was trying to hold back.\n\nI stared at my phone, heart pounding. My sister and I always promised to be there for each other, no matter what. But my girlfriend needed me too\u2014she\u2019d always said I was her safe place when things got tough. I felt pulled in two directions, both expecting me to be their support, both needing me right now. My mind raced, guilt and worry tangling together as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be there for both of them at the same time."}
