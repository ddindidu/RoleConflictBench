She caught my eye, her look saying everything: we had to get the house spotless before her relatives arrived. I knew she was counting on me to help, to share the load, and I wanted to be the partner she needed. My phone buzzed. It was a message from an acquaintance, inviting me to join a group chat. I hesitated, but joined, only to find the conversation swirling around a mutual colleague\u2019s recent choices. The comments were sharp, bordering on cruel. I felt the expectation to join in, to not stand out by defending someone or staying silent. My wife called from the hallway, asking if I could vacuum next. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one part of me wanting to be present and supportive at home, the other not wanting to alienate myself from the group by refusing to participate in their talk. My hands shook slightly as I dried the last plate, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which demand I should answer first."}
