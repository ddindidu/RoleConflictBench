She pouted, resisting my guidance, and I felt the familiar tug of frustration. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my mentee, apologizing for missing another deadline. I knew she was overwhelmed, juggling work and family, and my role as her mentor was to encourage her growth, not chastise her. But the urge to correct, to impose discipline, lingered from my mothering moments. I felt torn, caught between the need to nurture my daughter\u2019s sense of right and wrong and the expectation to support my mentee\u2019s autonomy and self-discovery. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each requiring a different kind of guidance, and I sat there, heart heavy, unsure which voice to use next."}
