Did you eat? Tell me everything!\u201d I smiled, knowing she\u2019d worry if I didn\u2019t reply soon. Every evening, I made it a point to call or text my parents, sharing little stories and answering their questions. It was our way of staying close, even though I lived away from home now. But tonight, my mind kept drifting to the article my mentor had sent earlier. \u201cNo rush, just thought you\u2019d find it interesting,\u201d she\u2019d said, but I knew she expected me to read it and maybe even bring it up in our next meeting.
