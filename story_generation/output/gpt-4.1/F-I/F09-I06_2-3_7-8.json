My mentor had managed to squeeze in a session for me, just before catching a long flight. I knew how precious her time was, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second. But as I prepared my notes, my phone buzzed with a message from my husband: \u201cWe\u2019re short on groceries. Can you pick up some things? The kids need lunch for school tomorrow.\u201d I stared at the list he sent, calculating the money left in our account. I needed to stop by the store before it closed, or my family would go without essentials. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss the only chance to meet with my mentor for weeks. My mind raced, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the rare opportunity to learn from someone I deeply respected. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
