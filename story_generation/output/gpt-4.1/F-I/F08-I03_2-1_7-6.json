My daughter had just texted me, bubbling with excitement about her new job. She wanted to share every detail, and I knew how much it meant to her that I listened and celebrated with the family. As a grandmother, I always tried to be present, to keep our family close, especially during moments like these.\n\nBut just as I started typing a reply, another message popped up\u2014from my boyfriend. He was upset about a mix-up with our weekend plans, and I could sense his frustration. As his girlfriend, I felt responsible for smoothing things over, for making sure we didn\u2019t let small misunderstandings fester.\n\nI stared at the two conversations, feeling the weight of both expectations. My family needed my warmth and attention, but my relationship needed my patience and reassurance. My fingers hovered over the screen, torn between the joy I wanted to share and the peace I needed to restore, my mind racing with the impossible choice before me."}
