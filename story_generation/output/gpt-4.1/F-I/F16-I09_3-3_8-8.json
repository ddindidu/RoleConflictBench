She was already at the airport, reminding me to keep an eye out for her package, especially since the building\u2019s power would be out for a day. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d help, and I knew she was counting on me. Just as I was about to reply, my spouse walked in, face serious, ready to talk about our mounting medical bills and the tough choices ahead. We\u2019d agreed to be honest and open, to really listen to each other, but my mind kept drifting to Mrs. Lee\u2019s delivery and the logistics of keeping her food from spoiling. My spouse\u2019s voice grew tense, sensing my distraction. I felt torn\u2014my partner needed my full attention and trust, but my neighbor was relying on me too. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I could feel my anxiety rising as I tried to figure out how to be present for both, knowing I couldn\u2019t give either the attention they deserved at the same time."}
