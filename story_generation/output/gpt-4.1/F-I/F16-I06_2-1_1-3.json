She wanted to check in, reminding me to reach out if I had any questions. I did have a small one\u2014something about terminology in the latest project\u2014but it wasn\u2019t urgent. I could probably figure it out on my own, but I knew she expected me to communicate openly, not let things pile up.\n\nJust then, my partner walked in, shoulders slumped, eyes tired. He\u2019d been wrestling with a tough decision at work all week, and tonight he finally wanted to talk. I could see how much he needed me to listen, to offer encouragement and help him sort through his thoughts. I wanted to be fully present for him, to give him the support he deserved.\n\nBut as he started to open up, my mind kept drifting back to my mentor\u2019s message. Should I quickly send her a note, or would that make me seem distracted? If I waited, would I be letting her down? I felt torn, pulled between being the supportive spouse my partner needed and the proactive mentee my mentor expected. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat there, heart racing, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
