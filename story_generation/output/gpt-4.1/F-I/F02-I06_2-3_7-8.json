This was the only chance to discuss the project that could change my career. But as I glanced at the kitchen table, I saw the stack of unpaid bills and my wife\u2019s worried face. We needed groceries, and the rent was due tomorrow. I had promised to visit the bank and sort things out before it closed today. \n\nMy mentor had gone out of his way to fit me in, and I knew how much he valued punctuality and commitment. Missing this session would be disrespectful, maybe even damaging to our relationship. But if I didn\u2019t handle the family finances now, we\u2019d be in real trouble. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest. I felt torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down\u2014either my family or the person guiding my future. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which responsibility to honor."}
