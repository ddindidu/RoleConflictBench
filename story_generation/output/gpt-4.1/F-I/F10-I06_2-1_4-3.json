Just last night, she reminded me how proud she was that I always respected our customs, especially now that the family was paying closer attention. I could almost feel the weight of their expectations pressing on my shoulders. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder from my mentor: \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions, no matter how small.\u201d I did have a question\u2014just a minor confusion about a term in my project. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but my mentor had always stressed the importance of open communication. Yet, I hesitated. In my family, we\u2019re taught not to bother others with trivial matters, to handle small things ourselves. I stared at my phone, torn between honoring my family\u2019s values and meeting my mentor\u2019s expectations. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my heart pounding as I wrestled with which role to honor in this moment."}
