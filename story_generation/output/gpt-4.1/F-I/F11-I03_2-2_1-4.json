It was my sister, her voice trembling, asking if I could come over. She\u2019d had a rough day\u2014her job interview had gone terribly, and she just needed someone to talk to. I glanced at the clock. Tonight was the only evening Alex and I had free before he left for a week-long work trip. We\u2019d been looking forward to this for days, planning to cook together and finally have some time just for us. But my sister rarely asked for help, and I knew how much she counted on me to be there when things fell apart. My heart twisted as I stared at my phone, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to Alex and the unspoken promise I\u2019d always kept with my sister. I could already imagine the disappointment in Alex\u2019s eyes, but I could also hear the vulnerability in my sister\u2019s voice. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which door to walk through."}
