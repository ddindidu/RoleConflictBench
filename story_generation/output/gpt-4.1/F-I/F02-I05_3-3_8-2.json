The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy reminder that I needed to secure our family\u2019s future. My wife had mentioned the rising grocery costs, and I knew every rupee counted. I had planned to spend the evening reviewing our finances, mapping out a plan to ensure we wouldn\u2019t fall behind.\n\nBut just as I opened the spreadsheet, my phone buzzed. It was Arjun, my mentee at work. He was on the verge of making a major career move, and he needed my guidance tonight\u2014he said the decision couldn\u2019t wait. I could hear the anxiety in his voice, the same uncertainty I\u2019d once felt at his age. He depended on me to help him weigh his options, to provide the structured advice that could shape his future.\n\nI stared at the phone, torn. My family needed me to focus on our financial stability, but Arjun needed me to be present as his mentor. The weight of both responsibilities pressed down, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unsure which role to answer first."}
