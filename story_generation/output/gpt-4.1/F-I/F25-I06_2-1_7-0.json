Mom barely touched her dinner, her eyes distant. I knew they\u2019d been working extra shifts, and I felt this urge\u2014almost a duty\u2014to sit with them, ask about their day, maybe even make them laugh. They needed me, I could tell. But as I cleared the plates, my phone buzzed: a reminder about the articles my mentor suggested I read. \u201cNo rush, but they\u2019ll help you grow,\u201d she\u2019d said, and I wanted to impress her, to show I was serious about my future. I could hear my parents\u2019 low voices in the living room, and I felt torn. If I disappeared to my room to read, I\u2019d be letting them down when they needed comfort. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be falling behind, maybe missing a chance to prove myself. My chest tightened as I stood in the hallway, caught between the warmth of my family and the quiet promise of my ambitions, unsure which part of me to honor tonight."}
