This was the last chance to voice concerns before the project\u2019s direction was set in stone. My manager had emphasized how crucial everyone\u2019s input was, and I knew my absence would be noticed. But as I glanced at the stack of bills on the kitchen table, my mind raced. The home loan repayment was looming, and I needed to finalize paperwork with the bank before their office closed today. Missing this window could mean delays, penalties\u2014maybe even risking our financial stability. My son\u2019s drawing, taped to the fridge, caught my eye. I wanted to be the mother who kept our home safe, who never let things slip. But I was also a colleague, part of a team counting on me. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt torn, wishing I could split myself in two. I took a deep breath, phone in hand, caught between dialing into the meeting and rushing out the door to the bank, my mind swirling with the weight of both worlds."}
