My heart pounded with the weight of the numbers\u2014rent, groceries, school fees. I knew I had to pick up extra shifts this week, maybe even ask for an advance, just to keep us afloat. But my phone buzzed again, another message from Mark. He was furious after our argument last night, accusing me of always putting my \u201cnew family\u201d first, of never making time to talk things through. He said if I didn\u2019t come over tonight to resolve things, he didn\u2019t see a future for us. I felt torn in two\u2014my family needed me to be the provider, but Mark needed me to be present, to fight for us. My hands shook as I stared at the bills, the phone, the closed door to the living room. I didn\u2019t know how to be everything to everyone, and the pressure was suffocating."}
