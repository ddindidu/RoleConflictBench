I know how much these calls mean to them, especially since I moved out. They wait all week for my voice, for the comfort of knowing I\u2019m okay. But tonight, my mentee, Sarah, is in crisis. Her big project presentation is tomorrow, and she\u2019s panicking, her confidence unraveling in a flurry of anxious texts. As her mentor, I promised to be there, to help her navigate these moments and grow. She needs me now, more than ever, to talk her through her fears and help her prepare. My parents expect my attention, my warmth, my time. Sarah expects my guidance, my encouragement, my presence. I stare at my phone, torn between the comfort of family and the responsibility I feel toward Sarah. My heart aches with the weight of both roles, knowing I can\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
