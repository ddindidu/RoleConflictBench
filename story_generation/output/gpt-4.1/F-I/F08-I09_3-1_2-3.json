She needed advice\u2014real, heartfelt guidance\u2014about a falling out with her closest friend. She looked to me, her grandmother, for wisdom and comfort, expecting me to listen and help her sort through her tangled feelings. I reached for her hand, ready to give her my full attention, when I glanced out the window and saw my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, struggling with her trash bin. Tomorrow is pickup day, and our bins are only half-full. We\u2019ve always agreed not to overfill one another\u2019s bins or move them without asking, respecting each other\u2019s space and boundaries. I knew she\u2019d appreciate my help, but I also knew she\u2019d be upset if I crossed that line without her say-so. My granddaughter\u2019s voice wavered, pulling me back. I felt torn\u2014my heart tugged in two directions, wanting to be the wise, present grandmother she needed, but also the considerate neighbor I promised to be. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat there, caught between the two, unsure which role to answer first."}
