I glanced at the screen\u2014another message from my mom, asking if I\u2019d eaten and how my day was going. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d keep her updated, especially since Dad\u2019s health scare last month. She worried if I didn\u2019t reply quickly. But right now, I was hunched over my laptop, notes scattered everywhere, preparing slides for my mentees. The project deadline was looming, and they needed this session to get through the final stretch. I\u2019d promised them a thorough walkthrough, and I could already picture their anxious faces, waiting for me to explain the tricky parts. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between typing a reassuring message to my mom and finishing the outline for my mentees. The weight of both promises pressed on me\u2014my parents\u2019 need for connection, my mentees\u2019 need for guidance. I felt the tension coil in my chest, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
