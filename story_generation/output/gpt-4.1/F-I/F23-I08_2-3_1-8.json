She\u2019d been so excited, asking if I\u2019d be there to watch her present her project. I promised I would, knowing how much it meant to her, especially since her mom couldn\u2019t make it. But just as I was about to leave work, my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from an acquaintance, Lisa. She wanted to meet urgently, saying she\u2019d heard something about another parent at the school, something that could \u201cchange everything.\u201d I knew Lisa\u2019s reputation for spreading rumors, and I\u2019d always prided myself on not participating in gossip. Still, she insisted it was important, and I felt the pressure to listen, if only to keep the peace in our social circle. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: be the supportive step-parent my family needed, or the loyal acquaintance who didn\u2019t turn her back when called upon. The clock ticked, and I felt the tension rising, torn between two worlds that suddenly seemed impossible to reconcile."}
