My heart pounded\u2014this was the moment I\u2019d always dreaded as a father. I was supposed to teach him right from wrong, to show him that honesty mattered, even when it was hard. He looked up at me, eyes wide and scared, and I knew he needed guidance, discipline, and reassurance all at once.\n\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Mia, my girlfriend. I\u2019d promised we\u2019d talk through our weekend plans tonight, especially after our earlier misunderstanding. She hated unresolved tension, and I\u2019d told her I\u2019d call as soon as I was free. I could already imagine her disappointment if I didn\u2019t respond soon, the way she\u2019d feel like I was putting her second again.\n\nI felt torn in two\u2014my son needed me to be present, to handle this mistake with care and firmness. But Mia needed me, too, to show her she was important, to resolve our conflict before it grew. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood there, caught between the two people I loved most, unsure which role to answer first."}
