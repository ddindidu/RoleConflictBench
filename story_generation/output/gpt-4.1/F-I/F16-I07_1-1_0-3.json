They looked up and smiled, but I could tell something was off. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, dropping my bag by the door. They shrugged, trying to play it down, but I caught the sigh. I knew they wanted me to sit, listen, maybe offer a hug or a few words of comfort. That\u2019s what I always tried to do\u2014be present, be supportive.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket. A reminder about the report I\u2019d promised to finish for my team. It wasn\u2019t urgent, not really, but I\u2019d told everyone I\u2019d have it done tonight. I could see the emails piling up, the little red badge growing. I felt the tug\u2014my partner needed me, but so did my colleagues, in a way. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in. My partner\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for connection, while my mind raced with unfinished work. I hesitated, caught between the comfort of the living room and the pull of my laptop, not sure which role to step into first."}
