She wanted to know if I\u2019d eaten, how my day was going, and if I\u2019d remembered to send the documents she\u2019d asked for. I always replied quickly, keeping our daily connection strong, but now my mentor was glancing at his watch, clearly pressed for time before his flight. He\u2019d squeezed me in, expecting my full attention and respect for his limited availability. My phone vibrated again, and I felt the familiar tug\u2014my parents counted on these updates, and I didn\u2019t want to worry them. But my mentor\u2019s eyes met mine, waiting for me to focus. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between the comfort of my family\u2019s expectations and the rare opportunity to learn from someone I admired. My fingers hovered over my phone, heart pounding, as I tried to decide which role I owed more in this moment."}
