My husband sat across from me, his brow furrowed, waiting for me to respond to his question about our finances. He wanted honesty, openness\u2014he needed to know if we could afford the treatment his doctor recommended. I could see the worry in his eyes, and I knew this conversation couldn\u2019t wait. But my laptop was open, the meeting link blinking on the screen. My team was counting on me to be present, to contribute to the final discussion before we made decisions that would affect our entire department. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me\u2014my husband\u2019s need for transparency, my colleagues\u2019 need for participation. My heart pounded as I glanced between him and the screen, torn between the two worlds that demanded all of me at the same time."}
