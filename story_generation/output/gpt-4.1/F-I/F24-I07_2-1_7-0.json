My stepbrother, Jamie, was tightening his helmet, eyes fixed on the steep, cracked ramp. He grinned at me, \u201cWatch this, okay?\u201d I knew he\u2019d been practicing for weeks, but the ramp looked rougher than ever, and I could already imagine the scrapes and bruises if he fell. As his step-sibling, I felt responsible for his safety, wanting to be there in case he needed help or encouragement.\n\nBut as a colleague, I was expected to join the meeting, contribute updates, and show my commitment to the team\u2014even if it was just a routine catch-up. The meeting would be recorded, but I knew my absence would be noticed, and I didn\u2019t want to seem unreliable. My heart pounded as I glanced between Jamie, poised at the top of the ramp, and the meeting notification flashing on my screen. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which expectation I should meet as the seconds ticked by."}
