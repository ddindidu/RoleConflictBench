My son bounced into the room, eyes shining with anticipation. \u201cIs today the day, Mom? You promised we\u2019d get the Nintendo after your next paycheck.\u201d His words tugged at my heart, a reminder of my promise and the joy I could bring him. But as I glanced at my phone, a message from my mentee appeared: \u201cCan we talk? I need your advice before tomorrow\u2019s big presentation.\u201d She was counting on me, and I knew how much this project meant for her future. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my son\u2019s happiness and our family\u2019s careful budget, my mentee\u2019s trust and her professional dreams. I wanted to be the mother who kept her promises, the mentor who never let anyone down. But with only so much time and money, I felt myself pulled in two directions, my heart aching as I tried to figure out how to be enough for them both."}
