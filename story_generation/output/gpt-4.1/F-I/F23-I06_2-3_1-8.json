My stepson\u2019s open class was today at 3:00 PM\u2014he\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, asking if I\u2019d be there to see him read his poem. At the same time, my mentor had just messaged: \u201cCan you meet at 3:00? I have an hour before my flight.\u201d I knew how rare it was for her to have time, and she\u2019d squeezed me in despite her packed schedule. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. My partner had reminded me how important it was for the kids to feel supported, especially from me, the new step-parent. But my mentor had always emphasized the importance of commitment and respect for her time. My heart pounded as I imagined my stepson scanning the classroom for my face, and then my mentor, waiting at the caf\u00e9, checking her watch. I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, each demanding a part of me I couldn\u2019t give to both."}
