The deadline wasn\u2019t just a formality\u2014if I missed it, the whole team would be set back, and I knew how much everyone was counting on me. My phone buzzed again. This time, it was my daughter, her voice trembling as she explained that my grandson had been rushed to the hospital. She needed me there, not just as a mother, but as a grandmother\u2014someone steady, comforting, and present. My heart twisted. I could picture my little grandson\u2019s frightened face, and I knew my family expected me to drop everything and be with them. But my mind kept circling back to my colleagues, the project, and the trust they\u2019d placed in me. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore."}
