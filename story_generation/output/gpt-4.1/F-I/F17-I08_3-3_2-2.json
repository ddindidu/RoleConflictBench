I hesitated, feeling the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014my mom had texted, probably checking in as she always did around this time. She liked to hear about my day, every little detail, and I knew she\u2019d worry if I didn\u2019t reply quickly. But Sarah looked so lost, and I remembered how we\u2019d promised to be there for each other, even though we weren\u2019t close friends. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me: my mom\u2019s need for reassurance and connection, and Sarah\u2019s silent plea for comfort. My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between sending a quick update to my mom or putting it away to sit beside Sarah and offer a listening ear. My heart raced as I tried to decide which role to fulfill first, feeling guilty for even having to choose."}
