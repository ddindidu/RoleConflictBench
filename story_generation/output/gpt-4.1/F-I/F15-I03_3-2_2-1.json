The school had just called\u2014my son was caught bullying a classmate. They wanted me to come in, talk to the principal, and help my child understand the seriousness of his actions. I felt a wave of guilt and responsibility; I needed to be there for him, to guide him, to show him right from wrong. But as I hung up, I heard my boyfriend\u2019s voice from the living room, shaky and low. He\u2019d just gotten terrible feedback at work, and I could see the defeat in his eyes. He needed me too\u2014someone to listen, to reassure him, to remind him of his worth. I felt torn in two, pulled by the urgent needs of my child and my partner. Both expected my full attention, my comfort, my presence. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how to be the parent my son needed and the girlfriend my partner deserved, all at the same time."}
