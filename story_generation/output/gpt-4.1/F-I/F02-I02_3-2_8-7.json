The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy weight pressing on my chest. As a father, I knew I had to make sure my family was secure, that we wouldn\u2019t fall behind. Every dollar counted, and I\u2019d been working extra hours, skipping small luxuries, trying to stretch every paycheck. \n\nBut my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from Mia. We\u2019d argued three times this week, always about money. She wanted reassurance, wanted to talk things through, to feel like we were a team. As her boyfriend, I was supposed to listen, to help us find common ground, to resolve the tension. But every conversation left me feeling more trapped, torn between her need for emotional connection and my responsibility to keep the family afloat. \n\nI stared at the phone, heart pounding, knowing she expected a call back.
