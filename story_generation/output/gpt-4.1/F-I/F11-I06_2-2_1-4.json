I really need you.\u201d I could hear the strain in her words, and I knew she\u2019d been having a rough week. As her sister, I always tried to be there, especially when she was struggling. I glanced at my laptop, where lines of code blinked accusingly. The technical issue I\u2019d been wrestling with for hours still wasn\u2019t fixed, and my mentor had emphasized the importance of keeping her updated about any roadblocks. She expected me to reach out as soon as I hit a snag, so we could solve it together and keep the project on track.\n\nI felt torn. If I called my sister, I\u2019d be the support she needed, but I\u2019d have to put off messaging my mentor, risking her disappointment and possibly delaying the project. If I emailed my mentor first, I\u2019d be fulfilling my responsibility as a mentee, but I\u2019d be leaving my sister alone in her moment of need. My chest tightened as I stared at my phone and laptop, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me, unsure which role to answer first."}
