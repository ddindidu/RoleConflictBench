She and Dad expected me to check in every day, to share how work was going, what I\u2019d eaten, even the little things like the weather outside my window. It was our way of staying close, especially since I moved out. I glanced at the clock\u2014if I called her now, I\u2019d miss the start of the meeting, but if I waited, she\u2019d worry or think I was pulling away. \n\nAt work, my manager always emphasized the importance of being present in meetings, even if they were recorded. \u201cParticipation matters,\u201d she\u2019d said last week, \u201cit shows you\u2019re engaged.\u201d I knew my absence would be noticed, even if I watched the recording later. My phone buzzed again\u2014\u201cEverything okay?\u201d My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the warmth of family and the expectations of my team. I could feel the pressure mounting, knowing that whichever choice I made, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
