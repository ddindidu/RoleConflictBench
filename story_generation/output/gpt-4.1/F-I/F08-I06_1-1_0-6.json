She\u2019s starting high school next week and wanted to talk about making friends and handling new responsibilities. As her grandmother, I felt the familiar tug to offer comfort, to share stories from my own youth, to be the steady hand she\u2019s always known. But as she spoke, I glanced at the clock\u2014my mentor\u2019s office hours were about to begin. I\u2019d promised my mentor I\u2019d be there, ready with questions and updates, respecting the time she\u2019d carved out for me. My mentor\u2019s guidance is crucial for my own growth, and I know how much she values commitment and punctuality. The weight of both roles pressed on me: my granddaughter\u2019s need for wisdom and reassurance, and my mentor\u2019s expectation of respect and engagement. My heart ached as I listened, torn between the urge to stay on the line and the responsibility to log in for my mentor. The minutes ticked by, and I felt the conflict sharpen, unsure which role to honor in this moment."}
