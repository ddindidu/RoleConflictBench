She was supposed to be learning to eat neatly, and I knew I should gently correct her, remind her about manners, and help her clean up. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from Mia, my girlfriend, asking if I was ready to leave. It was our last weekend together before she moved abroad, and she wanted every moment to count. I could almost hear her voice, hopeful and a little anxious, wanting me to be fully present with her.\n\nMy daughter looked up at me, waiting for my attention, while Mia\u2019s messages piled up, each one a reminder of how little time we had left. I felt torn, the weight of being a good parent pressing against the pull of being a loving boyfriend.

My heart ached as I sat there, caught between two worlds, both needing me in different ways."}
