My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that Professor Lee\u2019s office hours were starting in ten minutes. She\u2019d made it clear how important it was to be punctual, especially since she was only available for a short window this week. I quickened my pace, glancing at my brother, who was chattering about his day. As we reached the corner, he suddenly let go and darted toward the crosswalk, not even glancing at the traffic light. My heart lurched. I knew I should run after him, shout, do anything to keep him safe. But if I stopped now, I\u2019d miss my chance to talk to Professor Lee about my project, something she\u2019d emphasized was crucial for my progress. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides\u2014my brother\u2019s safety in one hand, my mentor\u2019s expectations in the other. My feet froze on the curb, my mind racing, caught between the two worlds that needed me at the same moment."}
