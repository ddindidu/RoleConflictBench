My grandchild shuffled in, eyes downcast, shoulders slumped. I recognized that look\u2014something was weighing heavily on them. As a grandparent, I felt the urge to reach out, to offer comfort and wisdom, to remind them that life\u2019s storms do pass. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed with a message from my mentor: \u201cAny updates on the project? Let me know if you\u2019re stuck.\u201d The truth was, I was stuck\u2014hopelessly tangled in a technical problem I couldn\u2019t solve alone. I knew I should reply, admit my struggle, and ask for help. Yet, my grandchild needed me in that moment, and I couldn\u2019t bear to let them down. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be present and honest. My heart ached as I sat between them, torn by the impossible choice of who to help first."}
