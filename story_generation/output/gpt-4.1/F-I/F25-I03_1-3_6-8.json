We want to make sure you\u2019re okay, and that we\u2019re okay, too.\u201d I\u2019d nodded, promising myself I\u2019d check in with him and Mom later, ask how things were going, be the glue that kept us together. But now, my phone buzzed with another message from Jamie: \u201cWe need to talk. I can\u2019t keep fighting like this. Are we even good for each other?\u201d My heart pounded. Jamie expected me to fix things, to smooth over the argument that had left us both raw and uncertain. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my parents needed me to be present, to care, to ask about their happiness, while Jamie needed me to step up and save our relationship. I stared at the wall, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one needed me more, or if I could be enough for either."}
