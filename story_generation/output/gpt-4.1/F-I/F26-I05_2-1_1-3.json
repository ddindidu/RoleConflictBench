I could sense her sadness, the way she hesitated to speak, and I wanted nothing more than to offer the right words, to share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. She needed me to be her safe place, her guide, someone who could help her find her way through whatever was troubling her. Just as I opened my mouth to ask what was wrong, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my mentee, who was struggling with a project and needed advice before their next meeting. They relied on my experience, expecting me to be available, even during my breaks. I felt torn\u2014my granddaughter\u2019s silent plea for comfort on one side, and my mentee\u2019s urgent request for guidance on the other. Both needed me, both expected me to be present and wise, but I only had one heart and one moment to give. The weight of their needs pressed on me, and I sat there, caught between the roles that defined me, unsure which to answer first."}
