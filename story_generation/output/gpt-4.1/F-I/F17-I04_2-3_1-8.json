Every week, I call my parents at this time. They wait for my call, eager to hear about my week, to know I\u2019m okay, to share their own stories. I know how much it means to them, especially since I moved out. But tonight, my mind is tangled with guilt. Just an hour ago, I realized something I said to my friend earlier was taken the wrong way. I saw the hurt in their eyes, and now I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I need to call and apologize\u2014right now\u2014before the misunderstanding grows. My parents expect me to be present, to listen and share, but my friend needs me to reach out and make things right. I clutch my phone, torn between the comfort of routine and the urgency of mending a friendship, my heart pounding as I try to decide who needs me more in this moment."}
