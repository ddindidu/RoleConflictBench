It\u2019s a ritual\u2014one I know means a lot to them, especially since I moved out for work. Tonight, though, my mind is elsewhere. My mentor, Dr. Lee, sent me a list of articles to read. \u201cNo rush,\u201d she said, but I know she expects me to be prepared for our next meeting. The reading isn\u2019t due for weeks, but I want to impress her, to show I\u2019m committed.\n\nAs I stare at my phone, I see the time ticking closer to when I usually call home. My parents will be waiting, probably already sitting together, eager to hear about my week. But the articles are open on my laptop, and I feel the pressure to get ahead, to not let Dr. Lee down. I can\u2019t focus on either task, guilt gnawing at me. If I call my parents, I\u2019ll be distracted, thinking about the reading. If I dive into the articles, I\u2019ll imagine my parents\u2019 disappointment when the phone doesn\u2019t ring. I sit at my desk, torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
