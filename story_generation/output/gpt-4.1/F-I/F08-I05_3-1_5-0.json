My daughter\u2019s voice trembled over the call, asking if I could come over\u2014something serious had happened, and the family needed me. My heart ached; as a grandmother, I knew my presence mattered, especially in moments like these. I glanced at my calendar, where I\u2019d marked a meeting with one of my mentees, Julia. She\u2019d asked for advice about a job offer, and though our talks were usually informal, she\u2019d sounded anxious this time. I could hear the hope in her voice when she said, \u201cI really need your guidance.\u201d \n\nThe weight of both roles pressed on me. My family expected me to be the steady anchor, the one who could comfort and help them through crises. Julia, meanwhile, looked to me for wisdom, trusting I\u2019d help her make the right choice. I felt torn, guilt creeping in no matter which way I leaned. My hands trembled as I stared at the phone, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
