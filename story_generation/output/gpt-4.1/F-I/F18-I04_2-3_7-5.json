He\u2019d been practicing for weeks, and today he was determined to land the trick he\u2019d been talking about nonstop. As his older sibling, I knew I should stay close, ready to step in if he fell or got hurt. Just as he set his board down, my phone buzzed. It was a frantic call from my best friend\u2014her car had broken down on the highway, miles away, and she sounded scared. She needed me to come get her right away. My heart pounded as I looked from my brother, poised to take a risk, to my phone, my friend\u2019s desperate voice echoing in my mind. Both needed me, right now, in different ways. I felt torn, guilt and worry twisting inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
