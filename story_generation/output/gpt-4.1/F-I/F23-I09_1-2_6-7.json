My stepson, Ethan, bounced around the living room, reminding me for the third time that I\u2019d promised him a Nintendo if he kept his grades up. He had, and now he looked at me with those hopeful eyes, expecting me to keep my word. But the price tag gnawed at me\u2014money was tight, and I needed to make sure we had enough for bills and groceries.\n\nJust then, Mrs. Patel from next door called. She sounded anxious, asking if I could check in on her tonight in case the power went out. She lived alone, and her children were out of town. I knew she relied on neighbors for help, especially during storms. I felt the weight of her expectation, the unspoken trust that I\u2019d be there for her.\n\nMy mind spun between Ethan\u2019s excitement and Mrs. Patel\u2019s vulnerability. I wanted to be the reliable step-parent who kept promises, but also the good neighbor who didn\u2019t let someone down in a crisis. The storm clouds outside seemed to mirror the turmoil inside me as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
