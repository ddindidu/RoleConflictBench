My daughter has already called twice this week, reminding me how much the grandkids are looking forward to our annual tradition of baking cookies together. I know how important it is to be present, to keep the family close, especially now that everyone is so busy. Just as I\u2019m about to call my son to confirm the menu, my phone buzzes with a message from my old friend, Linda. She\u2019s in the middle of assembling a new bookshelf, and the instructions have her completely flustered. \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call?\u201d she pleads. I can hear the stress in her voice\u2014she\u2019s always been there for me in a pinch, and I want to be there for her now. But I also know my family expects me to be available, to help keep our traditions alive. My heart tugs in two directions, torn between the warmth of family and the loyalty of friendship, both needing me at the same moment."}
