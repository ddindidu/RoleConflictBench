It\u2019s important for our family.\u201d The weight of tradition pressed on my shoulders, and I could already picture my relatives\u2019 expectant faces, waiting for me to recite the prayers perfectly, to honor our ancestors as they always had. Just as I tried to steady my nerves, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a friend, asking me to come over and help welcome a new neighbor who was painfully shy. \u201cYou\u2019re always so easy to talk to,\u201d she wrote. \u201cCan you help make her feel comfortable?\u201d I knew how much it meant to be warm and open, to help someone feel at ease in a new place. But the thought of splitting my attention, of possibly disappointing my family or failing to be the friendly face my acquaintance needed, made my stomach twist. I could feel the expectations pulling me in opposite directions, each one important, each one demanding a different part of me."}
