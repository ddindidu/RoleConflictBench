My mom had sounded tired when I called earlier, her voice thin as she mentioned Dad\u2019s recent health scare. I knew she needed me to check in, to ask if everything was okay at home, to be the son who listens and reassures. But as I hung up, my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, it was my girlfriend. She\u2019d just lost her uncle, and her messages were raw with grief. She needed me, too, to be present, to hold her through the storm of her loss.\n\nI stared at the screen, torn. My parents expected me to be their anchor, to show I cared about what was happening at home. My girlfriend needed me to be her safe place, to help her carry her pain. I could feel the tension building inside me, the fear of letting someone down. My heart ached, caught between two calls for comfort, unsure which way to turn."}
