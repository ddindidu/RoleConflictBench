She\u2019d just started her new job, and the family group chat buzzed with her excitement. As her grandmother, I knew how much it meant to her that I respond quickly, to share in her joy and offer encouragement. But just as I began to type, my email pinged\u2014a message from my mentee, desperate for last-minute advice before a pivotal interview. As a mentor, I was expected to be present, insightful, and supportive, especially now when my guidance could shape her future. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of family, the responsibility of mentorship. I could almost hear my granddaughter\u2019s voice, eager for my pride, while my mentee\u2019s anxious words echoed in my mind, hoping for reassurance. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each deserving it. I stared at the phone, torn, feeling the ache of wanting to be everything for everyone, yet knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
