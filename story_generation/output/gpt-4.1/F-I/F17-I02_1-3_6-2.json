My mom had texted, \u201cCan we talk tonight? Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I knew she needed me to check in, to ask if everything was okay at home, to be the steady presence I\u2019d always tried to be for them. But my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, it was Mia. Her message was raw: \u201cI can\u2019t stop crying. Can you call?\u201d She\u2019d lost her brother just days ago, and I\u2019d promised to be there for her, to listen, to hold her together when she felt like falling apart.\n\nMy chest tightened. I wanted to be the son who noticed when things weren\u2019t right at home, who made sure my parents felt supported. But I also wanted to be the boyfriend Mia needed, the one who could help her through the worst pain she\u2019d ever known. Both needed me now, and I felt pulled in two directions, guilt and worry twisting inside me as I tried to decide who to call first."}
