My partner\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, a gentle reminder that we agreed to share the chores, and it\u2019s my turn to fold. I nod, guilt prickling at my skin, but my phone buzzes with a message from Maya, my mentee at work. She\u2019s stuck on a project and needs advice\u2014just a quick question, she promises, like always. I know how much she relies on me, how much I want to be the mentor I never had. But the laundry sits there, a testament to my promise at home. My mind races, torn between the comfort of being present for my partner and the satisfaction of guiding Maya. Both expect me to show up, to be reliable, to care. I hover in the hallway, phone in hand, heart pounding, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
