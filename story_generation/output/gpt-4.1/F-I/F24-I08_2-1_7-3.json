As his step-sibling, I knew I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t do anything reckless. My heart pounded as he tightened his helmet, clearly set on trying a trick he\u2019d never landed before. I wanted to call out, to tell him to wait, to be careful, but just then, my phone buzzed. It was Jamie, a classmate I barely knew, asking for a quick restaurant recommendation nearby. As an acquaintance, I felt obligated to respond, to be helpful and friendly, especially since Jamie had always been polite to me. But Max was already rolling toward the ramp, and I could see the uneven surface that could send him flying. My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between warning Max and replying to Jamie. The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding my attention, and I felt frozen, caught between the expectations of being a good step-sibling and a considerate acquaintance."}
