The project deadline was looming, and I knew how much they depended on my guidance to navigate the final hurdles. Just as I was outlining the key points, my daughter spilled her juice across the floor. She looked up at me, wide-eyed, waiting for my reaction. I remembered my promise to teach her about responsibility and how to handle mistakes. She needed me to be present, to guide her gently through cleaning up and learning from the accident. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the mentoring session was in ten minutes. My mentees expected me to be focused, to share my experience and help them succeed. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be the best version of myself. My heart raced as I glanced between my daughter and my laptop, torn by the impossible choice."}
