I really need you.\u201d She\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be more patient, more understanding\u2014she deserved that from me. But then, another message popped up from Alex: \u201cHey, let\u2019s do something tonight! I miss you.\u201d We\u2019d both finally found a week with free evenings, and I knew he was hoping for more time together, just us. I wanted to be the supportive sister, to listen without judgment, to show her I respected her feelings. But I also wanted to be the girlfriend who made Alex feel special, who didn\u2019t always put him second. My heart twisted as I weighed their needs against my own. I could almost hear my sister\u2019s voice, fragile and hopeful, and Alex\u2019s, warm and expectant. I wished I could split myself in two, but I couldn\u2019t. My thumb hovered over the screen, torn between two worlds, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me."}
