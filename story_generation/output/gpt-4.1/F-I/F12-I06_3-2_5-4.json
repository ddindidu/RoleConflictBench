My husband\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that his parents would arrive in two hours. The house needed to be spotless, and I was supposed to help with every detail\u2014vacuuming, setting the table, making sure everything looked perfect. I could feel the weight of his expectation, the silent plea for partnership in making a good impression.\n\nBut my phone buzzed on the counter, a reminder of the other world tugging at me. My mentor had sent a message, asking for an update on the project. I\u2019d hit a technical wall days ago, and I knew I was supposed to reach out immediately, to communicate any obstacles so we could troubleshoot together. I could almost hear her disappointment if I stayed silent any longer.\n\nMy mind raced, torn between the urgent need to be present as a wife and the professional responsibility to be honest and proactive as a mentee. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood frozen, hands dripping, heart pounding, unable to move in either direction."}
