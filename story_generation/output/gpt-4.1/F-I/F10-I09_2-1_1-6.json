It\u2019s our ritual\u2014my mom expects to hear my voice, to know I\u2019m okay, to share her stories and ask about mine. Today, as I settle in with my phone, I remember Mrs. Lee next door mentioned she\u2019s expecting an important package. She\u2019s at work, and she asked if I could keep an eye out for the delivery. I promised I would, knowing how much she worries about missed packages.\n\nAs I dial my parents, I glance at the window, watching for the delivery truck. My mom answers, her voice warm and eager, and I feel the familiar tug of comfort and responsibility. But my mind keeps drifting to the front porch, ears straining for the sound of footsteps or the doorbell. I want to give my parents my full attention, to listen and share, but I also don\u2019t want to let Mrs. Lee down. The pressure builds inside me\u2014torn between being the attentive daughter my parents expect and the reliable neighbor Mrs. Lee needs. I grip the phone tighter, heart pounding, caught between two promises I don\u2019t want to break."}
