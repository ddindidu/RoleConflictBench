They always said it meant the world to them, and I knew how much they looked forward to these calls. But as I reached for my phone, my mentee, Sarah, appeared at my office door, her face anxious. \u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d she asked, holding a notebook. She\u2019d been struggling with a project, and I\u2019d promised to help whenever she needed guidance. I glanced at the clock\u2014if I delayed the call, my parents would worry, but if I brushed Sarah off, I\u2019d be letting her down. My mind raced, torn between the comfort my parents expected and the support Sarah needed. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my presence, each deserving my attention. My hand hovered over my phone, heart pounding, caught between being a good son and a reliable mentor."}
