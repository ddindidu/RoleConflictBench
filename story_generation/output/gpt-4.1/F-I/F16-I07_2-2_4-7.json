My spouse had mentioned this morning how the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow, and I nodded, determined to do my part. But as I reach for the detergent, my phone buzzes insistently. It\u2019s my team\u2019s group chat\u2014three new messages, all asking for clarification on the project update I was supposed to send out. I know they\u2019re waiting, probably stalled until I reply. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in: the unspoken agreement at home that I\u2019ll handle the laundry tonight, and the professional standard that I\u2019ll be responsive and reliable. My mind races, torn between the comfort of my family\u2019s routine and the urgency of my colleagues\u2019 needs. I stand in the hallway, laundry basket in one hand, phone in the other, heart pounding as I wrestle with which role to answer first."}
