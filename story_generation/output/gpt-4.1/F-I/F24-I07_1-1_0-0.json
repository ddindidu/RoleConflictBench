My stepbrother, Alex, was hunched over his textbooks at the kitchen table, his hands trembling as he tried to focus. He\u2019d barely slept, and I could see the anxiety etched on his face. I knew he needed me\u2014someone to talk to, someone to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. That\u2019s what we promised each other when our parents married: to be there, especially when things got tough.\n\nBut my laptop chimed, reminding me of the team meeting starting in five minutes. As a colleague, I was expected to show up, contribute, and be present, even if today\u2019s meeting was just a routine catch-up. Sure, it would be recorded, but I knew my manager valued participation, and I didn\u2019t want to seem disengaged.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. Should I sit with Alex, offering the comfort he needed, or log in to the meeting and fulfill my professional duty? The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I found myself frozen, unable to choose, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
