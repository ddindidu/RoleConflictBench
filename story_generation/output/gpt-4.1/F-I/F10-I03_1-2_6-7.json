My mom had texted, \u201cCan we talk tonight? Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I knew she wanted me to check in, to be the daughter who listens and reassures, who asks if everything is okay at home. But my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, it was from my boyfriend. \u201cWe need to talk about the bills. I can\u2019t keep arguing like this.\u201d My heart tightened. We\u2019d fought three times this week about money, and I knew he expected me to help fix things, to be the understanding girlfriend who could smooth things over. I felt pulled in two directions, both needing me to be their anchor. I wanted to be there for my parents, to offer comfort, but I also needed to resolve things with him before the tension grew worse. My fingers hovered over the screen, torn between calling my mom or replying to him first, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
