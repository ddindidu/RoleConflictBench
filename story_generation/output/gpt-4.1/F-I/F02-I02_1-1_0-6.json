I promised them I\u2019d be there, just like every Friday. But my phone buzzed again, a string of messages from Mia lighting up the screen. She was upset about our weekend plans, thinking I\u2019d forgotten our anniversary dinner. I could hear the frustration in her words, and I knew she expected me to call, to talk things through and reassure her. \n\nMy heart pounded as I weighed the demands. If I called Mia now, I might be late picking up the kids, letting them down and breaking my promise. But if I left her waiting, the misunderstanding might fester, making things worse between us. Both needed me, both expected me to show up in different ways. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, torn between the two worlds I cared about most."}
