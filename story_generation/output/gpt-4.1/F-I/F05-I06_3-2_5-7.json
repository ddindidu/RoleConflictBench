My wife\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that her cousins would arrive in two hours and the guest room still needed vacuuming. I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation\u2014this was our home, our shared responsibility, and she was counting on me to help make everything perfect. My phone buzzed. A message from Dr. Lee, my mentor: \u201cI have 30 minutes free at 3 PM. Can you make it?\u201d I knew how rare it was for him to carve out time, especially today. He\u2019d been clear\u2014if I wanted to grow, I needed to show commitment and respect his schedule. I glanced at the clock. If I left for the meeting, I\u2019d leave my wife to handle the rest alone. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss a crucial chance to learn from Dr. Lee. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the impossible pull between being a good husband and a dedicated mentee."}
