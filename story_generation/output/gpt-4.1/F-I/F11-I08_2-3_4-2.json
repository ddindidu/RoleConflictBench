Everyone has to be there.\u201d My mom\u2019s message was clear\u2014no excuses. As the eldest sister, I knew how much it meant to her that we all sat together, even if just for one evening. I could already picture my little brother\u2019s jokes and my dad\u2019s stories, the warmth of being together. I was about to leave work when I noticed Anna, an acquaintance from another department, sitting alone in the break room, her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. I hesitated, remembering how we\u2019d chatted a few times, how she always smiled at me in the hallway. I felt the pull to go over, to offer comfort, to be the friendly, supportive person I always tried to be. But the clock was ticking, and my family would be waiting. My heart pounded as I stood in the doorway, torn between the expectation to be a present, caring sister and the urge to be a compassionate acquaintance. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
