My sister\u2019s text was desperate\u2014she\u2019d just broken up with her boyfriend and wanted me to come over. She never asked for help unless she really needed it. At the same time, my girlfriend was waiting for me at the caf\u00e9, her suitcase already packed for her move abroad. This was our last weekend together for months, and we\u2019d planned every moment. She\u2019d been counting on me to make it special, to show her how much I\u2019d miss her. My sister, though, was alone and hurting, and I\u2019d always promised to be there for her no matter what. I could feel the weight of both their expectations pressing down on me, my heart pulled in two directions. I wanted to be the brother who never let his sister down, and the boyfriend who made his partner feel cherished. But I couldn\u2019t be both at once. My hands shook as I tried to decide who needed me more."}
