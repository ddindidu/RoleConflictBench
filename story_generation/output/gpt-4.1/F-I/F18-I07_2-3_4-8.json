My younger sister waved me over, her eyes bright with excitement\u2014she\u2019d been looking forward to this family dinner all week. I knew how much it meant to her, and to my parents, that I was present and engaged, not just physically there but really part of the evening. As I settled in, my phone buzzed again. It was an email from my manager, marked urgent. Leadership needed my confirmation on a project detail for an external partner, and the message made it clear they expected a prompt reply. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: my family expecting my undivided attention, my colleagues needing my immediate response. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s laughter and the professional responsibility demanding my focus. I felt the tension rising, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
