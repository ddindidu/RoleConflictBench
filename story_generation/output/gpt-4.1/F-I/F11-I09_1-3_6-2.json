Can I come?\u201d she asked, hopeful. I hesitated, remembering how we\u2019d promised to include each other more, to build that mutual respect we\u2019d sometimes let slip. But just as I was about to answer, Mrs. Patel from down the hall approached, her lips pressed in a thin line. \u201cExcuse me, could I have a word?\u201d she said, glancing at my sister and then back at me. I knew immediately what it was about\u2014the noise complaint that had been circulating. As a neighbor, I was expected to be friendly and polite, especially now, face-to-face in the lobby. I felt my stomach twist. My sister looked at me, waiting for my answer, while Mrs. Patel waited for my attention. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something different, and I stood there, caught between the expectations of being a good sister and a considerate neighbor, unsure which way to turn."}
