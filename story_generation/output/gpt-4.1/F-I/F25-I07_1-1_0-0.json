Hope you\u2019re okay!\u201d I know she worries if I don\u2019t check in, and my dad always says it means a lot to her when I reach out. I start typing a reply, but just then, my work calendar pings\u2014a reminder for the weekly team catch-up. It\u2019s not urgent, and the meeting will be recorded, but my manager always expects everyone to show up and contribute, even on weekends. I can already picture the awkward silence if I\u2019m not there to give my project update. My thumb hovers over the \u201cJoin Meeting\u201d button, but I can\u2019t shake the guilt of leaving my stepmom\u2019s message unanswered. I feel torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. I want to be a good stepchild, to show I care, but I also don\u2019t want to let my team down or seem disengaged. My heart races as I stare at my phone, caught between two worlds, unsure which one to choose."}
