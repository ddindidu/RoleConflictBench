My wife had just reminded me that the rent was due next week, and the kids needed new shoes for school. I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down on me\u2014my family depended on me to keep everything afloat. Just as I started calculating what we could cut back on, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mark, my old college friend. \u201cRough day. Everything feels pointless. Can you talk?\u201d I stared at the screen, torn. Mark had always been there for me, and I knew he needed someone to listen, someone to remind him he mattered. But my head was already spinning with worry about money, and I wasn\u2019t sure I could give him the support he deserved. I wanted to be the friend he needed, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the urgent needs of my family. My thumb hovered over the reply button, my heart caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more in this moment."}
