I promised I\u2019d be there, picturing the joy of being surrounded by family, sharing in whatever milestone Eli was about to announce. Just as I hung up, Mrs. Patel from next door knocked, suitcase in hand. She was leaving for her sister\u2019s and asked if I could keep an eye out for her deliveries, especially with the power outage scheduled for tonight. \u201cIf anything arrives, could you bring it in? I\u2019m expecting some important medication.\u201d I assured her I\u2019d help, but as she left, a knot formed in my stomach. The family dinner and the outage would overlap. If a package came, I\u2019d need to be here. My family expects me to be present, to celebrate together, but Mrs. Patel is counting on me, too. I sat by the window, torn, the weight of both promises pressing on me, unsure how I could possibly fulfill them both."}
