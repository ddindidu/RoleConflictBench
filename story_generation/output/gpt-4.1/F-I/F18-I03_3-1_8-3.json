My heart skipped a beat as I saw a car speeding down the road, and I instinctively reached out to grab his arm, but he was already a step ahead. At that moment, my phone buzzed with a message from Mia, my girlfriend. She wanted to know which evening I\u2019d pick for our date this week\u2014she was excited, and I could almost hear her voice through the text, hoping I\u2019d choose tonight. I felt torn. As a sister, I needed to keep my brother safe, to scold him gently and make sure he understood the danger. But as a girlfriend, I wanted to be present and enthusiastic, to show Mia she was my priority. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen on the sidewalk, caught between the urge to protect my brother and the desire to make my girlfriend happy, unsure which role to answer first."}
