She\u2019s been working so hard, and I promised I\u2019d be there early to help set up and make her day special. At the same time, my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, is leaving for a week-long trip and asked if I could keep an eye on her apartment, especially since there\u2019s a planned power outage in the building. She\u2019s expecting a couple of important packages, and she\u2019s always been there for me\u2014watering my plants, checking my mail when I\u2019m away. I want to support my sister and be the reliable brother she counts on, but I also don\u2019t want to let down Mrs. Lee, who trusts me as a good neighbor. The thought of disappointing either of them makes my stomach twist. I keep replaying their requests in my mind, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure how I can possibly meet everyone\u2019s expectations at once."}
