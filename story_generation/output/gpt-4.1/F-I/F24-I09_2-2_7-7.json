He was determined to land a new skateboard trick, but the ramp looked even more treacherous after last night\u2019s rain. As his step-sibling, I knew Mom expected me to look out for him, to keep him safe, especially since he\u2019d already sprained his wrist last month. I wanted to tell him to wait, to practice somewhere safer, but he was already rolling his board to the edge.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a weather alert: a storm was coming tonight, and Mrs. Lee, our elderly neighbor, lived alone just down the hall. She always asked me to check in before storms, sometimes to help move her plants or just to make sure she had candles and water. I could see her lights on through her window, and I knew she\u2019d be expecting me soon.\n\nI felt torn, my chest tight. If I left my stepbrother now, he might get hurt. But if I ignored Mrs. Lee, she\u2019d be alone and worried as the storm rolled in. Both needed me, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
