He was upset that I\u2019d forgotten our plans for Saturday, and his words stung with disappointment. At the same time, my granddaughter, Lily, sat across from me, her eyes wide and searching. \u201cGrandma, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling with uncertainty. I could feel the weight of her trust, the expectation that I would have the wisdom to guide her through this confusing time. But my mind kept drifting to Mark\u2019s texts, the pressure to smooth things over and reassure him that he mattered. I wanted to be present for Lily, to offer her the comfort and insight she needed, but my heart was pulled in two directions. The urge to resolve the tension with Mark gnawed at me, while the responsibility to be the steady, wise grandmother pressed just as hard. I took a deep breath, feeling the ache of being needed in two places at once, unsure which role to answer first."}
