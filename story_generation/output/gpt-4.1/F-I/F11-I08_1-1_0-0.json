As I turned the corner, I spotted Emily, a colleague I barely knew, coming toward me. She looked upset, her eyes red as if she\u2019d been crying. I remembered how important it was to be approachable and friendly, especially since we\u2019d only exchanged a few words before. I felt the urge to stop and ask if she was okay, to offer a smile or a kind word.\n\nBut just then, my phone buzzed with a message from my sister: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to celebrate with you! You\u2019re the only one I want to share this with first.\u201d I knew how much it meant to her that I was there, fully present, supporting her. Yet, I also felt the pull of being a good acquaintance, not wanting to seem cold or indifferent to Emily\u2019s distress. My heart pounded as I slowed my steps, torn between rushing to my sister and pausing to reach out to someone who might need a friend."}
