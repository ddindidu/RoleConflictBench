We\u2019d promised each other to split the chores evenly, to make sure the house looked perfect. But my phone buzzed with a calendar alert: the team meeting was about to start. This wasn\u2019t just any meeting\u2014it was the one where the project\u2019s direction would be discussed, and I was expected to contribute. My manager had emphasized how important everyone\u2019s input was, and I knew missing it would mean being out of the loop, maybe even letting my team down. I could feel my spouse\u2019s eyes on me, silently pleading for help with the last-minute cleaning. My heart pounded as I dried my hands, torn between the duty to my partner and the responsibility to my colleagues, both expecting my full presence at the same time."}
