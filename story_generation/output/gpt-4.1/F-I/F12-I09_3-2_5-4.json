The house was a mess, and I knew he expected me to help scrub every corner, arrange the living room, and make sure everything looked perfect. As I started vacuuming, I heard my dog barking loudly in the hallway. I rushed out, only to see Mrs. Lee from next door frowning as she tried to get past. She\u2019s mentioned before how the barking disturbs her, especially when her grandkids visit. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach\u2014on one hand, I needed to keep the house spotless and help my husband, but on the other, I had to keep the hallway quiet and respect my neighbor\u2019s peace. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between calming my dog and getting back to the chores, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
