He\u2019d been distant lately, and I knew Mom was worried. I wanted to ask if everything was okay, to show him I cared, but I hesitated, unsure if he\u2019d open up to me. Just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed. It was my best friend, calling. I answered, and immediately heard the strain in their voice. \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now,\u201d they said, their words trembling. My heart twisted. I glanced at my stepdad, who looked more alone than ever, and then back at my phone, hearing my friend\u2019s muffled sobs. Both needed me\u2014one silently, the other desperately. I felt torn, the weight of their expectations pressing on me from both sides, unsure who needed me more in that moment."}
