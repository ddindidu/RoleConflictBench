My mom looked tired, her eyes lingering on the window as she washed the dishes. I knew I should ask her if everything was okay\u2014she\u2019d been quiet all evening, and I could sense something was off. As her daughter, I felt this pull to check in, to be the one she could lean on, especially since Dad was working late again. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone vibrated again. It was Mia, my best friend, texting in a panic: \u201cHey, are we meeting at the caf\u00e9 or the park? I\u2019m already out and confused!\u201d We\u2019d had a misunderstanding earlier, and I knew if I didn\u2019t reply right now, she\u2019d feel even more lost and maybe even hurt. I stared at my mom, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be there for my mom, to ask her how she was really doing, but I also needed to clear things up with Mia before she started to worry. My heart raced as I tried to decide which role to answer first."}
