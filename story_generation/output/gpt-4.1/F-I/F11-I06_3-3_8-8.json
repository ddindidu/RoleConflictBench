We\u2019d argued earlier, and she wanted to talk things through, to clear the air before the tension grew. I knew how important it was to communicate openly, to show her I respected her feelings and valued our relationship. But at the same time, my mentor had just messaged, confirming she could squeeze in a session with me before her flight. She\u2019d made time for me in her packed schedule, and I didn\u2019t want to waste her effort or seem ungrateful. My heart pounded as I weighed the phone in my hand, torn between answering my sister\u2019s call and logging into the video session. Both expected my full attention, both deserved my respect. I felt the pressure mounting, guilt and anxiety twisting together as I tried to figure out how to be a good sister and a good mentee at the same time."}
