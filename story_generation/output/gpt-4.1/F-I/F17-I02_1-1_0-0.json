My mom texted me earlier, just a simple \u201cHow are you? Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d I know she worries if I don\u2019t check in, and I can almost hear her voice in my head, gentle but insistent. I start typing a reply, but then I notice my girlfriend across the room, her shoulders tense as she scrolls through her work emails. She\u2019s been quiet since she got home, and I can tell she\u2019s had a rough day. I want to go over, sit beside her, and ask what\u2019s wrong, maybe make her laugh or just listen. But my mom\u2019s message tugs at me\u2014I haven\u2019t called her all week, and I know she\u2019ll be disappointed if I don\u2019t respond soon. I feel pulled in two directions, wanting to be the caring son my parents expect and the supportive boyfriend my partner needs. My thumb hovers over the screen, my heart caught between two worlds, unsure which one to step into first."}
