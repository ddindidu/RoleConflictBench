I could see the hurt in their eyes before they left, and I knew I needed to call and apologize before things got worse. Just as I was about to dial, my stepdad sat down beside me, his face drawn and tired. He started talking, voice trembling, about how overwhelmed he felt at work and how lonely he\u2019d been since Mom started her new job. He looked at me, searching for comfort, and I could feel the weight of his need for support pressing down on me. My phone buzzed in my hand\u2014my friend, probably waiting for me to reach out. I felt torn in two, my heart aching for both of them, knowing I couldn\u2019t be what they needed at the same time."}
