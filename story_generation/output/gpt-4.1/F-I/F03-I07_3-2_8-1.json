My phone buzzed with a reminder, and I could already see the notifications piling up from my colleagues. This meeting was crucial\u2014our manager had said the updates would only be shared live, and everyone\u2019s input was needed.

She started talking, her voice trembling as she shared something deeply personal that had been weighing on her. My dad hovered nearby, looking to me for support, hoping I\u2019d say something comforting. I could feel their need for me to be present, to listen, to reassure them.\n\nBut the clock was ticking.
