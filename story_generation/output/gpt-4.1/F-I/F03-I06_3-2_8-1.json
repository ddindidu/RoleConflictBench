My mentor had just emailed, reminding me that the code sample needed to be finished before our next meeting. I knew how important it was to show progress, to prove I was serious about learning. But just as I started typing, I heard my mom\u2019s voice from the living room\u2014soft, shaky. I found her and Dad sitting together, her eyes red. She started talking about how overwhelmed she felt lately, how the weight of everything seemed too much. Dad looked at me, silently asking for help. I could feel their need for comfort, for me to be present, to listen and reassure them. But my mind kept drifting back to the unfinished code, the deadline looming. I wanted to be the son they needed, to offer support, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my mentor down. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I sat there, torn, not knowing which role to answer first."}
