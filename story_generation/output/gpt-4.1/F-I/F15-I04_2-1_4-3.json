I knew I needed to teach him about behaving in public, about respecting others\u2019 space and listening when I called his name. I could feel the eyes of other shoppers, expecting me to step in, to be the parent who sets boundaries and teaches discipline. Just as I was about to call him back, my phone buzzed. It was my friend, Sarah, her name flashing with a message: \u201cCan you do a quick video call? I\u2019m stuck with this bookshelf and the instructions make no sense.\u201d She\u2019d just moved in, and I\u2019d promised to help whenever she needed it. I could hear the stress in her voice, and I knew she was counting on me to be there, to be the friend who shows up in a pinch. My son was still running, laughter echoing down the aisle, and I stood there, phone in hand, torn between the lesson I needed to teach and the support I\u2019d promised to give. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides."}
