It was Mia, my best friend, her voice shaky. She was on her way to the airport, convinced she\u2019d left her passport at home. \u201cCan you check? If it\u2019s here, can you bring it? My flight\u2019s in two hours,\u201d she pleaded. I glanced at the clock\u2014dinner was about to start, and my parents had been looking forward to this family night for weeks. As a sister, I knew how much it meant to them for me to be present, to laugh and share stories at the table. But as a friend, I couldn\u2019t ignore Mia\u2019s panic; she had no one else to call, and missing her flight would be a disaster. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the warmth of my family and the urgent need of my friend, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
