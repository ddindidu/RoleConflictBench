I knew she\u2019d been worried lately\u2014dad\u2019s job was uncertain, and the house felt heavy with unspoken tension. I wanted to ask if she was okay, to let her know I was there for her, but just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Lee next door, reminding me to keep an eye out for her package while she was away, especially since the power would be out tomorrow. She trusted me, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. But at the same time, I could see my parents needed me, too. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014should I stay close to home, checking in on my parents, or should I make sure I was available to help Mrs. Lee, maybe even running up and down the stairs in the dark to check for her delivery? The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which need was greater."}
