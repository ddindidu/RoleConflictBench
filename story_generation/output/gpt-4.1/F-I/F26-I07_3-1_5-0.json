My daughter\u2019s message was urgent\u2014my grandson had a high fever, and they needed me to help at home. As a grandparent, I knew how much my presence mattered, especially in moments like this. I could already picture his flushed cheeks and the way he clings to me when he\u2019s unwell. But just as I was about to grab my keys, my work calendar popped up a reminder: our weekly team meeting was about to start. As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute, to show my commitment to the team. Even though the meeting would be recorded, I knew my absence would be noticed, and I worried about letting my coworkers down. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my family who needed me, and toward my team who counted on me. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
