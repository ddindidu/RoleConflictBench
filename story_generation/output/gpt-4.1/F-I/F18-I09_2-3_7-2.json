He was determined to try a new trick on the steep, cracked ramp, and I knew how much it meant to him. As his sibling, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014if anything happened to him, I\u2019d never forgive myself. Just as he started to climb the ramp, my phone buzzed. It was a reminder about the meeting in the lobby with Mrs. Lee, our neighbor, who had been upset about the noise from the park. As a neighbor, I was expected to be polite and understanding, to show that I cared about the community\u2019s peace. But how could I leave my brother alone at a risky moment? My heart pounded as I glanced between him and the lobby doors, torn between protecting my brother and showing respect to my neighbor. The pressure from both sides squeezed my chest, and I felt paralyzed, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
