Her eyes were red, and she started talking about how overwhelmed she felt at work, how she sometimes wondered if she was good enough. I could see how much she needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the son she could lean on. I reached out to hold her hand, trying to find the right words to comfort her.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with a message from an acquaintance, Mark. He was venting about a colleague, saying she was dragging the team down and hinting that I must have noticed it too. I knew Mark expected me to agree or at least not contradict him, but I hated the idea of talking behind someone\u2019s back. My mom\u2019s voice wavered, pulling me back to her pain, while Mark\u2019s messages kept popping up, demanding my attention.\n\nI felt torn\u2014my mom needed my full support, but Mark was waiting for a response, expecting me to join in his criticism. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which role to answer first."}
