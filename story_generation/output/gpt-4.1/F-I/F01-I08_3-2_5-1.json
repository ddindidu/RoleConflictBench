My daughter\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDad, we need you here. It\u2019s important.\u201d My grandson\u2019s anxious eyes met mine from across the room, silently pleading for comfort. I knew my family needed me, especially now, when things felt so uncertain. But just as I was about to stand, I caught sight of Mark, an acquaintance from work, waving me over. He was introducing me to his friend, a newcomer to town, who looked lost and out of place among the laughter and chatter. Mark\u2019s hopeful smile told me he was counting on me to help the newcomer feel welcome, to be the warm, approachable person he\u2019d described. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my family\u2019s crisis and toward the quiet stranger who needed a friendly face. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, unsure which path to take as I stood frozen between them."}
