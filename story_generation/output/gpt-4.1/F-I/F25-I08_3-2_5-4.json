She wanted me to lead the family\u2019s annual remembrance ceremony this year\u2014a role my late father always held. \u201cIt\u2019s important to us,\u201d she\u2019d said, her eyes hopeful. I knew what it meant: to honor tradition, to show I belonged, to prove I respected the family\u2019s values. My stomach twisted with nerves, but I nodded, not wanting to disappoint her or my step-siblings.\n\nThat same afternoon, my phone buzzed. It was Mark, a guy from my book club. \u201cHey, could you help me move some boxes this Saturday? I\u2019m in a bind.\u201d I hesitated. Mark didn\u2019t have many friends in town, and I knew he\u2019d helped others before. I wanted to be there for him, to show I was reliable and supportive.\n\nBut the ceremony was on Saturday. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my stepfamily expecting me to step up, Mark needing a friend. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I wondered how I could possibly choose without letting someone down."}
