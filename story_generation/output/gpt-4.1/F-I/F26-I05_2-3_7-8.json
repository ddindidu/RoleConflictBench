My granddaughter had just started her new job, and the family group chat buzzed with her updates\u2014her excitement was contagious, and I knew she expected me to call, to share in her joy, to be the supportive grandparent who always listened. At the same time, my mentee had sent a desperate email, asking for a last-minute video call. Their project presentation was tomorrow, and they were teetering on the edge of panic, needing guidance and reassurance that only I could provide. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the expectation to nurture family bonds, to be present and attentive, and the responsibility to foster growth, to be the steady hand guiding someone through a pivotal moment. My heart ached as I stared at the clock, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both the attention they deserved at the same time. The phone rang, and I hesitated, torn between answering my granddaughter\u2019s call or opening my laptop for my mentee."}
