As a father, I felt the weight of every dollar\u2014my family depended on me to keep the lights on, to put food on the table. Lately, money had been tight, and I was constantly searching for ways to stretch each paycheck. Just as I was calculating what we could cut back on, I heard my dog barking loudly in the hallway. Through the thin apartment walls, I could hear my neighbor\u2019s frustrated sigh. \n\nAs a neighbor, I knew I was expected to keep the peace, to make sure my dog didn\u2019t disturb others, especially in our shared spaces. But hiring a dog trainer or even a walker to help with his anxiety was another expense I simply couldn\u2019t afford right now. My neighbor had already left a polite note asking if I could do something about the noise. I felt torn\u2014my family needed every cent, but I also didn\u2019t want to be the source of tension in our building. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, and I sat there, unsure which responsibility I could afford to let down."}
