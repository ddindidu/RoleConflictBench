My daughter\u2019s open class was about to start, and I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be there, sitting in the front row, cheering her on. She\u2019d been talking about her presentation for days, her eyes shining with excitement. As I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed. It was my best friend, her voice trembling on the other end. \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now,\u201d she whispered, barely holding back tears. I could hear the pain in her words, the kind that only a friend could help soothe. My heart twisted. I wanted to be there for her, to listen and offer comfort, just as she\u2019d done for me so many times before. But my daughter was waiting, counting on me to show up, to be the mom who never missed a moment. The weight of both promises pressed down on me, and I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between two worlds, not knowing which one needed me more."}
