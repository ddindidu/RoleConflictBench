The first message was from Mom, asking how my day was going and if I\u2019d eaten lunch yet. She always expected me to reply quickly, and I knew she\u2019d worry if I didn\u2019t. The second message was from Alex, my friend, who sounded frustrated: \u201cHey, are we meeting at the caf\u00e9 or the park? I\u2019m confused. Let me know ASAP.\u201d I could almost hear the impatience in his words. I knew from past experience that if I didn\u2019t clear things up right away, Alex would assume I was ignoring him, and the misunderstanding would only get worse. But Mom\u2019s message tugged at me too\u2014she\u2019d be hurt if I left her waiting. My fingers hovered over the screen, torn between reassuring my mom and clarifying things with Alex. The pressure built in my chest as I tried to decide whose expectations to meet first, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
