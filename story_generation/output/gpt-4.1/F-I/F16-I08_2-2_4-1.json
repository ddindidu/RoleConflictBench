But as I stood in the living room, I caught sight of my acquaintance, Sarah, waving me over. She was introducing me to her friend, a quiet woman who looked lost in the crowd, clutching her drink and barely making eye contact. Sarah\u2019s eyes pleaded with me to help break the ice, to be the friendly, welcoming person she\u2019d described. I felt the tug of both worlds\u2014my partner\u2019s trust in me to keep our home running smoothly, and Sarah\u2019s hope that I\u2019d make her friend feel included. My mind raced, torn between slipping away to tackle the laundry and staying to offer warmth to someone who clearly needed it. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood there, heart pounding, caught between the demands of home and the needs of the moment."}
