It was a message from my husband: \u201cCan we talk? I really need you right now.\u201d He\u2019d been struggling with a big decision at work, and I knew he was counting on me to listen, to reassure him, to help him sort through his thoughts. I started typing a reply, promising I\u2019d call as soon as I got home.\n\nJust then, I noticed a woman at the next table, someone I recognized from a few neighborhood gatherings. She was quietly crying, her shoulders shaking. Our eyes met, and she tried to compose herself, but I could see she was hurting. As an acquaintance, I felt I should offer a kind word, maybe sit with her for a moment, show that I cared. But my husband\u2019s message weighed on me\u2014he needed me, too, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down.\n\nI sat there, torn, my heart pulled in two directions. I wanted to be the supportive wife he needed, but I also didn\u2019t want to turn away from someone in pain right in front of me."}
