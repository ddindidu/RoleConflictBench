It means a lot to your brother that you\u2019re there.\u201d I knew how important these gatherings were\u2014my family expected me to be present, to laugh, to help set the table, to be a good sister. Just as I zipped up my suitcase, my phone buzzed. It was Jamie, someone I\u2019d only known for a few months. Her message was frantic: \u201cMy car broke down on the old highway. I\u2019m kind of scared. Can you help?\u201d I stared at the screen, heart pounding. Jamie didn\u2019t have anyone else nearby, and I knew she\u2019d only reach out if she was desperate. I could picture her stranded, anxious, hoping I\u2019d come through. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss the start of the family trip, disappoint everyone, and maybe even ruin the mood. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which role I was supposed to honor."}
