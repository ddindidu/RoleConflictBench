My mom barely smiled, and my dad\u2019s shoulders slumped as he sat at the kitchen table. I knew they\u2019d been dealing with a lot lately, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014I should sit with them, listen, and offer comfort. But my phone buzzed with a message from a group of acquaintances, inviting me to join them at a nearby caf\u00e9. When I arrived, the conversation quickly turned to a mutual colleague\u2019s recent decisions at work. Some people started criticizing her, and others laughed along. I felt uncomfortable, remembering how much I disliked gossip. I wanted to change the subject, but I also didn\u2019t want to seem judgmental or distant. At the same time, my mind kept drifting back to my parents at home, wondering if I should have stayed with them instead. The pressure to be a supportive daughter and a considerate acquaintance pulled me in opposite directions, leaving me tense and uncertain about what to do next."}
