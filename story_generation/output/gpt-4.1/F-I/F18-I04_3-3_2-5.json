She\u2019d just gotten the call about Dad\u2019s diagnosis, and I could feel her pain as if it were my own. I knew she needed me\u2014needed someone to hold her, to listen, to just be there. That\u2019s what we always promised each other: no matter what, we\u2019d be there in the hardest moments.\n\nBut then my phone rang again, this time with a frantic call from my best friend, Sam. His voice shook as he told me his car had broken down on the highway, miles from home, and he was scared. He needed me to come get him right away. I could hear the cars rushing past him, the fear in his voice. He\u2019d always been there for me, and I knew he was counting on me now.\n\nI looked at my sister, her eyes red and pleading, and then at my phone, Sam\u2019s name still glowing on the screen. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once, torn between the people who needed me most."}
