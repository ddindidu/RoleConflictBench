My granddaughter, Emma, slumped beside me, her eyes fixed on the ground. I could sense her sadness, the way her fingers twisted the hem of her sleeve. As her grandmother, I felt the urge to offer her comfort, to share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years, to gently guide her through whatever was troubling her. But before I could speak, a woman I recognized from my book club hurried past, tears streaming down her face. She stopped, noticing me, and I remembered my role as an acquaintance\u2014friendly, supportive, but not intrusive. She needed someone to listen, not advice or probing questions. I glanced at Emma, then at the woman, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in. My heart ached to help them both, but I knew I couldn\u2019t be everything to everyone at once. The park felt suddenly smaller, the air thick with the tension of choosing which role to step into, and which to set aside, if only for a moment."}
