My spouse lingered by the sink, eyes clouded with worry, voice softer than usual. I knew I should close the laptop, look them in the eye, and ask what was wrong\u2014be the partner who listens, who shares, who communicates openly. But my phone buzzed again: my mentee, anxious about the looming deadline for a decision that could change their career. They needed my guidance, my full attention, my structured advice. I could hear the expectation in their messages, the trust they placed in me. My spouse\u2019s sigh pulled me back, guilt twisting in my chest. I wanted to be present for both, to offer comfort and wisdom, but the demands pressed in from both sides. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the person I love and the person who looks up to me, knowing I couldn\u2019t give either what they truly needed in this moment."}
