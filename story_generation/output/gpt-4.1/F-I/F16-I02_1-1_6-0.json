She asked about my day, and I gave her a quick summary\u2014nothing special, just the usual. I could tell she wanted more, maybe a deeper conversation, but I felt tired and distracted. My phone buzzed. It was a message from my girlfriend, who sounded a bit off. She\u2019d had a rough day and needed someone to talk to. I felt the pull immediately: my wife expected me to open up, to share and connect, but my girlfriend needed me to listen and comfort her. I wanted to be present for both, but the demands clashed. If I focused on my wife, I\u2019d leave my girlfriend feeling unsupported. If I turned my attention to my girlfriend, I\u2019d be shutting my wife out. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat there, phone in hand, heart racing, unsure which role to fulfill first."}
