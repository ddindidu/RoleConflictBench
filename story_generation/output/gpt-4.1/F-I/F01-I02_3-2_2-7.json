My grandson, eyes wide and voice trembling, had just asked me for advice about a fight he\u2019d had with his best friend. He wanted to know what I would do, how I\u2019d handled things when I was his age. I could see how much he needed me to be calm, wise, and present\u2014someone who could help him make sense of his feelings.\n\nBut my phone kept vibrating. It was my girlfriend, texting again. We\u2019d argued three times this week about money\u2014how we spent it, how we saved it, how we talked about it. She wanted to talk now, to resolve things before the tension grew any worse. I knew she expected me to be attentive, to listen, to help us find a way forward.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, my heart heavy. My grandson needed my undivided attention, but so did she. I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing on me, each demanding a different part of myself, and I didn\u2019t know how to be what both of them needed at the same time."}
