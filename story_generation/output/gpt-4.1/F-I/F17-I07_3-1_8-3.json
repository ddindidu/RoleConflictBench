My phone buzzed, and I saw a message from my manager, reminding me about the task due next week. There was plenty of time, and I knew my colleagues could move forward without my part for a bit. Still, I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014being reliable at work mattered to me.\n\nJust then, my mom called from the living room. Her voice was softer than usual, and when I joined her, she looked at me with tired eyes. She started talking about how overwhelmed she felt lately, about worries she\u2019d never shared before. I could see she needed me\u2014not just to listen, but to really be there, to offer comfort and support. My mind raced between the open laptop in my room and my mom\u2019s trembling hands. I wanted to be the dependable colleague, but right now, my parents needed me as their child. The weight of both expectations pressed down, and I sat there, torn, unsure which role to answer first."}
