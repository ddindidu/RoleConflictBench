She\u2019d just snapped at her younger brother, and I knew I should address it\u2014remind her about kindness, about respect, about the values I promised myself I\u2019d help instill. But my phone buzzed again. My mentee, desperate for advice, was about to present her project to the board. She needed encouragement, a last-minute pep talk, maybe even a few pointers to help her shine. I could hear the anxiety in her messages, and I knew how much this meant for her future. My stepdaughter\u2019s sulky silence pressed on me, a reminder of my promise to guide her, to be present. But my mentee\u2019s career was on the line, and she was counting on me, too. The weight of both expectations pulled at me, and I felt torn, caught between the needs of the child in front of me and the young professional reaching out for support. My heart raced as I tried to decide where I was needed most, feeling the strain of being both a step-parent and a mentor, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
