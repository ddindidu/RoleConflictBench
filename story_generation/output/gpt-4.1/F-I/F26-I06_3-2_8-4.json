My daughter had just called, her voice trembling as she shared the news about my grandson\u2019s sudden health scare. As a grandmother, I knew I should be there for her, offering comfort, checking in regularly, and making sure the family felt supported. But as I hung up, my laptop chimed\u2014a reminder of the looming project deadline. My mentor had emphasized the importance of transparency, urging me to reach out immediately if I hit any roadblocks. Now, a technical glitch had brought my work to a standstill, and I was expected to communicate this setback without delay. I stared at the phone, torn between calling my daughter back to reassure her and drafting an email to my mentor. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my attention, each expecting me to be present and responsive. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety swirling as I tried to decide who needed me more in this moment."}
