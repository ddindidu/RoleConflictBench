My sister had just sent a reminder: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we need you there for the group photo and to help with the food!\u201d I knew how much these gatherings meant to everyone, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last year. At the same time, my work laptop pinged with a new email. My team was waiting for my input on a project detail before they could move forward. The subject line read, \u201cUrgent: Need your clarification ASAP.\u201d I could almost feel the impatience behind the words. I wanted to be the reliable brother who showed up for family, but I was also expected to be the dependable colleague who never left the team hanging. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment in my sister\u2019s voice against the frustration I\u2019d hear from my manager if I delayed. I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, both needing me at the same moment."}
