I wanted to give him that joy, to keep my word as his father, to show him that I could provide.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from Mia. Another tense text about our arguments this week, all circling back to money. She wanted us to talk, to finally resolve things, to prove I could be a responsible partner and not just spend impulsively. I knew she was waiting for me at her apartment, expecting me to show I cared about our future together.\n\nI stared at the store\u2019s sliding doors, feeling the weight of both their expectations pressing down on me.
