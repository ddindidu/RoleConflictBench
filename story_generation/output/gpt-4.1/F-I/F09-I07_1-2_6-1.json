It\u2019s almost 4:30, and the team meeting starts in fifteen minutes. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cPick up Nintendo for Alex.\u201d I\u2019d promised him, after weeks of saving, that today would be the day. He\u2019s been counting down, his little face lighting up every morning with hope. But the only store that has it in stock closes at five, and it\u2019s a thirty-minute drive. \n\nAt work, my manager\u2019s email is clear: \u201cToday\u2019s meeting is critical. We\u2019ll discuss project changes\u2014no summary will be sent.\u201d I know missing it could mean falling behind, letting my team down, or worse, being seen as unreliable. But if I don\u2019t get the Nintendo, I\u2019ll break my promise to Alex, and I can already imagine his disappointment. \n\nI feel torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. My son\u2019s trust, my team\u2019s expectations\u2014both matter so much. I stare at my computer, paralyzed, as the minutes tick by, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
