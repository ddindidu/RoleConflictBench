My son\u2019s hopeful eyes flashed in my memory\u2014he\u2019d been counting down the days until I could buy him the Nintendo I\u2019d promised. He\u2019d been so patient, and I wanted to keep my word, to see his face light up. But the numbers in my bank account told a different story. Every dollar mattered, and I needed to be careful, to keep us secure.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my mentor, asking for an update on my project. I\u2019d hit a technical wall days ago, but I hadn\u2019t said anything yet. I worried she\u2019d think I wasn\u2019t capable, that I was falling behind. I knew I should reach out, admit I was stuck, but I hesitated. I didn\u2019t want to seem weak or distracted, especially when I was already stretched thin.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my son\u2019s trust, my mentor\u2019s expectations. I stared at the screen, torn between the needs of my family and the demands of my career, unsure which voice to answer first."}
