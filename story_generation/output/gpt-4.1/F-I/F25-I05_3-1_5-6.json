It\u2019s important for the family.\u201d I knew what she meant\u2014my father\u2019s side had always been proud of their traditions, and as the step-child, I was expected to show my loyalty by upholding them. But the thought of standing in front of everyone, reciting words that still felt foreign, made my stomach twist.\n\nMy phone buzzed. A message from Jamie, my mentee at work: \u201cSorry, I\u2019m behind on the project again. Can we talk?\u201d Jamie had been struggling, and as a mentor, I was supposed to help her grow, encourage her to find her own path, even if it meant challenging the status quo or stepping back from obligations.\n\nI stared at the family ceremony script in one hand and Jamie\u2019s message in the other. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014one demanding I honor the past, the other urging me to nurture the future. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
