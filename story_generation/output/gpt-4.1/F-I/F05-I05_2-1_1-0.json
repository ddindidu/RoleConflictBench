She\u2019d just been offered a promotion, but it meant relocating\u2014leaving behind friends, family, and the life we\u2019d built. She looked at me, searching for reassurance, craving the kind of unwavering support a husband should give. I could feel her need for comfort, for me to say, \u201cWhatever you choose, I\u2019m with you.\u201d\n\nBut as she spoke, my mind slipped into mentor mode. I\u2019d always been the go-to person at work for career advice, offering practical, detached guidance to colleagues facing crossroads. I felt the urge to analyze her options, to lay out pros and cons, to treat her dilemma like any other professional\u2019s. Yet, I knew she didn\u2019t want a mentor\u2014she wanted her husband.\n\nThe expectations tugged at me from both sides. Should I be the supportive partner, or the objective advisor? My heart ached as I realized I couldn\u2019t be both at once. I took a breath, feeling the weight of her gaze, and tried to decide which role she needed most from me right now."}
