He barely looked up as I set down my bag. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said, voice trembling. He needed me\u2014needed my reassurance, my advice, my arms around him. I sat beside him, listening as he poured out his fears about a risky project at work. I wanted to give him my full attention, to be the supportive wife he counted on.\n\nBut just then, my phone buzzed. A message from the building group chat: \u201cNoise complaint meeting in the lobby now.\u201d I remembered the tension in the hallway, the whispered complaints about late-night music. As a neighbor, I was expected to show up, be polite, and help smooth things over. I glanced at my husband, then at the clock. If I left, I\u2019d be abandoning him in his moment of need. If I stayed, I\u2019d risk seeming rude and uncooperative to the neighbors I see every day. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, torn between the person who needed me most and the community that expected my presence."}
