She\u2019d barely eaten dinner, and I knew she needed someone to talk to, someone to remind her she was more than a grade. As her sibling, I felt the pull to sit with her, to listen and reassure her that she\u2019d be okay no matter what happened. But just as I was about to knock on her door, I glanced out the window and saw our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, struggling to fit her overflowing trash bag into her own bin. Our shared bins were only half-full, and I knew she\u2019d appreciate the extra space if I took ours out early. As a neighbor, I was expected to be considerate, to help keep our shared spaces tidy and accessible. I stood in the hallway, torn between comforting my sister and helping Mrs. Lee. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt my chest tighten as I tried to decide which role to fulfill first."}
