My spouse sat across from me, eyes searching mine, waiting for my response to a question about our finances. We\u2019d agreed to be completely open with each other, especially about big decisions like this. I could feel the weight of that expectation\u2014honesty, transparency, no distractions. But my phone vibrated again, a reminder of my other world. I glanced at the screen and saw a message from a colleague. It was just an update, nothing urgent, but I knew our team valued quick responses, even for routine matters. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, reminding us to stay connected and responsive. My spouse\u2019s voice pulled me back, gentle but firm, asking if I was really listening. I felt torn, the pressure building inside me. I wanted to give my full attention to this important conversation, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my team down. My thumb hovered over my phone, my mind racing, caught between the need to be present at home and the expectation to stay engaged at work."}
