I wanted to honor the family, to show I belonged, but my mind kept drifting to the conversation I\u2019d had earlier with an acquaintance from school. She had confided in me about a mistake someone in our family had made years ago\u2014a secret that, if revealed, could cast a shadow over the ceremony and the person\u2019s reputation. My acquaintance trusted me not to gossip, to keep her confidence.

My heart pounded, caught between the desire to belong and the fear of betraying someone\u2019s trust."}
