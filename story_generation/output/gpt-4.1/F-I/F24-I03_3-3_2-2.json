I really need you.\u201d He\u2019d just found out his dad\u2014my stepdad\u2014was seriously ill, and I knew he was falling apart. I was supposed to be there for him, the one person he could lean on when things got rough. But as I stared at his message, my phone vibrated again. This time, it was my boyfriend. \u201cI can\u2019t stop crying. Can you come over?\u201d His grandmother had passed away that morning, and he was shattered. I could hear the pain in his voice, and I knew he needed me, too. My chest tightened as I looked between the two messages.
