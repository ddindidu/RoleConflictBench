I can spare an hour before my flight.\u201d My heart thudded. Tonight was the annual family dinner\u2014my grandmother\u2019s favorite tradition, where everyone gathered, shared stories, and honored our roots. My parents had reminded me all week how important it was to be there, to show respect for our family\u2019s values. But my mentor, who had guided me through so much, was squeezing me in at the last possible moment. I knew how rare this opportunity was, how much I owed it to her to be present and focused. My mind raced with guilt and anxiety. If I left the dinner early, I\u2019d disappoint my family and break a promise. If I skipped the session, I\u2019d let down my mentor and maybe miss out on something important. I sat at the edge of my bed, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
