She\u2019d barely slept in days, and I knew she needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my undivided attention. I was determined to be present, to reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone in this storm. Just as I reached for her shoulder, my phone buzzed. It was my best friend, Sam. The message was short: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d I could hear the strain in his voice when I answered. He\u2019d just had a huge fight with his partner and was on the verge of tears. He needed me to listen, to be the friend who always made time, who never let him down. My wife\u2019s eyes searched mine, silently pleading for comfort. Sam\u2019s voice cracked through the phone, desperate for support. My heart twisted, torn between the two people who counted on me most, both expecting me to be their anchor at the very same moment. I felt the weight of their needs pressing in, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
