My grandson had fallen ill suddenly, and she needed me to come over right away. As a grandmother, I felt a deep pull to be there, to comfort him and support my family. The thought of his small hand in mine, his feverish forehead, made my heart ache. But then I glanced at the spreadsheet open on my screen. My team was counting on me to finish my part of the project. The deadline wasn\u2019t pressing, and I knew the others could continue without my section for a bit, but I also knew how much we all valued reliability. I prided myself on never letting my colleagues down. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my family\u2019s urgent need for my presence, and my commitment to my team. I felt torn, my mind racing with guilt and worry, unable to silence the voices of expectation from both sides."}
