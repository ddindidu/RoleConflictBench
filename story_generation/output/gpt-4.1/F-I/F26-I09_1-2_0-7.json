She was anxious about starting her first job, asking for advice on how to make a good impression and handle the nerves. I could almost hear her voice, hopeful and uncertain, and I wanted to give her all the reassurance and wisdom I could muster. Just as I started typing a thoughtful reply, thunder rumbled outside and I remembered the storm advisory. Mrs. Patel, my neighbor, lived alone down the hall. She always relied on me to check in during bad weather, and I knew she\u2019d be uneasy tonight. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my granddaughter needed my attention and guidance, but Mrs. Patel might need my presence and help if the storm worsened. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between the family who looked to me for wisdom and the neighbor who counted on my support. I stared at my phone, uncertain which need to answer first, feeling the storm both outside and within."}
