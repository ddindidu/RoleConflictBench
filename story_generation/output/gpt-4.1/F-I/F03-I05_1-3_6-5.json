Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I knew what she wanted\u2014someone to listen, to reassure her, to ask if everything was okay at home. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check in more often, to be the son they needed, especially now that they seemed more fragile. But just as I was about to call, my phone buzzed again. This time, it was from Maya, the intern I was mentoring. She was about to submit her first major report, and she sounded anxious: \u201cCan you review this with me? I\u2019m worried I missed something important.\u201d I could hear the urgency in her voice; a mistake could cost the team dearly. My parents needed me to be present, to care. Maya needed me to be sharp, focused, and thorough. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect. My heart raced as I tried to decide who needed me more in this moment."}
