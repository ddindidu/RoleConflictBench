I could see the worry lines on their face, the way their shoulders slumped. I knew I should ask, should open the door for them to share what was weighing them down. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014honesty, openness, no matter how tired or distracted we were. But my phone buzzed again: another message from my mentee, desperate for advice on their project. They were floundering, and I\u2019d promised to be there, to guide them through every step. I felt the pull in both directions\u2014my spouse needing my attention, my mentee needing my guidance. My heart ached with the pressure, the fear of letting one down if I chose the other. I looked from my spouse\u2019s anxious eyes to the glowing screen, torn between the two worlds that needed me, unsure which voice to answer first."}
