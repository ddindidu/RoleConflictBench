I knew how much it meant to them, especially after everything they\u2019d been through. As I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed with a message from Mark, an old acquaintance from work. \u201cHey, I\u2019m in your neighborhood for a meeting. Any chance you could recommend a good place for lunch? I\u2019m totally lost here.\u201d\n\nI hesitated, thumb hovering over the screen. Mark had always been friendly, and I remembered how he\u2019d helped me out when I was new at the office. He probably expected a quick reply, maybe even a call to talk through options. But if I stopped to help him now, I\u2019d risk being late for the kids. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014being the reliable step-parent they could count on, and the helpful acquaintance who didn\u2019t let people down. I stood in the hallway, torn, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
