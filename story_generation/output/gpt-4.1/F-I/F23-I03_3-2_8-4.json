The home loan repayment is looming, and I know I need to sit down tonight and go over the finances, maybe even call the bank to discuss options. As a step-parent, I feel the weight of making sure everyone under this roof is secure, that nothing slips through the cracks. But then my phone buzzes\u2014a message from Mia, my girlfriend. She\u2019s excited for our dinner tonight, the only evening we have together before she leaves for her work trip. She\u2019s been looking forward to this all week, and honestly, so have I. I want to be present, to laugh and talk and make her feel special. But the numbers keep swirling in my head, and I can\u2019t shake the anxiety about the loan. I feel torn, pulled between the responsibility to my family and the desire to nurture my relationship. My chest tightens as I try to figure out how to be both the reliable step-parent and the loving girlfriend, knowing that tonight, I can\u2019t fully be both."}
