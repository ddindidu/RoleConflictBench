He looked so defeated, and I could feel his need for reassurance and support. I wanted to be fully present for him, to listen and hold him, but my phone buzzed with a message from my mom: \u201cHaven\u2019t heard from you this weekend. Everything okay?\u201d I knew my parents worried if I didn\u2019t check in, and I could already imagine my mom\u2019s anxious voice if I didn\u2019t reply soon.
