The next big payment was looming in two months, and I felt the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest. As a parent, I knew I had to make sure we didn\u2019t miss a payment\u2014my family\u2019s security depended on it. I\u2019d been thinking about picking up some extra freelance work to pad our savings, but that would mean working late nights and weekends.\n\nAt the same time, my inbox pinged with a reminder from my team lead about the project I was supposed to finish. The deadline was still a few weeks away, and honestly, the others could keep moving without my part for now. But as a colleague, I didn\u2019t want to let the team down or be seen as unreliable. I could feel the tension building inside me\u2014should I focus on the extra work to ensure my family\u2019s financial stability, or should I stick to my usual hours and finish my tasks early for the team? The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I sat there, torn, unable to decide which role to prioritize."}
