My mom looked at me, expecting me to chime in about the family hike she\u2019d been planning for weeks. I knew how much it meant to her that we all spent time together, especially since I\u2019d been so busy lately. But as I reached for my phone, I saw a message from Mia: \u201cRough day. Can we talk later?\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words. She\u2019d been under a lot of pressure at work, and I knew she needed me to be there for her, to listen and reassure her. My family\u2019s laughter pulled me back, and my sister nudged me, asking if I was in for the hike. I felt torn\u2014my family wanted me present, engaged, part of their plans, but Mia needed me too, in a different way. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat there, caught between the people I loved, unsure how to be the brother and boyfriend they each needed right now."}
