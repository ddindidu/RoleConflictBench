Her text was desperate: \u201cCan you come over? I really need you.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. I knew she was struggling after her breakup, and being there for each other was what we always promised. But as I glanced at my laptop, the unfinished report glared back at me. The deadline was tonight, and my part was crucial for the team. If I didn\u2019t finish, the next person couldn\u2019t start, and the whole project would be delayed. I could already imagine the disappointment in my manager\u2019s voice and the frustration of my teammates. My heart twisted, torn between the sister who needed me and the colleague everyone was counting on. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down, each demanding more than I could give. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, paralyzed, as I tried to decide which promise I would have to break."}
