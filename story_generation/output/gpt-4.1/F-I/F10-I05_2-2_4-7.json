It\u2019s our tradition.\u201d The weight of her expectation pressed on me, a reminder of how much my family values these customs, especially now, when they feel our ties loosening. As a daughter, I know how much it means to them that I show up, participate, and honor our heritage.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from Priya, my mentee. She\u2019s on the verge of a major promotion, and the final interview is scheduled for the same weekend. She\u2019s nervous, asking if I can help her prepare, maybe even run a mock interview. As her mentor, I\u2019ve always encouraged her to seize every opportunity, to push past boundaries\u2014something I wish I\u2019d done more of at her age.\n\nI feel torn, the expectations of my family and my mentee pulling me in opposite directions. My heart aches with the fear of disappointing someone, and I wonder how I can possibly be the daughter my family wants and the mentor Priya needs, all at once."}
