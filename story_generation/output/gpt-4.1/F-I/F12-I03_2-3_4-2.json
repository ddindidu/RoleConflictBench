As a wife, I knew the family depended on me to keep things running smoothly\u2014clean clothes for tomorrow\u2019s school trip, my husband\u2019s work shirts, the kids\u2019 uniforms. But my phone buzzed again, a message from him\u2014my boyfriend\u2014his words raw and broken. He\u2019d just lost his father, and he needed me, not just as a friend, but as someone who could hold his pain, listen, and be present. My heart twisted. I wanted to be there for him, to offer comfort and warmth, but the pile of responsibilities at home loomed large. If I left now, the laundry wouldn\u2019t get done, and my family would feel the impact. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting him down when he needed me most. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I stood frozen, torn between the demands of being a good wife and the pull to be a supportive girlfriend."}
