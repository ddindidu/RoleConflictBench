He grinned at me, excitement radiating from him as he prepared to try a trick he\u2019d only watched online. My heart pounded with worry\u2014I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder from my mentor to check in if I had any questions. I did have a small one, something about terminology in the project I was working on, but it wasn\u2019t urgent. Still, I knew my mentor expected me to communicate openly, not let things pile up. I glanced between my brother, who was already rolling toward the ramp, and my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. Should I run to stop him, or quickly send my question before I forgot? The pressure of being a good sibling and a responsible mentee twisted inside me, and I felt frozen, torn between two worlds that suddenly seemed impossible to balance."}
