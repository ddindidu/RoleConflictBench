She smiled at me, clearly happy I was finally joining in, and my dad gave me a thumbs-up from across the room. I knew how much it meant to them that I was here, trying to be part of this new family. Just as I started folding napkins, my phone buzzed. It was Sam, my best friend, panicked and nearly in tears. She was already on her way to the airport for her grandmother\u2019s funeral and thought she\u2019d left her passport at home. \u201cCan you check my room and bring it if it\u2019s there? Please, I\u2019ll miss my flight otherwise.\u201d My heart pounded. I could see the hope in my stepmom\u2019s eyes, the way she wanted me to belong. But Sam needed me\u2014she\u2019d do the same for me in a heartbeat. I stared at my phone, torn between the family I was trying to build and the friend who\u2019d always been there."}
