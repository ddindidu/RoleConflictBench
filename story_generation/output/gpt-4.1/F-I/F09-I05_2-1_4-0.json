She wanted quick advice about whether to accept a summer internship\u2014something I\u2019d usually answer with thoughtful guidance. But at that moment, my son darted away from me, weaving between displays, giggling as he knocked a box of cereal to the floor. I felt the eyes of other shoppers on me, expecting me to step in, to teach him about respect and discipline. My phone buzzed again\u2014Sarah, waiting for my response, trusting me to help her make a decision that could shape her future. I gripped the cart, torn between the immediate need to correct my son\u2019s behavior and the responsibility I felt toward Sarah. Both roles demanded my full attention, both expecting me to guide, to teach, to be present. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between the cereal aisle and my phone, knowing I couldn\u2019t give either the care they deserved at that moment."}
