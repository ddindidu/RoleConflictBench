Tomorrow was the open class at Lily\u2019s school, the one she\u2019d been talking about for weeks. She wanted me there, sitting in the front row, cheering her on as she read her story aloud. I could already picture her searching the crowd for my face, hoping I\u2019d be there like a real parent. But tomorrow night was also the only evening Mark and I had together before he left for his week-long business trip. He\u2019d planned a special dinner, just the two of us, promising we\u2019d finally have time to reconnect. I could hear his voice in my head, \u201cI miss us.\u201d I felt pulled in two directions\u2014Lily\u2019s hopeful eyes, Mark\u2019s gentle smile. Both needed me, both expected me to show up. My chest tightened as I tried to imagine disappointing either of them. I wanted to be the supportive step-parent Lily deserved, and the loving girlfriend Mark needed. But I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart pounded as I realized I had to choose, and I wasn\u2019t sure who I\u2019d let down more."}
