He asked about my day, and I hesitated, remembering the lunch I\u2019d had with someone I cared about deeply\u2014someone who wasn\u2019t him. I wanted to be honest, to communicate openly as a good wife should, but the words caught in my throat. Later, my phone buzzed with a message from my boyfriend. He sounded off, his texts clipped and short. I knew he\u2019d had a rough day at work, and as his girlfriend, I wanted to be there for him, to offer comfort and support. But as I typed out a reassuring reply, guilt gnawed at me. How could I be emotionally present for him while hiding so much from my husband? The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014honesty at home, empathy elsewhere. My heart raced as I tried to balance the demands, feeling the weight of secrets and the ache of wanting to do right by both. I stared at my phone, torn, unsure which role to fulfill first."}
