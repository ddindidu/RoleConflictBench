My stepbrother, Alex, texted, \u201cCan you talk? I\u2019m freaking out about tomorrow\u2019s exam.\u201d I could almost hear the panic in his words. He\u2019d always been there for me, especially after our parents married, and I knew he needed me now. But just as I started to reply, my mentor\u2019s reminder popped up: \u201cReady for our session? I have an hour before my flight.\u201d She\u2019d squeezed me into her packed schedule, and I\u2019d promised to be prepared and focused. I stared at the screen, heart pounding. Alex needed comfort, but my mentor expected my full attention and respect for her time. I felt torn, guilt pressing on both sides. If I ignored Alex, I\u2019d let him down when he was most vulnerable. If I postponed the session, I\u2019d waste my mentor\u2019s rare availability. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which role I owed more in this moment, feeling the weight of both expectations pulling me apart."}
