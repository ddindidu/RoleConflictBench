I knew how much it meant to her that I\u2019d be there, sitting among the other parents, showing her I cared. As I rounded the corner, I spotted Mark, an old acquaintance from my previous job, walking toward me. The hallway was nearly empty, and I could feel his eyes catch mine. I remembered how he always expected a warm greeting, a bit of small talk, and a smile\u2014he\u2019d once told me it made his day when people acknowledged him.\n\nBut I was already running late, and my mind was racing with thoughts of my stepdaughter\u2019s hopeful face scanning the room for me. If I stopped to chat, I\u2019d risk missing the start of her presentation, letting her down when she needed me most. If I rushed past Mark without a word, I\u2019d seem cold and unfriendly, maybe even hurt his feelings. My heart pounded as I slowed my steps, torn between the expectations of being a supportive step-parent and a considerate acquaintance, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
