I felt the familiar tug to offer her the wisdom she sought, to share stories of my own first apartment, the mistakes I made, the lessons I learned. I wanted to give her the confidence to take that leap, to reassure her that she\u2019d find her way.\n\nBut just as I opened my mouth, I noticed Mrs. Patel from next door dragging her trash bin to the curb. I remembered the unspoken agreement on our street: only put the bins out when they\u2019re full, to keep the sidewalk clear and tidy. Ours was only half-full, but if I waited, it might overflow before the next pickup. If I put it out now, I\u2019d be disregarding the neighborly understanding, risking Mrs. Patel\u2019s disapproval.\n\nI felt torn, my granddaughter\u2019s expectant gaze on one side, the weight of neighborly respect on the other. My mind raced, caught between the urge to be the wise grandfather and the considerate neighbor, unsure which role to honor first."}
