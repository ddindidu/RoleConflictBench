He\u2019d barely slept in days, and I knew he needed me\u2014my words, my touch, my presence. I stroked his arm, whispering that I was here, that we\u2019d get through this together. My phone buzzed on the coffee table. I glanced at the screen: it was my best friend, Sarah. I hesitated, but answered quietly. Her voice was shaky, on the verge of tears. \u201cCan you talk? I just had a huge fight with Mark. I really need you right now.\u201d I looked at my husband, his eyes pleading for me not to leave his side, even for a moment. My heart twisted. Sarah had always been there for me, and I knew she was counting on me to listen, to help her sort through her pain. But my husband\u2019s grip tightened, silently begging me to stay. I felt torn in two, the weight of both their needs pressing down on me, unsure how to be the support they each so desperately needed at the same time."}
