Can\u2019t wait to celebrate my promotion with you!\u201d I smiled, feeling proud of her, but my heart sank as I glanced at the clock\u20146:15 p.m. Just then, my mentor called. \u201cI have an hour before my flight, can we do our session now?\u201d she asked. I knew how rare it was for her to squeeze me in, especially before a long trip. I felt the weight of her expectation: to be present, prepared, and respectful of her precious time. But my sister had always counted on me to be there for her big moments, and I\u2019d promised I wouldn\u2019t miss this one. My mind raced, torn between the loyalty I owed my sister and the gratitude and respect I felt for my mentor. I could already picture my sister\u2019s disappointed face if I was late, and I could hear my mentor\u2019s voice, patient but firm, if I canceled. My chest tightened as I stared at my phone, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I\u2019d have to let down."}
