She looked up and smiled, but I could tell something was off. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d she said, her voice light but her eyes tired. I knew she wanted me to sit with her, listen, maybe just be there so she could unwind. I wanted to be that person for her, to show her she could lean on me.\n\nJust as I was about to sit down, my phone buzzed. It was Mark, an acquaintance from my old job. \u201cHey, sorry for the last-minute ask, but could you help me move some boxes tonight? I\u2019m really in a bind.\u201d I remembered how he\u2019d helped me out once before, and I knew he didn\u2019t have many people to call on. I felt the weight of his request, the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d step up, just as he had for me.\n\nI stood there, phone in hand, torn between the comfort of my wife and the call for help from someone who needed me. My heart pulled in two directions, each role demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
