My spouse had asked me earlier to make sure everyone had clean clothes for tomorrow\u2019s activities, and I promised I\u2019d handle it. Just as I was sorting socks, my phone buzzed. It was a message from an acquaintance, inviting me to join a group chat. I joined, thinking it would be a quick break, but soon the conversation turned. Someone made a snide remark about a colleague\u2019s recent project, and the others chimed in, laughing and adding their own criticisms. I felt the expectation to join in, to be part of the group, but I remembered how much I disliked gossip and how I always tried to avoid speaking negatively about others. Meanwhile, the laundry sat unfinished, and I could hear my spouse in the kitchen, probably wondering if I\u2019d forgotten my promise. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014should I step away from the chat and finish the laundry, or should I stay and risk being drawn into the gossip, just to maintain my connection with the group? My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between these two worlds."}
