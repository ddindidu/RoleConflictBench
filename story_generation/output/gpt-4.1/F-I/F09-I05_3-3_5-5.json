My son stood by the manager\u2019s office, eyes red, clutching a half-eaten chocolate bar he hadn\u2019t paid for. As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences. I wanted to hold him, to comfort him, but I also needed to be firm, to guide him toward honesty and responsibility.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again\u2014my mentee, desperate for last-minute advice before presenting a project that could make or break her career. She was waiting for my call, counting on my experience to help her avoid a costly mistake. I could hear the anxiety in her earlier messages, the trust she placed in me as her mentor.\n\nStanding there, torn between my son\u2019s trembling hands and my mentee\u2019s urgent need, I felt the weight of both roles pressing down. My heart ached with the impossible choice: to be the mother my child needed in this moment, or the mentor my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 depended on. I closed my eyes, caught in the storm of conflicting expectations, unsure which path to take."}
