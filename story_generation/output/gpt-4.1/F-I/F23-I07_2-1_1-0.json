My stepson, Ethan, had been talking about his open class for weeks, his eyes lighting up every time he mentioned showing me his science project. As his step-parent, I knew how much it meant to him that I be there, especially since his mom couldn\u2019t make it this time. But at work, our team meeting was scheduled for the same afternoon. My manager always emphasized the importance of everyone\u2019s presence, even though the meeting would be recorded. I could already imagine the subtle disappointment in my colleagues\u2019 faces if I skipped out, the unspoken expectation that I should be a team player. My heart twisted as I weighed Ethan\u2019s hopeful anticipation against my responsibility to my team. I felt torn, the pressure from both sides building as the clock ticked closer to the decision point."}
