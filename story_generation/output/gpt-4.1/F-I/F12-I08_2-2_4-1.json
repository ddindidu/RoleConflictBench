My husband had mentioned this morning that he needed his favorite shirt clean for tomorrow\u2019s meeting, and the kids\u2019 uniforms were buried somewhere in the heap. I knew I should get started, but as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Lisa, an acquaintance from work, reminding me about the small get-together at her place tonight. She mentioned a new colleague would be there\u2014someone shy, who didn\u2019t know anyone yet. Lisa hoped I could help make her feel welcome.\n\nI felt the weight of both expectations pressing in. As a wife, I wanted to keep our home running smoothly, to share the load and make sure everyone had what they needed. But as an acquaintance, I was expected to be warm and open, to help someone else feel comfortable in a new environment. My mind raced, torn between the laundry that couldn\u2019t wait and the social obligation that felt equally important. I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, wrestling with the impossible choice between home and hospitality."}
