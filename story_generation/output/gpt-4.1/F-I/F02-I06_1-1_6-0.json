I\u2019d promised him, after all, and he\u2019d been counting down the days. But as I glanced at my phone, a message from my mentor blinked on the screen, reminding me of the optional reading she\u2019d suggested. She\u2019d said it wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew she expected me to go above and beyond, to show initiative and commitment. \n\nMoney was tight this month, and buying the Nintendo would mean dipping into our savings. But I wanted to keep my word to my son, to see his face light up. At the same time, I felt the weight of my mentor\u2019s expectations\u2014if I didn\u2019t keep up, would she think I wasn\u2019t serious about my growth? My mind spun with numbers, time, and the fear of letting someone down. I stared at the unopened reading on my laptop and the Nintendo ad on my browser, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, unsure which promise I should keep first."}
