I saw my friend\u2019s name flash on the screen, and when I answered, I could hear her sobbing. She could barely get the words out\u2014her family had just gotten terrible news, and she needed someone to talk to. I sat up in bed, heart pounding, trying to listen and comfort her, knowing how much she relied on me in moments like this. But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered that tomorrow was Sunday\u2014my stepmom always expected our weekly call in the morning. She\u2019d been clear about how much those calls meant to her, especially since I\u2019d moved out. I could already hear her voice, gentle but disappointed, if I sounded tired or distracted. My friend\u2019s pain pulled at me, but so did the weight of my stepmom\u2019s expectations. I felt torn, caught between being the supportive friend I wanted to be and the caring step-child I was supposed to be. The pressure built inside me as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be both at once."}
