He looked up at me, eyes wide, and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. I sighed, knowing I needed to be consistent, to teach him the right way, even when I was tired.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a message from my mentor: \u201cLet me know if you have any questions.\u201d I did have a question\u2014just a small one about a term in the project brief. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew she expected me to communicate openly, to show initiative. I glanced at my son, who was now poking at his cereal, and felt the weight of both roles pressing in.
