He\u2019d already mentioned he needed his shirt for an early meeting, and I promised I\u2019d handle it. But as I reached for the laundry basket, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the client report was due by midnight. My part was the last piece, and the whole team was waiting on me. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me how important this delivery was for our reputation. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations\u2014my husband counting on me at home, my colleagues depending on me at work. I felt pulled in two directions, guilt and anxiety swirling as I tried to decide which responsibility to put first."}
