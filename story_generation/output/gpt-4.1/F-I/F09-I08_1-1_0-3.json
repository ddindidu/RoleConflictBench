It was a small thing, but it mattered to them, and to me. As I gathered my keys, a message popped up from Linda, an acquaintance from the neighborhood. \u201cHey! Sorry for the last-minute ask, but do you know any good restaurants nearby? My parents are visiting, and I want to take them somewhere nice tonight. Can you help?\u201d\n\nI hesitated, thumb hovering over the screen. Linda had always been kind, and I knew she didn\u2019t have many friends in town. She probably needed a quick answer, maybe even a bit of a chat to help her decide. But if I started texting back now, I might lose track of time, or worse, be late picking up my kids. I could feel the pressure building\u2014my children\u2019s expectant faces on one side, Linda\u2019s hopeful request on the other. My mind raced, torn between being the reliable mother and the supportive acquaintance, unsure which demand to answer first."}
