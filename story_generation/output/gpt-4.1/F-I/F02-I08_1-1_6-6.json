He\u2019d been so excited, counting down the days since I promised him. But the price tag gnawed at me\u2014money was tight this month, and I knew I should be saving for bills. The weight of being a good father pressed on me, the expectation to keep my word and make my child happy, but also to keep our finances stable.\n\nMy phone buzzed. A group chat with some acquaintances lit up, the conversation turning to a mutual colleague\u2019s recent decisions at work. I could see the comments getting sharper, bordering on gossip. I felt the unspoken pressure to join in, to fit in with the group, but I remembered my own values\u2014never speak ill of others, especially behind their backs.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, my mind racing. On one side, the promise to my son and the need to be a responsible provider. On the other, the urge to belong with my peers without betraying my principles. My heart pounded as I hovered over the \u201cbuy\u201d button and the blinking cursor in the chat, caught between what was expected of me and what I expected of myself."}
