My son\u2019s hopeful eyes flashed in my mind\u2014he\u2019d been counting down the days to the Nintendo I\u2019d promised him. I wanted to keep my word, to see his face light up, but the cost would mean tightening our budget even more. Just as I was weighing the expense, my phone buzzed. It was Mrs. Lee from next door, asking if I could receive a package for her. She\u2019s missed deliveries before, and I know how much she relies on me for these small favors, especially since her husband\u2019s been away. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my son\u2019s happiness on one side, my neighbor\u2019s trust on the other. Both expected something from me, and both seemed urgent in their own way. My mind raced, torn between being the reliable father and the dependable neighbor, wondering how I could possibly meet both expectations without letting someone down."}
