She hesitated, then asked, \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you about something important?\u201d Her voice trembled, and I could see she needed more than just a quick answer\u2014she needed the kind of wisdom only years could provide. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from a young colleague I mentor at work, asking for advice about a minor project decision. I\u2019d always prided myself on being approachable, offering light guidance when asked, never overstepping. But Emma\u2019s eyes pleaded for deep understanding, for the kind of support that could shape her future. I felt torn\u2014should I give Emma the full weight of my experience, risking being too directive, or keep my distance as I do with my mentees? The expectations of being a wise, involved grandparent clashed with my careful, hands-off mentoring style. My heart ached as I realized I couldn\u2019t be both at once, and I sat there, caught between the roles, unsure which part of myself to offer."}
