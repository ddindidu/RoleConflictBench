As my step-sibling, I knew Jamie needed comfort\u2014her hands trembled as she stared at the looming final exam schedule. She looked at me, eyes wide and vulnerable, and I felt the familiar tug to reassure her, to say it would all be okay, no matter what. But as her mentor, I also knew I couldn\u2019t sugarcoat things. The task she was preparing for was critical; a single mistake could set her back months. She needed my honest, sometimes harsh, guidance.
