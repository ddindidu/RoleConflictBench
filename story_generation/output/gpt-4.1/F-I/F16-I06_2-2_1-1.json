My mentor\u2019s message echoed in my mind: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing your code sample\u2014don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s due before our next meeting.\u201d I knew how important it was to show initiative and reliability, especially since I\u2019d asked for extra guidance last week. But across the room, my partner paced, phone in hand, eyes clouded with worry. They\u2019d just been offered a promotion, but it meant relocating, and they needed my support\u2014my honest thoughts, my encouragement, my presence.\n\nI wanted to be there, to listen and help them sort through their fears and hopes. But the code wouldn\u2019t write itself, and I could already imagine my mentor\u2019s disappointment if I showed up unprepared. My partner\u2019s voice trembled as they asked, \u201cCan we talk?\u201d I felt torn, guilt rising in my chest. I wanted to be the supportive spouse they needed, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my mentor\u2014or myself\u2014down. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I tried to figure out how to be everything to everyone at once."}
