Our argument from last night still hung in the air, unresolved, and now she was questioning if we should even stay together. My chest tightened with the weight of her words, knowing she expected me to step up, to fix things, to be the steady hand that could calm the storm. Just then, my grandson wandered in, his eyes wide and uncertain. He asked me how to handle the changes he was facing at school, looking for the kind of wisdom only a grandparent could give. I could see he needed my full attention, my patience, and my stories. But my mind kept drifting back to my phone, to the urgent need to respond, to not let my relationship slip away. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by people I loved, each expecting me to be their anchor. My heart ached as I tried to decide where to turn first, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
