My mother had just asked me to lead the ritual this year, saying it was time I took on more responsibility and showed respect for our traditions. I knew how much this meant to her, to everyone\u2014being the eldest, I was expected to set an example, to honor our family\u2019s values. But as I rehearsed the words I\u2019d have to say, my phone buzzed with a message from my best friend. She\u2019d seen my careless comment in the group chat, and her reply was short, cold. My stomach twisted with guilt. I knew I\u2019d hurt her, and I needed to call her right away, to explain, to apologize before things got worse. But downstairs, my family was waiting, expecting me to step up, to be present, to lead. I stared at my phone, torn between the weight of my family\u2019s expectations and the urgent need to fix things with my friend, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
