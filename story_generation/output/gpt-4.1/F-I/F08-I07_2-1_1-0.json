My team expected me to join, to share updates and ideas, even though the meeting would be recorded. But across the room, my granddaughter slumped on the couch, her eyes red and distant.

My colleagues counted on my participation, but my heart ached to sit beside her, to listen and offer comfort. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I fulfill my duty as a reliable colleague, or be the wise, caring grandmother she needed right now?
