The school\u2019s open class for Mia was tomorrow evening\u2014the one she\u2019d been talking about for weeks, hoping I\u2019d be there to see her read her poem. At the same time, it was the only night this week that Emily and I could spend together before she left for her business trip. She\u2019d already mentioned how much she was looking forward to a quiet dinner, just the two of us, after so many hectic days.\n\nI could feel the pressure building in my chest. Mia\u2019s hopeful eyes flashed in my mind, her voice asking, \u201cWill you come this time?\u201d But then I thought of Emily, who\u2019d been patient with my new responsibilities, who needed me to show her she was still a priority. Both needed me, both deserved my attention, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart ached as I weighed their expectations, torn between being the supportive step-parent Mia needed and the loving boyfriend Emily deserved. I sat on the edge of the bed, phone in hand, paralyzed by the choice I had to make."}
