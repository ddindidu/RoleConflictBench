My mom looked at me, her eyes hopeful, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right? We haven\u2019t all spent time together in ages.\u201d I smiled, but my phone buzzed in my lap. It was a long message from Alex, my boyfriend. The argument we\u2019d had earlier was still raw, and now he was saying he didn\u2019t know if we could keep going unless we talked things through tonight. My heart pounded. My family expected me to be present, to laugh and plan and show I cared. But Alex needed me to be his partner, to help fix what was breaking between us. I felt split in two, guilt pressing on both sides. I wanted to be the sister who showed up, but I also wanted to be the girlfriend who didn\u2019t give up. My family\u2019s voices faded as I stared at my phone, torn between the two worlds that both needed me right now."}
