I knew they were carrying more than they let on, and I felt the familiar urge to be there for them, to listen, to offer comfort, to be the child who could somehow lighten their load. But my phone buzzed with a message from my mentee, asking if we could talk. She\u2019d been missing deadlines, her confidence slipping, and I\u2019d promised to help her find her footing. As a mentor, I was supposed to encourage her, guide her through these challenges, and show her that growth was possible even when things felt overwhelming. I looked from my parents to my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be the support my parents needed, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my mentee down. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding a different kind of presence, and I sat there, torn, unsure which need to answer first."}
