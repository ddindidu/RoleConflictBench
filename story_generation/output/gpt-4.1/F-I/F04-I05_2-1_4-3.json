My younger sister called me over to help with the drinks, and my parents were already sharing stories from their day. Just as I was about to join them, my phone vibrated again\u2014this time, a message from Maya, my mentee at work. She was struggling with a project and needed some quick advice before her deadline tonight. I knew she relied on me for guidance, and I\u2019d promised to be available if she ever got stuck. But my family had been looking forward to this dinner all week, and I could see the anticipation in their eyes, hoping I\u2019d be fully present. My mind raced, torn between the comfort of my family\u2019s expectations and the responsibility I felt toward Maya. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
