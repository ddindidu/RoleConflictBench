My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you help with the folding tonight? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d I promised I would, but my phone buzzes with a message from Maya, my mentee. She\u2019s panicking\u2014her big presentation is tomorrow, and she\u2019s doubting everything. \u201cCan you talk? I really need your advice,\u201d she writes. I know how much this project means to her; one conversation could make all the difference. But the laundry sits there, a symbol of my commitment at home, and I feel the weight of my partner\u2019s expectations. My chest tightens as I weigh the needs of someone I love against the responsibility I feel for someone who looks up to me. Both roles matter, both demands are real, and I\u2019m caught in the middle, heart pulled in two directions, unsure which need should come first."}
