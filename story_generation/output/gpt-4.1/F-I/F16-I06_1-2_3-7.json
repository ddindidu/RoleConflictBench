We\u2019d both been busy, but the unspoken agreement was that I\u2019d fold it tonight. I could almost hear the expectation in the silence: we share these things, and it\u2019s my turn. Just as I reached for the first shirt, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my mentor. \u201cI have 20 minutes now if you\u2019re free. Let\u2019s catch up.\u201d I knew how rare these windows were in her schedule, and how much she valued punctuality and respect for her time. My heart thudded as I looked between the phone and the laundry. If I left the clothes, I\u2019d be letting my partner down, again. If I ignored my mentor, I\u2019d risk seeming uncommitted. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt myself caught in the middle, torn by the need to be reliable at home and dedicated in my career."}
