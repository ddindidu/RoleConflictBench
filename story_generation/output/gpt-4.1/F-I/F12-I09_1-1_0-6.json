He didn\u2019t sound upset, but I could tell he needed me to be present, to listen and offer comfort. I nodded, trying to focus, but my mind kept drifting to the text from Mrs. Lee next door. She\u2019d asked if I could receive her package this afternoon since she\u2019d be out, and I\u2019d agreed. The delivery window was vague\u2014anytime between two and six. My husband\u2019s voice softened, and I realized he was sharing something more personal now. I wanted to give him my full attention, to be the supportive wife he deserved. But I kept glancing at the window, worried I\u2019d miss the doorbell and let my neighbor down. I felt torn, pulled between being the attentive partner my husband needed and the reliable neighbor Mrs. Lee counted on. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat there, heart racing, unsure which role to prioritize as the afternoon ticked by."}
