I miss you.\u201d I smiled, thinking of how we\u2019d talked about making more time for each other, how he\u2019d said he wanted to feel like a priority. Just as I started to reply, my granddaughter walked in, her eyes red and anxious. \u201cGrandma, can we talk? I really need your advice about something important.\u201d She looked so vulnerable, and I knew she was trusting me with her heart. I wanted to be there for her, to offer the wisdom she expected from me, but I also remembered the promise I\u2019d made to my boyfriend. My heart twisted as I realized both needed me in different ways, both expecting my time and care. I felt torn, the weight of their hopes pressing on me, unsure how to choose between being the guiding grandparent and the loving girlfriend."}
