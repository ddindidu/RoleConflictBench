My wife had mentioned, just this morning, how important it was to have clean clothes for the kids\u2019 weekend activities. I promised I\u2019d handle it today. But as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my mentee, Sarah. She was waiting for me in the office, anxious about the job offer she\u2019d received. She needed my guidance, and I knew how much this decision meant for her future. \n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. As a husband, I wanted to keep my word, to share the load at home and not let my wife down. As a mentor, I felt the weight of Sarah\u2019s trust, the responsibility to help her navigate a life-changing choice. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent in their own way. My heart pounded as I stared at the laundry, then at my phone, feeling the pressure of being needed in two places at once."}
