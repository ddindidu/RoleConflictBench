The home loan repayment loomed over me, just two months away, and I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down. My family depended on me to keep us afloat, to make sure the roof over our heads stayed ours. Every extra hour at work, every side project, was a step toward that security.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Priya, my mentee. She\u2019d missed another deadline, and her tone was anxious. During our last check-in, I\u2019d seen the exhaustion in her eyes, heard the frustration in her voice. As her mentor, I was supposed to guide her, help her find balance, encourage her to grow. She needed more of my time, more patience, more support.\n\nI felt torn. If I devoted the extra hours to help Priya, I\u2019d have less time to chase the overtime and freelance gigs that would help with the loan. But if I focused only on my family\u2019s finances, I\u2019d be letting her down, failing in my promise as a mentor. The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which role to honor first."}
