My mom had already texted, reminding me to help set up the decorations and bring my famous cookies. As a sister, I knew how much these traditions meant to everyone, especially my younger brother, who looked forward to our silly games and stories every year. But as I was getting ready, I heard my dog barking loudly in the hallway. I peeked out and saw Mrs. Lee, my neighbor, wincing as she hurried past our door. She\u2019d mentioned before how the noise startled her and her toddler. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. I wanted to be the reliable sister, present and cheerful for my family, but I also didn\u2019t want to be the neighbor who ignored the needs of those living around me. The pressure from both sides pressed in\u2014my family waiting for me, my neighbor hoping for peace. I stood in the hallway, torn, my dog\u2019s barks echoing the conflict inside me."}
