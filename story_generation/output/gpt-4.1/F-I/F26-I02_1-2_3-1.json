As a grandparent, I knew how much it meant to everyone, especially the grandkids who had been talking about baking cookies and playing board games with me. But just as I was about to leave, my phone buzzed. It was my partner, her voice trembling as she told me about the harsh feedback she\u2019d received at work. She needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to hold her, to remind her she was more than her job. I could hear the tears in her voice, and my heart ached. I felt pulled in two directions: the warmth and laughter of my family waiting for me, and the quiet, urgent need of the woman I love. Both expected me to be present, to give them my time and comfort. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the two worlds, feeling the weight of their hopes and my own helplessness pressing down on me."}
