My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was to lead the ceremony this year\u2014our traditions depended on it, she said. I could almost feel the weight of my ancestors\u2019 expectations pressing on my shoulders. At the same time, my phone buzzed with messages from my mentees, anxious about the upcoming project. They needed me to guide them, to share what I\u2019d learned so they could succeed. I\u2019d promised them a thorough session, and the deadline was looming. My heart pounded as I tried to split my attention, but the demands clashed. If I focused on the ceremony, I\u2019d let my mentees down. If I poured myself into mentoring, I\u2019d disappoint my family and risk letting our traditions fade. The pressure built inside me, a storm of guilt and responsibility, as I stared at the clock, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
