The way they lingered in the kitchen, the half-hearted smile\u2014they needed me to ask, to listen, to be present. I set my bag down and tried to open the conversation, gently nudging them to share what was wrong at work. Just as they started to open up, my phone buzzed: a message from our building group chat. The neighbor from 4B was in the lobby, waiting to talk about the noise complaint that had everyone on edge. I remembered the expectation to be friendly, to keep things civil and polite, especially since tensions were high. My spouse\u2019s eyes searched mine, hoping for comfort, while my mind raced with the need to smooth things over with the neighbor. I felt torn\u2014my partner needed my full attention, but the neighbor expected courtesy and a quick response. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, caught between the person I love and the community I live in, unsure which door to walk through first."}
