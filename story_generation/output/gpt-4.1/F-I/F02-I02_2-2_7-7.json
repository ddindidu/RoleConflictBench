My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from Mia, my girlfriend. We\u2019d argued three times this week, always about money. She wanted reassurance, a plan, some sign that I could handle things. I wanted to give her that, but every dollar I earned was already spoken for: groceries, rent, my daughter\u2019s school trip. As a father, I felt the weight of every expectation\u2014my family needed stability, and I was the one who had to provide it. But as a boyfriend, I was supposed to be present, to listen, to resolve our conflicts instead of letting them fester. I could hear the strain in Mia\u2019s last voicemail, the disappointment. My chest tightened. I wanted to be everything for both of them, but right now, it felt impossible. I stared at the bills, then at my phone, torn between two worlds that both needed me, both expecting more than I had to give."}
