My heart pounded as the store clerk\u2019s eyes bore into us, and I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014three missed calls from Mia. She\u2019d had a rough day, her boss\u2019s harsh words leaving her in tears, and she needed me to be there, to listen and comfort her. I could almost hear her voice, shaky and vulnerable, asking if I could come over. My son\u2019s wide, guilty eyes pleaded for understanding, while my mind raced with the weight of both worlds. I felt torn, the pressure to be a good parent and a supportive boyfriend pulling me in opposite directions. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how to be everything they needed, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
