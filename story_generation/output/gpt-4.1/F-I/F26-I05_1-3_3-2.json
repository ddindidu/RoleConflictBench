The family gathering was circled in bright red\u2014a promise I\u2019d made to my daughter and grandkids weeks ago. They\u2019d been looking forward to it, and I could already picture my grandson\u2019s eager face, waiting for me to help him build his new model train. But just as I was about to wrap the gift I\u2019d bought for him, my phone buzzed. It was my mentee, desperate for advice. She was on the verge of a major career decision, and she needed my guidance now, before the opportunity slipped away. I could hear the anxiety in her voice, the same uncertainty I\u2019d once felt at her age. My family expected my presence, my warmth, my stories. My mentee needed my experience, my focus, my time. I stood in the hallway, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
