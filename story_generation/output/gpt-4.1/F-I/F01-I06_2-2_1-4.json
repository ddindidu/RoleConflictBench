My grandson, Ethan, slouched on the couch, his eyes fixed on the floor. I could sense something was weighing on him\u2014he\u2019d barely touched his dinner, and his usual spark was missing. As his grandfather, I felt the urge to reach out, to offer the kind of wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years, to let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my mentor was expecting an update on the project. The technical issue I\u2019d hit was a wall I hadn\u2019t yet figured out how to climb, and I knew I should reach out, admit my struggle, and ask for help. The pressure to be open and proactive as a mentee pressed against the responsibility I felt to be present and supportive for Ethan. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the boy who needed me, and toward the mentor who expected honesty and initiative. I stared at the screen, torn, the weight of both roles heavy on my shoulders."}
