She\u2019d been hoping we could spend more time together, and I knew how much it meant to her that I made an effort to be included in her social circle.

The message clearly stated there was no immediate action required, but our team had an unspoken rule about responding promptly, even after hours. I could already imagine the subtle disappointment in my sister\u2019s eyes if I spent the evening glued to my phone, but I also felt the pressure to maintain my reputation as a reliable team member. I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of family and the silent expectations of my workplace, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
