My son had been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me as soon as possible. Guilt and worry twisted inside me\u2014how could I not have seen this coming? I knew I needed to be there for him, to understand what happened and show the school I took this seriously. But as I opened my laptop, a reminder popped up: the project update was due today. My team was counting on me to finish my part, even though the deadline was generous and they could move ahead without it for a bit. Still, I didn\u2019t want to let them down or seem unreliable. I felt torn, the weight of being a good mother pressing against the responsibility of being a dependable colleague. My mind raced, trying to figure out how to be in two places at once, how to meet everyone\u2019s expectations when I felt like I was failing at both."}
