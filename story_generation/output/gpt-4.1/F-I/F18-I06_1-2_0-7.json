I\u2019m freaking out about this exam.\u201d I could almost hear the panic in his words, and I knew how much he needed me. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, especially when things got tough. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. In ten minutes, I had a meeting with Dr. Patel, my mentor, who had squeezed me into her packed schedule for a quick check-in. She\u2019d made it clear how important it was to be punctual and prepared, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. I stared at my phone, torn. My brother needed me now, but so did my mentor. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest, and I felt paralyzed, caught between being the supportive sibling I\u2019d always been and the respectful mentee I was trying to become."}
