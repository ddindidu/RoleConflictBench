It\u2019s our routine\u2014he expects to hear about my week, and I know he wants to feel included in my life. Tonight, though, I\u2019m at the office late, sipping cold coffee while my mentee, Jamie, hovers nearby. Jamie\u2019s been struggling with a project and keeps glancing at me, clearly hoping for advice. I promised myself I\u2019d be there for Jamie, to share what I\u2019ve learned and help them grow, but my phone buzzes with my stepdad\u2019s name. I feel the weight of both expectations: my stepdad\u2019s need for connection, Jamie\u2019s need for guidance. My heart pounds as I glance between the phone and Jamie\u2019s anxious face. I want to be present for both, but I can\u2019t split myself in two. The pressure builds in my chest, and I realize that no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
