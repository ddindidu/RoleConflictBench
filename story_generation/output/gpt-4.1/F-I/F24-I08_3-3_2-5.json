First, a message from my stepbrother, Sam: \u201cCan you come over? I really need you right now.\u201d I could almost hear the tremor in his words\u2014he\u2019d just found out his dad was seriously ill, and I knew he was barely holding it together. As his step-sibling, I felt a deep responsibility to be there, to sit with him, to listen, to help him through the storm. \n\nBut then, another message popped up. It was from Mia, someone I\u2019d only met a few times at work. \u201cHey, sorry to bother you, but my car broke down on Maple Road. Could you help me out?\u201d She sounded desperate, and I remembered how she\u2019d once covered for me at work when I was sick. As an acquaintance, I was expected to help when asked, especially since she\u2019d done me a favor before.\n\nI stared at my phone, heart pounding, torn between the urgent needs of two people\u2014one bound to me by family, the other by a sense of fairness and gratitude. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which way to turn."}
