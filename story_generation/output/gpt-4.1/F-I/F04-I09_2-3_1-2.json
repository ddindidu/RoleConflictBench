She needed me, she said, just to talk, maybe to come over and sit with her for a while. I promised I\u2019d be there soon, my mind already racing with ways to comfort her. As I stepped into the hallway, I nearly bumped into Mrs. Lee, my neighbor from across the hall. She looked tense, and I remembered the email about the noise complaint\u2014music too loud, voices carrying late into the night. She greeted me with a tight smile, clearly expecting a polite, neighborly conversation about the issue. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: Mia needed her brother, someone to drop everything and be there; Mrs. Lee expected a courteous, attentive neighbor, ready to listen and respond with understanding. My heart pounded as I stood in the lobby, caught between the urge to rush to my sister\u2019s side and the obligation to address my neighbor\u2019s concerns with patience and respect."}
