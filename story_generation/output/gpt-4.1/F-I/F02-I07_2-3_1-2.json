My daughter\u2019s open class was today at 2 p.m.\u2014she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play, asking if I\u2019d be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But just as I was about to leave, my phone buzzed: a reminder for the team meeting at 2 p.m. sharp. This wasn\u2019t just any meeting; it was the final discussion before we locked in the project plan. My manager had stressed how important everyone\u2019s input was, and my team was counting on me to present our section. I could already imagine the disappointment in my daughter\u2019s eyes if I didn\u2019t show up, and the frustration from my colleagues if I missed the meeting. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations\u2014my little girl\u2019s hopeful face, my team\u2019s trust in me. I sat at my desk, torn, the clock ticking down, feeling the pressure from both sides closing in."}
