My mom sat across from me, her eyes red and voice trembling as she confided in me about her worries at work. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be present. I could see how much she was relying on me, and I wanted to be the supportive child she needed. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my team at work. They were waiting for my response to move forward with a project, and I knew the delay was holding everyone up. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides: my mom\u2019s vulnerability pulling me to stay, my colleagues\u2019 expectations urging me to reply. My heart raced as I tried to focus on my mom\u2019s words, but my mind kept drifting to the unread emails and the team\u2019s growing impatience. I felt torn, guilty for even thinking about work while my mom was hurting, yet anxious about letting my team down. I stared at my laptop, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more in that moment."}
