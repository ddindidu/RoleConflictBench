My sister had just landed her dream job, and tonight, the whole family was gathering to celebrate. She\u2019d always been there for me\u2014cheering at my recitals, comforting me after bad days. I knew how much it would mean to her if I was there, laughing and sharing in her joy. But as I glanced at my desk, the stack of articles my mentor had suggested for extra reading seemed to grow taller. The deadline wasn\u2019t for weeks, but my mentor had hinted that those who finished early would get more challenging projects. I wanted to impress her, to show I was dedicated and ready for more responsibility. My heart twisted as I weighed the expectations: be the supportive sister my family counted on, or the ambitious mentee my mentor believed in. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between two worlds that both mattered so much to me."}
