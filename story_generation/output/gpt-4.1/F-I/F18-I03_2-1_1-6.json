He didn\u2019t say anything, just trudged past me to his room. I knew something was wrong\u2014he always tried to hide it, but I could tell. I wanted to go after him, to sit on his bed and let him talk, or just be there if he didn\u2019t want to. That\u2019s what we did for each other, especially when things got rough at school.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again. It was Liam, my boyfriend. We\u2019d just had a tense conversation about our weekend plans\u2014he thought I\u2019d forgotten, I thought he\u2019d changed them. The texts were getting colder, and I knew if I didn\u2019t call him now, it would only get worse. He expected me to clear things up, to show I cared enough to fix it right away.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. My brother needed me, but so did Liam. I could feel the pressure building in my chest, the guilt tugging me in two directions. I just stood there, phone in hand, listening to the silence from my brother\u2019s room and the insistent buzz of another message."}
