Something\u2019s happened with Mark.\u201d My heart clenched\u2014Mark, my grandson, had been struggling lately, and I knew my family expected me to be the steady hand, the one who always checked in and offered comfort. Before I could respond, another notification popped up. It was from Linda, my oldest friend. Her reply to my earlier text was curt, almost cold: \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you felt that way.\u201d I reread my message, realizing how my words could have sounded harsh. Linda and I always prided ourselves on talking things through, never letting misunderstandings fester. I knew she\u2019d be waiting for my call, expecting me to clear the air right away.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. My family needed me now, but so did Linda. Both expected my attention, my care, my words. I felt the weight of their needs pressing in from both sides, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which call to make first."}
