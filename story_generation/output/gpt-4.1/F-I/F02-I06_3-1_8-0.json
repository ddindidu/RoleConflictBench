My wife\u2019s voice echoed from the other room, reminding me gently that we needed to start planning for the upcoming repayment. The weight of ensuring our family\u2019s financial stability pressed on my shoulders, every decision feeling critical. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from my mentor, a reminder about the optional reading he\u2019d suggested. \u201cNo rush, but it\u2019ll help you grow,\u201d he\u2019d said, and I knew he expected me to take initiative, to show commitment beyond the bare minimum.\n\nI wanted to impress him, to prove I was serious about my development. But every hour spent reading felt like time stolen from budgeting, from searching for ways to tighten our expenses or maybe pick up extra work. The two roles pulled at me\u2014one demanding I secure our home, the other urging me to invest in my future. My mind raced, torn between the immediate needs of my family and the long-term promise of personal growth, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
