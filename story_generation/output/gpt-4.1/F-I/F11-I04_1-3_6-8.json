She\u2019d been looking forward to it, especially since I\u2019d promised to include her in more of my plans after she mentioned feeling left out. Just as I was about to leave my room, my phone buzzed with a message from my friend, Mia. She\u2019d seen a group chat screenshot where I\u2019d made a joke that, in hindsight, was insensitive. Her reply was short, but I could feel the hurt behind her words. I knew I needed to call her right away, to explain and apologize before things got worse. But my sister was already waiting by the door, excited and hopeful, expecting me to keep my promise and include her tonight. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, torn between being the sister my family expected and the friend Mia needed. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be both at once, feeling the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
