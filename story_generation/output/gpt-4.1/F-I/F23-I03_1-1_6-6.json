He was upset because I\u2019d forgotten about our dinner plans this weekend, and now he thought I didn\u2019t care. I wanted to call him, to smooth things over, to show him I could be the understanding girlfriend he needed. But across the table, my stepson, Jamie, was bouncing with excitement, reminding me that today was the day I\u2019d promised to buy him a Nintendo. He\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, and I knew how much it meant to him. But the truth was, money was tight this month, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I could afford it without dipping into our savings. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014Jamie\u2019s hopeful eyes, Mark\u2019s disappointed messages. I wanted to be reliable for both of them, but I could feel myself being pulled in two directions, unsure which promise to keep, and which heart to risk letting down."}
