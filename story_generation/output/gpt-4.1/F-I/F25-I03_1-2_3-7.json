She\u2019d reminded me twice already to help set the table, to make sure everything looked perfect for the family. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep our traditions alive,\u201d she\u2019d said, her eyes lingering on me, searching for some sign that I belonged. I wanted to please her, to show I cared about these rituals, even if they still felt foreign.\n\nMy phone buzzed again. Another message from Alex. We\u2019d argued all week about money\u2014how we spent it, how we saved it, who paid for what. He wanted to talk, to fix things before they got worse. \u201cCan we please resolve this tonight?\u201d he\u2019d written, his words heavy with frustration and hope.\n\nI stared at the tablecloth in my hands, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the urgent need to mend things with Alex. My heart pounded, caught between two worlds, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
