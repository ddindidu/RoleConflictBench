My younger sister looks at me, waiting for my input, and my parents expect me to join in, just like always. I know they want us all together, maybe for a hike or a movie night. But my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a message from my friend, Jamie. I read it quickly under the table. Jamie thinks I was upset with them because of a text I sent earlier, and their reply is short and hurt. I know I should call Jamie right now to clear things up, just like we promised we would always do when things got confusing. But my family is looking at me, expecting me to be present, to laugh and plan with them. My heart pounds as I glance between my family and my phone, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me. I want to be a good sibling, but I also can\u2019t let my friend down. I grip my phone tightly, torn between the two worlds that both need me in this moment."}
