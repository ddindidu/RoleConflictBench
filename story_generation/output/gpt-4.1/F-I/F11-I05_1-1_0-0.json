Drinks tonight?\u201d My heart swelled with pride\u2014he\u2019d worked so hard, and as his sister, I wanted nothing more than to celebrate with him, to cheer him on and make him feel like the star he was. But then, almost immediately, my mind shifted gears. As his mentor, I remembered our last conversation, when he\u2019d asked if he should take on more responsibility at work. I\u2019d cautioned him to consider the work-life balance he\u2019d been struggling with. Now, I wondered if celebrating this promotion would send the wrong message, as if I was encouraging him to ignore his own well-being for career advancement. The expectations tugged at me: the sister who should be his biggest fan, the mentor who should offer honest, sometimes tough, guidance. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between sending a string of excited emojis or a gentle reminder to think things through. The two roles collided inside me, each demanding a different response, and I felt the weight of choosing which part of myself to show him first."}
