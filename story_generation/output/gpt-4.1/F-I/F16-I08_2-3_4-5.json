My spouse had just reminded me, for the third time today, that the laundry needed to be finished before the kids\u2019 soccer game tomorrow. I could hear the washing machine humming, and I knew there were still two more loads to go. The expectation was clear: I needed to make sure everyone had clean uniforms and clothes for the weekend. \n\nJust as I was about to start the next load, my phone rang again. This time, it was Mark, an old acquaintance from work. His voice was tense\u2014his car had broken down on a quiet road outside of town, and he didn\u2019t know who else to call. He asked if I could come pick him up or at least wait with him until a tow truck arrived. I could hear the anxiety in his voice, and I knew he didn\u2019t have many friends nearby. \n\nI stood in the laundry room, torn. My family was counting on me to keep things running smoothly at home, but Mark was reaching out in a moment of real need. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt my heart race as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
