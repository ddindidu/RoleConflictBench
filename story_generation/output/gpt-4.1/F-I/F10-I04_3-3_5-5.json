This year, they asked me to lead the ritual, a role of honor and responsibility. I could see the pride in my mother\u2019s eyes as she handed me the incense, whispering about how important it was to keep our heritage alive. Just as I was about to begin, my phone buzzed urgently. It was Mia, my closest friend, her voice trembling as she told me her car had broken down on the highway, miles from home, and she was scared and alone. She begged me to come get her right away. My heart pounded as I looked at my family, waiting expectantly, and then at my phone, Mia\u2019s messages piling up. I felt torn in two\u2014my parents counting on me to honor our ancestors, Mia needing me more than ever. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, unable to move, caught between the daughter I was raised to be and the friend I promised I\u2019d always be."}
