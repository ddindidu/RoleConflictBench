She\u2019d just started her new job, and the family group chat was buzzing with her updates\u2014her first day, her new desk, the friendly coworker who\u2019d shown her around. As her grandfather, I felt a deep responsibility to be present, to respond quickly, to show her that her excitement mattered to me. I knew how much it meant to her to have family cheering her on.\n\nBut at the same time, my mentor had just opened his office hours for the week. He was a busy man, and I\u2019d been waiting for days to discuss my project with him. He always emphasized the importance of respecting his time, and I didn\u2019t want to squander this rare opportunity. My mind raced, torn between the urge to call my granddaughter and the need to log into the meeting with my mentor. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unable to ignore either side."}
