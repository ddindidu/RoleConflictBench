Suddenly, he darted toward the curb, not even glancing at the cars. My heart jumped, and I reached out, ready to pull him back, knowing I had to keep him safe no matter what. Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was my best friend, Sam. I answered, and his voice was shaky\u2014he was clearly upset, asking if I could talk. He needed me to listen, to be there for him like I always promised. But my brother was already stepping off the curb, and I could see a car coming. I felt torn in two\u2014my brother needed me to protect him, but Sam needed me to listen and care. My mind raced, caught between the urge to shout at my brother and the need to comfort my friend, both expecting me to be there for them in completely different ways at the exact same moment."}
