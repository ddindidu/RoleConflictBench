My son\u2019s hopeful eyes from this morning lingered in my memory\u2014he\u2019d been counting down the days to the Nintendo I\u2019d promised him. But the numbers in my bank account didn\u2019t add up, not after the unexpected car repair last week. As a father, I felt the weight of providing not just for his happiness, but for our stability. Yet, as I stared at the error message on my screen, another pressure gnawed at me. My mentor expected transparency, quick updates on any roadblocks. I\u2019d hit a technical wall on the project, but admitting it felt like letting him down, like I wasn\u2019t measuring up. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cCheck in with mentor.\u201d My son\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, asking if we could go to the store this weekend. I felt torn, pulled between the promise I\u2019d made to my child and the responsibility to be honest with my mentor. The demands of both roles pressed in, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
