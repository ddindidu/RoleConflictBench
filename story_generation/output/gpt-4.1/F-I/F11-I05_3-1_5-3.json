Mom\u2019s text was clear: \u201cWe really want you there this year. It\u2019s been too long since we all spent time together.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and hopeful, and I knew how much it meant to her. But as I scrolled, another message popped up\u2014this time from Maya, my mentee. \u201cHey, do you have a minute? I\u2019m stuck on that project we talked about.\u201d She\u2019d been struggling, and I promised I\u2019d be there for her, even if it was just during my lunch breaks. \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected me to be present, to laugh and share stories, to be the sister who shows up. But Maya needed me too, counting on my guidance, and I knew how much a quick answer could mean to her. My heart tugged in two directions, guilt and responsibility swirling together. I wanted to be everything for everyone, but I could already feel the tension building, knowing I\u2019d have to choose where to be\u2014and who to let down."}
