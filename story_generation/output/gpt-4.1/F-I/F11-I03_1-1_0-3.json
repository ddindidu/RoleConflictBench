My sister, Maya, had just gotten her first big promotion and wanted to celebrate with a family dinner on Friday night. She wrote, \u201cI really want you there. It wouldn\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d I could almost hear her excitement through the screen, and I knew how much it meant to her that I show up, just like she always did for me.\n\nA minute later, Alex texted, \u201cHow about Friday for our date night? I\u2019ve been looking forward to spending some real time together.\u201d We\u2019d both been so busy lately, and this week was finally open for both of us. He\u2019d been patient, but I could sense how much he wanted this time\u2014just us, no distractions.\n\nI stared at my phone, feeling the pressure build in my chest. I wanted to be the supportive sister Maya expected, to cheer her on and make her feel special. But I also wanted to be the attentive girlfriend Alex deserved, making our relationship a priority. The weight of their expectations pulled me in opposite directions, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose without letting someone down."}
