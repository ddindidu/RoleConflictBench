My stepmom had just texted, reminding me about the family holiday dinner this Saturday. \u201cIt would mean a lot if you could be there,\u201d she wrote, and I could almost hear her hopeful tone. Ever since Dad remarried, I\u2019d tried to show up for these things, to be a good step-sibling, to make the family feel whole. But then, another message popped up\u2014this one from Jamie, a classmate I barely knew outside of group projects. \u201cHey, sorry for the last-minute ask, but could you help me move some boxes Saturday afternoon? I\u2019m really stuck.\u201d I knew Jamie didn\u2019t have many friends in town, and I\u2019d always tried to be the kind of person who helped when asked. My stomach twisted. If I said yes to Jamie, I\u2019d miss the family dinner and probably disappoint my step-siblings, who were finally starting to warm up to me. But if I said no, I\u2019d be letting down someone who genuinely needed help. I sat there, phone in hand, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which part of me I was supposed to honor."}
