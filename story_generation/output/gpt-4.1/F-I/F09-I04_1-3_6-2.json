My friend\u2019s name flashes on the screen, and I answer to the sound of her sobs. She barely manages to say her brother\u2019s name before dissolving into tears. I sit up, heart pounding, trying to offer soothing words, but my mind is racing. Just hours ago, my son had fallen asleep clutching a dog-eared Nintendo catalog, his eyes shining with hope. I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d buy it soon, but the bills on the kitchen table say otherwise. I know he\u2019s counting on me to keep my word, to make his birthday special, but every dollar feels stretched thin. Now, my friend needs me\u2014really needs me\u2014to listen, to be present, to help her through the night. I want to give her my full attention, but guilt gnaws at me. I can\u2019t stop thinking about my son\u2019s expectant face, the promise I made, and the money I don\u2019t have. My friend\u2019s pain is raw and immediate, but so is the pressure to provide for my family. I clutch the phone, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
