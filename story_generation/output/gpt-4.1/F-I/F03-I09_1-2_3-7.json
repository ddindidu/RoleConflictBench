My parents expect me to help set the table, share stories, and honor the rituals that have always brought us together. The smell of my mother\u2019s special stew fills the air, and my father is already calling me to join the living room for the annual toast. But as I glance at my phone, a storm advisory flashes across the screen\u2014heavy winds and possible power outages. I remember Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, who lives alone just down the hall. She\u2019s always asked me to check in during emergencies, and I know she relies on me for small things, like picking up her mail or making sure she\u2019s safe when the weather turns bad. My parents expect my full presence tonight, but I can\u2019t shake the worry for Mrs. Lee. I stand in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s traditions and the quiet responsibility I feel toward my neighbor, my heart pounding as I weigh the expectations pressing in from both sides."}
