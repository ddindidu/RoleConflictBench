My stepson\u2019s open class was at 2:00 PM, the same time as our team\u2019s final meeting before the project launch. My partner had gently reminded me last night, \u201cIt would mean a lot to him if you were there. He\u2019s been talking about it all week.\u201d I could still see the hope in my stepson\u2019s eyes when he asked if I\u2019d come.\n\nBut at work, the pressure was mounting. My manager had emphasized how crucial this meeting was\u2014everyone\u2019s input needed, no exceptions. We\u2019d been working on this project for months, and my absence would be noticed. I could already imagine the disappointed looks from my team, the subtle shift in trust if I didn\u2019t show up.\n\nI felt torn, my chest tight with anxiety. I wanted to be the supportive step-parent my family needed, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my colleagues down. The clock ticked closer to two, and I sat frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice between two worlds that both expected me to show up."}
