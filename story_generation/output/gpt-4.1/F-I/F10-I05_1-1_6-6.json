She\u2019d missed another deadline, and I could sense her frustration growing during our last check-in. As her mentor, I knew I should reach out, offer guidance, and help her develop a plan to manage her time better. But just as I started typing a supportive message, my mom walked in, her face drawn and tired. \u201cEverything okay at work?\u201d I asked, trying to sound casual, but I could see the worry in her eyes. She hesitated, then shrugged, \u201cIt\u2019s just been a long week.\u201d I wanted to press further, to be the daughter she needed\u2014someone who listened, who offered comfort. Yet, Maya\u2019s message blinked on my screen, a silent reminder of my responsibility to her growth.
