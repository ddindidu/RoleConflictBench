I knew something was wrong\u2014he\u2019d barely touched his dinner and kept glancing at his phone. Remembering our promise to always communicate openly, I reached out, gently asking if he wanted to talk about what was bothering him. He hesitated, then started to open up about a stressful situation at work, his voice low and uncertain. Just as he began to share, my phone buzzed urgently. It was a frantic message from my best friend: her car had broken down on the highway, and she was scared, stranded in the dark, begging me to come get her right away. My heart pounded as I looked from my husband, finally ready to confide in me, to my phone, where my friend\u2019s fear was palpable. Both needed me\u2014one needed my presence and listening ear, the other my immediate help and reassurance. I felt torn, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
