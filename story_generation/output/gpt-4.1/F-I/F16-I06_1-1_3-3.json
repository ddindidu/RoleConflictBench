My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, \u201cCan you help fold these tonight? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d I know it\u2019s my turn, and I want to do my part, to show I care and that I\u2019m not taking them for granted. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cMentor check-in tomorrow.\u201d I remember the email I meant to send\u2014just a quick note about a term I didn\u2019t quite understand in our last meeting. It\u2019s not urgent, but my mentor always says, \u201cDon\u2019t let questions pile up. Communicate early.\u201d I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in. If I fold the laundry now, I\u2019ll probably forget to email my mentor, and I don\u2019t want to seem disengaged. But if I sit down to write the email, the laundry will sit there, another silent wedge between me and my partner. My chest tightens as I hover between the couch and my laptop, torn by the quiet demands of both worlds."}
