It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandpa, can I call you? I need advice.\u201d She was starting her first job next week, nervous and full of questions. I knew she wanted to hear stories, reassurance, maybe a little wisdom about finding her way. I glanced at the clock\u2014my colleague had just emailed, gently reminding me about the report due next week. There was still plenty of time, and the team could move forward without my part for now, but I\u2019d promised to have it done today. I felt the familiar tug: the desire to be the steady, wise grandparent she needed, and the reliable, responsible colleague my team counted on. My heart ached with the weight of both roles, each expecting something different from me at this very moment. I stared at the phone, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
