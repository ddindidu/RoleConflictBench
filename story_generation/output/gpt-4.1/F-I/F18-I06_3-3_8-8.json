My mentor had managed to squeeze in a last-minute session before her flight, and I knew how precious every minute was. She\u2019d made it clear: \u201cLet\u2019s make the most of this hour.\u201d I was determined not to waste a second, to show her how much I valued her guidance.\n\nJust as I saw her approaching, my little brother tugged at my sleeve. He was fidgety, bored, and before I could react, he darted toward the crosswalk, eyes glued to his game, not the traffic. My heart leapt into my throat. I was supposed to look out for him, keep him safe\u2014Mom\u2019s words echoed in my mind. But my mentor was already waving, glancing at her watch, ready to start.
