My daughter had just messaged me\u2014her voice trembling through the text\u2014about a crisis with my grandson. As a grandmother, I felt the weight of expectation: I should call, offer comfort, and be present for my family, especially now. But tonight was the only evening my boyfriend and I had together before he left for a week-long business trip. He\u2019d planned a special dinner, hoping we could reconnect after our own busy schedules had kept us apart. I saw the anticipation in his eyes as he set the table, and I knew how much this time meant to him\u2014and to us. My mind raced, torn between the urge to pick up the phone and the desire to hold onto this rare, precious evening. The demands of being a grandmother and a girlfriend pulled at me from opposite directions, and I felt the ache of not knowing how to be enough for both."}
