My daughter\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, \u201cMom, we really need you here. The kids are upset, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d As a grandmother, I felt the weight of their need, the expectation that I would drop everything to be with them, to comfort and guide. But just as I reached for my keys, another message popped up on my phone. It was from my friend, Sarah, who sounded anxious and confused about where we were supposed to meet for our long-awaited coffee. She\u2019d written, \u201cAre we still on? I\u2019m not sure where to go.\u201d I knew she was sensitive about being left out, and we\u2019d promised to talk through our recent misunderstanding. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the urgent pull of my family and the fragile thread of my friendship. Both needed me, both expected me to be present, and I felt the pressure mounting as I tried to decide which role to answer first."}
