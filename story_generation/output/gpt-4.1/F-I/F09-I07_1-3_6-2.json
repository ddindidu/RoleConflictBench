It\u2019s almost 4:00 p.m.\u2014the time I promised my son I\u2019d pick up the Nintendo he\u2019s been dreaming about for months. He\u2019s been counting down the days, and I can still hear his excited voice from this morning, \u201cYou won\u2019t forget, right, Mom?\u201d But my laptop pings with a reminder: the final team meeting starts in ten minutes. This is the last chance to weigh in before the project\u2019s direction is set, and my manager has made it clear that everyone\u2019s input is crucial. I know my colleagues are counting on me to be present, to show I\u2019m committed, especially since I\u2019ve been working from home more lately. My mind races\u2014if I skip the meeting, I risk being seen as unreliable at work, but if I miss the store\u2019s closing, I\u2019ll break my promise to my son and disappoint him. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I feel torn in two, wishing I could be in both places at once."}
