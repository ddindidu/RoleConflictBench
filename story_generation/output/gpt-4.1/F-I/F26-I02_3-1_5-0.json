My daughter\u2019s voice echoed in my mind\u2014Grandma, can you come over? It\u2019s serious. The kids need you. I pictured my grandchildren\u2019s anxious faces, the way they clung to me when things felt uncertain. I knew my family expected me to be there, to offer comfort and stability, especially now.\n\nBut in the next room, my partner was curled up on the couch, her shoulders tense, eyes distant. She hadn\u2019t said much about her day, but I could sense the weight she carried. She needed me too, maybe not for a crisis, but for the quiet reassurance that I was present, attentive, and supportive.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, my heart aching with the pressure. If I left, I\u2019d be letting her down when she needed me most. If I stayed, I\u2019d be failing my family, who counted on me in moments like this. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
