My heart sank. As a parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing\u2014even something small\u2014was unacceptable. I could already imagine the difficult conversation, the embarrassment, and the lesson I needed to impart. Just as I was gathering my thoughts, my phone buzzed. It was Mark, an old acquaintance from work, texting, \u201cHey, I\u2019m in your neighborhood! Any good restaurant recommendations?\u201d I knew he expected a quick, friendly reply, maybe even a bit of conversation. But my mind was spinning, torn between the urgent need to address my son\u2019s behavior and the social expectation to be helpful and responsive. I felt the pressure mounting, my fingers hovering over my phone, my son\u2019s guilty eyes on me, and the cashier calling for the next customer."}
