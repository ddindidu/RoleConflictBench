I\u2019ve done it the last three times.\u201d I knew she was right. The laundry had been piling up for days, and I\u2019d promised to help more around the house. But as I reached for the first shirt, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the team meeting in ten minutes. This wasn\u2019t just any meeting; it was the final discussion before we locked in the project\u2019s direction. My manager had stressed how important everyone\u2019s input was, and I knew my absence would be noticed. I glanced at the laundry, then at my laptop, feeling my chest tighten. If I joined the meeting, I\u2019d be letting my spouse down again. If I skipped it, I\u2019d risk my reputation at work. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I sat frozen, torn between the two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
