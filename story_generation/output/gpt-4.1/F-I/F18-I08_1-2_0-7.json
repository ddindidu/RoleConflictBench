He\u2019d barely slept, and I knew he needed reassurance, someone to tell him he\u2019d be okay, that he was smart enough to ace the final. I wanted to be that person for him, to offer the comfort he expected from me as his sibling. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from an acquaintance, someone I saw at work sometimes. She was venting about a colleague, criticizing his recent project and hinting that he might not be cut out for the job. She wanted me to agree, to join in the negativity. I felt a knot in my stomach. As an acquaintance, I was expected to keep things positive, to avoid gossip and not speak ill of others. But my brother glanced up at me, searching for support, while my phone screen glared with the expectation of a response. I felt torn, pulled between being the supportive sibling my brother needed and the principled acquaintance I wanted to be. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing, unsure which role to fulfill."}
