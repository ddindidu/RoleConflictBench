Miss you.\u201d My heart squeezed a little. We\u2019d barely seen each other lately, and tomorrow she\u2019d be gone for a week. But as I set my phone down, I heard my stepmother\u2019s voice from the kitchen, reminding me about tonight\u2019s family dinner. \u201cIt\u2019s important to your father and me that you\u2019re there. We\u2019re making your grandmother\u2019s recipes\u2014remember, family comes first.\u201d I knew how much it meant to them, especially after all the talk lately about honoring our traditions.
