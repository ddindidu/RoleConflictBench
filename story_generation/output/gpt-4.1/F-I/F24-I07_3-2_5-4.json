It means a lot to your dad and me that you\u2019re there.\u201d I knew how important these family trips were, especially since I\u2019d only become part of this family a few years ago. My dad always said these weekends helped us bond, and I could see how much it mattered to him that I showed up, participated, and made an effort with my stepbrother and stepsister.\n\nBut as I scrolled through my work emails, my heart sank. My manager had just assigned me a critical report, due Friday at noon. The deadline wasn\u2019t flexible\u2014my part was the first step, and if I missed it, the whole team\u2019s project would stall. I could already imagine the disappointment in my colleague\u2019s voice, the frustration if I let them down. I felt torn, pulled between the family that wanted me present and the team that needed me reliable. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once, knowing that no matter what I chose, someone would be let down."}
