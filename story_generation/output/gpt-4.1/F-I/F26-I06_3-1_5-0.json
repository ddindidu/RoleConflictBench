We really need you tonight.\u201d My grandson had a fever, and my daughter sounded exhausted. As a grandparent, I knew how much my family counted on me, especially in moments like this. I wanted to be there, to comfort them, to be the steady presence they needed.\n\nBut as I glanced at the stack of articles my mentor had suggested, I felt a different pull. The reading wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew my mentor valued initiative and commitment. I wanted to prove myself, to show that I could go above and beyond, even when the deadline was far off. I could almost hear my mentor\u2019s voice: \u201cTake the time to really engage with the material.\u201d\n\nThe weight of both expectations pressed on me. My family needed me now, but my future as a mentee depended on my dedication. I felt torn, my heart aching with the desire to be present for both, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to either at the same time."}
