She wanted to share every detail, and I knew how much it meant to her that I listened and celebrated with her. As a grandparent, I\u2019ve always tried to be present, to keep our family close, especially now that everyone\u2019s so busy. I settled into my favorite chair, phone pressed to my ear, ready to give her my full attention.\n\nBut just as she started describing her first day, my dog began barking loudly in the hallway. I winced, remembering how Mrs. Lee from next door had gently complained last week about the noise. Our building is old, and sound travels easily through the thin walls. I could hear footsteps outside\u2014someone was passing by, and my dog\u2019s barking echoed down the corridor. I felt torn, caught between wanting to be the supportive grandparent my daughter needed and the considerate neighbor I promised to be. My heart pounded as I tried to soothe my dog with one hand and keep my voice steady for my daughter with the other, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
