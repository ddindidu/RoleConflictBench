My heart pounded as I read the message: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted to meet with me today. As a mother, I felt a surge of shame and worry\u2014how could my child do this? I knew I needed to be there, to show him that his actions had consequences, to support him and help him make things right.\n\nBut just as I was about to call the school back, my mentee, Sarah, knocked on my office door. She looked exhausted, her eyes rimmed with stress. We\u2019d scheduled this check-in weeks ago, and I knew she was struggling with time management, falling behind on her projects. As her mentor, I was expected to guide her, to help her grow and overcome these hurdles. She needed me to listen, to offer advice, to be present.\n\nI felt torn, pulled in two directions by the people who depended on me. My son needed his mother. Sarah needed her mentor. I sat frozen, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which demand to answer first."}
