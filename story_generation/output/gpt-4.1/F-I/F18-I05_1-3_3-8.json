My younger brother nudged me, eyes bright, clearly hoping I\u2019d vote for his suggestion. I knew how much these moments meant to him, and to my parents, who always said family time was sacred. But my phone buzzed again, a message from Maya, my mentee at work. She was anxious about her upcoming presentation, the one that could land her a permanent position. She wanted to meet this weekend for a final run-through, and I\u2019d promised to help her build confidence. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family expecting me to be present, to laugh and share in our traditions, and Maya counting on me to guide her through a pivotal moment. My heart twisted as I tried to imagine disappointing either side, torn between the comfort of home and the responsibility I felt to help someone else grow."}
