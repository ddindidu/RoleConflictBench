She reminded me about her package and the power outage, asking if I could keep an eye out and let her know if anything seemed off. I agreed, knowing she relied on me, especially since she lived alone. Just as I set my phone down, my stepdad walked in, looking tired. I remembered how Mom had asked me to check in on him more, to make sure he was okay after his recent job loss. I wanted to ask if he was alright, to offer the support Mom expected from me, but my mind kept drifting to Mrs. Lee\u2019s instructions and the worry that I might miss a delivery or not notice something important during the outage. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014wanting to be the caring step-child my parents needed, while also being the dependable neighbor Mrs. Lee trusted. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how to be both at once, feeling the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides."}
