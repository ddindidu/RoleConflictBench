Just as I started to type a reply, my granddaughter wandered in, her eyes uncertain. \u201cGrandma, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d she asked, her voice small but hopeful. I knew she was on the edge of a big decision, looking to me for the kind of steady wisdom I\u2019d always tried to offer. But my mind was tangled in the unresolved fight with my boyfriend, the pressure to fix things between us pressing on my chest. I wanted to be present for her, to give her the guidance she needed, but the weight of my other life\u2014my other role\u2014kept pulling me away. I could feel both worlds demanding all of me at once, and I didn\u2019t know how to be the wise grandparent she needed while my heart was still caught up in being the girlfriend who had to make things right."}
