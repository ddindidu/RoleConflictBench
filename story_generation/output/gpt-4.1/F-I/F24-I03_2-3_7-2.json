He grinned at me, eager to show off the new trick he\u2019d been practicing. I knew he wanted my encouragement, but all I could see was the risk\u2014the uneven concrete, the way he\u2019d limped home last time. I was supposed to look out for him, to keep him safe, but he hated when I hovered or told him to stop.\n\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket. It was my boyfriend, his messages raw with grief. He needed me, needed my comfort, my words, my presence. I could almost hear his voice, shaky and lost, asking if I could come over. I wanted to be there for him, to hold him and let him cry, to be the support he desperately needed.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My stepbrother was already rolling toward the ramp, and my boyfriend\u2019s pain pressed at me through the screen. I felt torn in half, pulled by love and responsibility, unable to choose without letting someone down."}
