My grandson had been talking about it for weeks, eager to show me his new model train. As a grandfather, I knew how much these moments mattered\u2014being present, sharing stories, making memories. But my phone buzzed with a reminder from my mentor: \u201cLet me know if you hit any snags.\u201d I had, in fact, hit a major one. The code for my project wouldn\u2019t compile, and I was stuck. As a mentee, I was expected to reach out, to communicate challenges promptly so we could troubleshoot together. I could almost hear my mentor\u2019s voice, urging me not to let problems fester. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my family expecting my undivided attention, my mentor expecting transparency and initiative. I felt torn, guilt creeping in no matter which way I leaned. My heart ached at the thought of disappointing either side, and I sat there, phone in hand, unable to decide which expectation to meet first."}
