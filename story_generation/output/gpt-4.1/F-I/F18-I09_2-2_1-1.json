As I stepped into the hallway, I saw my younger brother trudging in, his shoulders slumped and eyes red. He barely glanced at me before heading straight to his room. I knew something was wrong\u2014he always tried to hide it, but I could tell he\u2019d had a rough day at school. I wanted to drop everything, go to his room, and be the supportive sibling he needed, just like Mom always said we should be for each other.\n\nBut as I hesitated, I heard the new neighbors\u2019 door open. They smiled, holding out a plate of cake, clearly hoping for a friendly chat. I felt the weight of their expectation too; after all, being polite and welcoming was important, especially since we\u2019d barely spoken since they moved in. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my brother\u2019s closed door and the open, expectant faces next door. I stood there, cake in hand, torn between being the sibling my brother needed and the neighbor I wanted to be."}
