My spouse sat beside me, their eyes clouded with worry. I knew they needed me to listen, to share what was weighing on their mind. We\u2019d promised to always talk things through, to never let concerns fester in silence. Just as they started to open up about a tough day at work, my phone vibrated again\u2014my friend, texting in confusion about where we were supposed to meet tonight. We\u2019d had a misunderstanding earlier, and I knew if I didn\u2019t clear it up now, it might spiral into something bigger. My spouse\u2019s voice trembled, and I could see how much they needed my full attention. But my friend was waiting, probably feeling anxious and left out. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which message to answer first, feeling the weight of both relationships pressing in on me, each expecting openness and support at the same moment."}
