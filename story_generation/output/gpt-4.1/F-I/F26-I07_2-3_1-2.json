My team was counting on me; this was the last chance to voice concerns before the project\u2019s direction was set in stone. I knew my input mattered, and I could already imagine the disappointment in my manager\u2019s voice if I missed it. Just then, my granddaughter shuffled into the room, her eyes red and shoulders slumped. She hesitated, hovering near the doorway, and I could sense she needed me\u2014needed the comfort and wisdom only a grandparent could offer. My heart ached to reach out, to listen and guide her through whatever was weighing her down. But the clock ticked closer to the meeting\u2019s start, and I felt the pressure mounting from both sides. I wanted to be present for my team, but I also wanted to be the steady presence my granddaughter needed right now. The demands pulled at me, and I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, unsure which to choose."}
