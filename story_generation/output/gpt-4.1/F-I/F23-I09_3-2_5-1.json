I baked a small cake, hoping to share it with the family next door. As I was about to step outside, I noticed my stepson, Jamie, slipping something into his pocket at the corner store across the street. My heart sank when I realized he had taken a pack of cookies without paying. As his step-parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to be firm and guide him toward honesty. But as I walked back, cake in hand, I saw my new neighbor waving from their porch, smiling warmly, ready to welcome us. I felt torn\u2014should I address Jamie\u2019s behavior immediately, risking a scene in front of the neighbors and possibly ruining our first impression? Or should I set the issue aside for now, greet the neighbors politely, and handle the discipline later? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I stood there, caught between the expectations of being a good step-parent and a friendly neighbor, unsure which path to take."}
