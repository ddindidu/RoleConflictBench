I knew how much this meant to her, to all of them\u2014keeping our traditions alive, showing respect for our heritage. But my phone buzzed again, another message from Mia. We\u2019d been arguing all week about money, about how I never seemed to have enough time for her, about how I always put my family first. She wanted to talk tonight, to finally resolve things, but tonight was the rehearsal for the ceremony. My chest tightened as I thought about letting my parents down, about Mia feeling like she didn\u2019t matter. I wanted to be the son my family needed, the boyfriend Mia deserved. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stared at my phone, torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
