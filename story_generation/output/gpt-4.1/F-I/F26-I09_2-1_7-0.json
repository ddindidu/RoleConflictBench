She was bubbling with excitement, and I could hear the pride in her voice as she described her first day. As her parent, I know how important it is to listen, to ask questions, to show her that I care about every detail. I promised her I\u2019d call back soon to hear more, and I meant it. But as I stepped out to take the trash, I ran into Mrs. Lee from next door. She smiled and greeted me warmly, expecting the usual friendly chat we share in the corridor. I could see she wanted to talk about her garden, maybe even invite me in for tea. I felt torn\u2014my mind was still with my daughter, wanting to be present for her, but I also didn\u2019t want to seem rude or distant to Mrs. Lee. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood there, caught between the warmth of family and the kindness of neighborly connection, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
