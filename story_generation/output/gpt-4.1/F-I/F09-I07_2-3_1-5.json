She\u2019s been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019ll be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But as I closed the email, my phone buzzed with a message from my manager: \u201cCan you confirm the client delivery will be ready by tomorrow afternoon?\u201d The task I\u2019m working on is the last piece before we can send everything to the client. If I don\u2019t finish it on time, the whole project will be delayed, and my team is counting on me. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my daughter\u2019s expectant face, my colleagues\u2019 trust. My heart aches as I try to figure out how I can possibly be in two places at once, knowing that no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
