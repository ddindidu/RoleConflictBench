It\u2019s important to your father and me.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation settle on my shoulders. I wanted to belong, to show I respected their traditions, even if they weren\u2019t mine by birth. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the project deadline was looming, and my mentor expected regular updates. The team was falling apart, arguments flaring up, and I knew I should reach out to my mentor, admit things weren\u2019t going well. But how could I explain that I might have to miss a crucial meeting because my family needed me? I felt torn, pulled between the desire to prove myself as a devoted step-child and the responsibility to be honest and proactive as a mentee. My chest tightened as I stared at the two calendars\u2014one marked with the family ceremony, the other with the project deadline\u2014wondering how I could possibly meet both expectations without letting someone down."}
