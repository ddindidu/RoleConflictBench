My husband called from the kitchen, asking if I could help him tidy up the living room before his parents arrived. The house was a mess\u2014dishes piled up, laundry half-folded, and the guest room still needed fresh sheets. I knew how important it was to him that everything looked perfect for his family, and I wanted to share the load, to be the supportive partner he expected.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from Priya, my mentee. She was struggling with her project deadline, her anxiety clear in her words. She needed me to review her latest draft and talk her through the next steps, just as I\u2019d promised during our last check-in. I could hear the urgency in her voice, the same urgency I felt from my husband\u2019s glance.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn between the kitchen and my phone, my heart racing as I tried to figure out how to be both the wife and the mentor everyone needed me to be, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
