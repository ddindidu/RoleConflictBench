I could almost hear her voice, hoping for reassurance, for me to ask if everything was okay at home. But my laptop screen glared back at me, the unfinished report blinking like an accusation. The deadline was tomorrow morning, and if I didn\u2019t finish, the next part of the project\u2014Sarah\u2019s section\u2014would be delayed, throwing off the whole team. I could already imagine the disappointment in my manager\u2019s eyes, the subtle frustration from my colleagues. My parents needed me to be present, to listen, to care. My team needed me to deliver, to be reliable. I sat there, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which expectation I could bear to let down."}
