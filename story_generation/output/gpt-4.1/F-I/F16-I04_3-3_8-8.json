I nodded, feeling the weight of their expectation\u2014no secrets, no half-truths, just us facing this together. But my phone buzzed, and I glanced down to see a message from my friend: \u201cCan we talk? I\u2019m really hurt by what you said earlier.\u201d My stomach twisted. I\u2019d made a careless joke, and now I could feel the distance growing between us. I knew I needed to call, to explain, to be vulnerable and honest\u2014just as my friend expected from me. But my spouse was waiting, needing my full attention and trust. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, each demanding openness, each deserving it, but knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
