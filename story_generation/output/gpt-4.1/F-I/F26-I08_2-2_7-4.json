She wanted to share every detail, and I could hear my grandson giggling in the background. I know how important it is to be present for my family, to listen and celebrate these milestones with them. They expect me to be involved, to call often, and to show I care. Just as I was about to settle in for a long chat, my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from Mark, an acquaintance from my book club. He was moving apartments today and needed help with a few heavy boxes. He rarely asks for favors, and I know he doesn\u2019t have many people to rely on. I could sense the urgency in his message. Now, I\u2019m torn. My family expects my attention and warmth, especially on a day like this, but Mark is counting on me, too. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I\u2019m not sure I can give at the same time. My heart aches as I sit, phone in hand, wrestling with what to do next."}
