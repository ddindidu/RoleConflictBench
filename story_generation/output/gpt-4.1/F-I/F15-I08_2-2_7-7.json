As a parent, I felt the constant pressure to ensure my family had enough for groceries, rent, and the kids\u2019 school supplies. Every dollar mattered, and I was always on the lookout for extra shifts or side jobs. Today, though, I was just trying to get through my lunch break when an acquaintance from work slid into the seat beside me. She leaned in, her voice low, and started criticizing a colleague\u2019s recent project, hinting that maybe I should mention it to our supervisor\u2014after all, there might be an opening for extra hours if the colleague was seen as unreliable.\n\nI felt a knot tighten in my stomach. On one hand, the thought of more hours meant more money for my family, a chance to breathe a little easier. On the other, I knew the expectation among acquaintances was to avoid gossip and not speak ill of others. I didn\u2019t want to betray that trust or my own sense of integrity. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I sat there, torn, unsure of what to say next."}
