We all need to be here for the family ritual.\u201d She looked at me with that hopeful, searching gaze, and I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation. This tradition mattered to her, and I wanted to show I belonged, that I respected what mattered to them. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I excused myself to check it. It was a message from Jamie, an acquaintance from school. \u201cHey, my car broke down on Old Pine Road. Can you help? No one else is picking up.\u201d I stared at the screen, heart pounding. Jamie had always been kind to me, and I knew how scary that road could be at night. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss the ritual, and my family would see it as a sign I didn\u2019t care. I felt torn, the pressure from both sides squeezing my chest. I wanted to be the reliable friend, but also the loyal step-child. My hands shook as I tried to decide what to do next."}
