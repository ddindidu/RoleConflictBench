The kids had soccer practice tomorrow, and my partner had an early meeting\u2014clean clothes were a must. As I loaded the washing machine, I heard a gentle knock at the door. Peeking through the window, I saw our new neighbors, smiling and holding a small cake, clearly hoping to introduce themselves. I remembered how important it was to be welcoming, especially since we\u2019d talked about building a friendly community. But the laundry couldn\u2019t wait, and I knew my spouse was counting on me to keep things running smoothly at home. My heart raced as I wiped my hands, torn between the warmth of a neighborly welcome and the pressing needs of my family. I hesitated at the door, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which role to honor first."}
