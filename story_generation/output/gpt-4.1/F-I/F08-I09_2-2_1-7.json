My granddaughter, Emma, had barely touched her dinner, her eyes clouded with something she wouldn\u2019t share. As her grandmother, I felt the urge to sit beside her, to offer the comfort and advice she might need, to remind her that storms\u2014inside and out\u2014always pass. But then my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Lee across the hall. She was anxious about the storm advisory, asking if I could check in on her later and maybe help bring in her mail. As her neighbor, I knew she depended on me for these small reassurances, especially with her children living far away. I felt torn, pulled by the need to be present for Emma, to gently coax her worries into the open, and the responsibility to look after Mrs. Lee, who might be frightened and alone tonight. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my care, and I sat there, heart tugged in two directions, unsure which door to open first."}
