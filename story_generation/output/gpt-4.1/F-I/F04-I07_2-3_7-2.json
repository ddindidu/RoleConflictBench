My younger brother had just texted, \u201cCan we talk? I really need you.\u201d We\u2019d argued last night\u2014he felt I never listened, that I dismissed his opinions. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be more patient, more understanding, to rebuild the respect between us. But as I typed a reply, my laptop chimed: \u201cFinal team meeting starts in 5 minutes.\u201d This was the last chance to voice concerns before our project\u2019s direction was set. My manager expected everyone\u2019s input, and missing it would let my team down. I stared at the screen, torn. My brother needed me to listen, to show I cared. My team needed me to show up, to contribute. Both roles demanded my presence, my attention, my respect. I felt the pressure mounting, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me as I weighed the expectations\u2014family or work, brother or colleague."}
