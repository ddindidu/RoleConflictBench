My husband had mentioned how much he appreciated having clean clothes ready for the kids\u2019 soccer game tomorrow, and I knew he was counting on me to get the laundry done tonight. Just as I was sorting the whites from the colors, my phone buzzed. It was Mia, my oldest friend, her message urgent: \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m totally lost with this bookshelf and the instructions make no sense.\u201d I could hear the frustration in her voice, and I remembered how she\u2019d been struggling since her move last week. She rarely asked for help, and I knew she needed me now. My hands hovered over the laundry, my mind torn between the promise I\u2019d made at home and the friend who was reaching out. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt my chest tighten as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
