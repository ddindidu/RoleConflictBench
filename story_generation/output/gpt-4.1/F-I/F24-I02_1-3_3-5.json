My mom\u2019s eyes sparkled, and my little stepsister bounced in her seat, already planning snacks. I knew how much it meant to them\u2014especially since I\u2019d missed the last few outings. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, and I glanced down at the message from Mia: \u201cCan\u2019t believe it\u2019s our last weekend together before I leave. Just want it to be us.\u201d My heart twisted. She\u2019d been counting down the days, and I\u2019d promised we\u2019d make every moment count. I could already hear her disappointment if I told her I had to spend the day with my family instead. But if I bailed on the hike, my mom would be hurt, and my stepsister would ask why I never wanted to join. I felt pulled in two directions, both sides expecting me to show up, to care, to choose them. My chest tightened as everyone looked at me, waiting for my answer."}
