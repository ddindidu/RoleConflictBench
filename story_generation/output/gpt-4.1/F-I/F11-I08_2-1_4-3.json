Mom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone\u2019s counting on you to help set up.\u201d As the eldest sister, I knew how much these gatherings meant, especially to her. I could already picture my younger siblings waiting for me, expecting me to bring my usual energy and jokes to the table.\n\nJust as I was about to leave work, my phone buzzed again. This time, it was Priya, an acquaintance from my yoga class. \u201cHey, sorry for the last-minute ask, but could you recommend a good restaurant nearby? My parents are visiting, and I want to impress them.\u201d I could sense the urgency in her message. She\u2019d always been kind to me, and I knew she didn\u2019t have many friends in the city.\n\nI stared at my phone, feeling the pressure build. If I stopped to help Priya, I\u2019d risk being late to the family dinner and disappointing everyone. But if I ignored her, I\u2019d feel guilty for not being there when she needed support. My mind raced, torn between being the reliable sister and the helpful acquaintance, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
