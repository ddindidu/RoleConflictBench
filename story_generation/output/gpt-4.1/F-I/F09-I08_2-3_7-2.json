As a mother, I knew I had to find a way to cover the rent and buy groceries for the week. My children depended on me, and the weight of that responsibility pressed heavily on my shoulders. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from an acquaintance, someone I\u2019d met at the community center. She was outside, asking if she could come in for a moment. When I opened the door, I saw her eyes red and swollen, tears streaming down her face. She began to sob, telling me about a recent loss, her words tumbling out in broken sentences. I could see she needed comfort, someone to listen, maybe even a cup of tea and a gentle hand. But inside, my mind was still tangled in worry about the bills and the urgent need to find extra work. I felt torn\u2014my heart wanted to be present and kind, but my mind screamed that I didn\u2019t have time or energy to spare. I stood there, caught between the demands of being a mother and the expectations of being a compassionate acquaintance, unsure of what to do next."}
