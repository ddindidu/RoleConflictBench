I remembered how Mom always said he\u2019d been stressed at work lately, and I felt that familiar tug of responsibility. I should ask him if he\u2019s okay, maybe offer to help or just talk. That\u2019s what a good step-child does, right? But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Jamie: \u201cUgh, today was endless. I need to vent. You there?\u201d Jamie always counted on me to listen, and I knew she\u2019d be hurt if I ignored her now. My stepdad glanced over, waiting for me to say something, and I could feel the weight of both their expectations pressing down on me. I wanted to be there for both of them, but I only had so much energy and attention to give. My thumb hovered over the phone, my words caught in my throat, torn between the two people who needed me in different ways at the exact same moment."}
