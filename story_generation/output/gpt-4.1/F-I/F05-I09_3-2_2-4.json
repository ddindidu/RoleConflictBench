She needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words, my presence. I wanted nothing more than to sit beside her, to reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone. But just as I reached for the door, our dog started barking furiously in the hallway. I winced, knowing how thin the walls were and how our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had already complained about the noise last week. I could almost hear her sigh of frustration through the wall. I felt torn\u2014my wife\u2019s pain was raw and immediate, but I also knew I was expected to keep the peace in our building, to be the kind of neighbor who respected shared spaces and boundaries.
