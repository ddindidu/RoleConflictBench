He looked at me, eyes searching for reassurance, and I knew he needed me to listen, to help him sort through his doubts and fears. He\u2019d been up all night, and I could feel the weight of his anxiety pressing between us. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, my phone buzzed. It was my friend, panicked, saying she was already halfway to the airport and thought she\u2019d left her passport at home. She begged me to check and, if it was there, to rush it to her before her flight. My husband squeezed my hand, his voice trembling as he asked, \u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d At the same time, my friend\u2019s desperation echoed in my ear. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014one by the man I promised to stand by, the other by a friend who needed me in a crisis. I could feel the pressure mounting, the expectations of both roles colliding inside me, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
