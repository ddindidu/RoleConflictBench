My little sister was already dressed up, excitedly talking about the games we\u2019d play after dinner. I knew how much these family gatherings meant to everyone, especially since we didn\u2019t get together often. Just as I was about to head upstairs to change, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my friend, Sam: \u201cHey, man. Rough day. Can I talk to you for a bit?\u201d I could almost hear the heaviness in his words. He\u2019d been having a tough time lately, and I knew he needed someone to listen. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected me to be present, cheerful, and involved, but Sam needed me too, maybe more than ever. My heart tugged in two directions, and I sat there, torn, unsure which role I should step into first."}
