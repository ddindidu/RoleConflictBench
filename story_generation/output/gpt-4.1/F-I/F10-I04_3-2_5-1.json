I knew how much this meant to her, to all of us\u2014keeping our traditions alive, showing respect for our heritage. I wanted to make her proud, to honor everything my family stood for.\n\nJust as I was rehearsing the opening lines, my phone buzzed. It was Mia, my closest friend. Her voice trembled, barely holding back tears. \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now,\u201d she whispered. I could hear the pain in her words, the kind that only a friend could help soothe.

I felt torn, the weight of tradition pressing on one side, the urgency of friendship on the other, unsure which part of me should answer first."}
