My parents had just asked me to lead the family ceremony this year, a role my grandfather had always filled. They looked at me with pride, expecting me to honor our traditions and show respect for our heritage. I felt the weight of their hopes, the importance of not letting them down.\n\nLater that evening, I found myself at a small gathering with some acquaintances. The conversation turned to a mutual colleague who had made some controversial decisions at work. The group leaned in, voices dropping, eager to dissect every detail. One of them turned to me, expecting me to join in, maybe even share something I\u2019d heard from my family about the colleague\u2019s background. I knew the group valued discretion and disliked gossip, but the pressure to fit in was strong.\n\nInside, I felt torn. My family wanted me to be a proud representative of our values, but here, my acquaintances expected me to be discreet and avoid negative talk. The two worlds collided in my mind, and I could feel the tension building as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
