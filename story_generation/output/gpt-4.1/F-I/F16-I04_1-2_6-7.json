My spouse was in the kitchen, telling me about a strange interaction with a coworker, their voice light but eyes searching for my attention. I nodded, trying to listen, but my mind was racing. My friend had just texted back, clearly upset by something I\u2019d said earlier. I could hear the hurt in their words, and I knew I needed to call and clear things up before it festered. But my spouse was opening up, something they didn\u2019t always do, and I knew how much it meant to them that I listened and responded with care. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my friend needed immediate reassurance, but my spouse needed me present, right here, right now. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on both, feeling the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which voice to answer first."}
