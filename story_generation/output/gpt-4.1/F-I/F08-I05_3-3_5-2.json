My daughter\u2019s voice trembled over the line, asking me to come over\u2014my grandson was sick, and she needed my help. I could hear the worry in her words, the unspoken plea for comfort and support only a grandmother could give. At the same time, my mentee, Sarah, was waiting for our scheduled video call. She was on the verge of accepting a job offer that would shape her entire career, and she needed my guidance to weigh the pros and cons, to help her see what she might be missing.
