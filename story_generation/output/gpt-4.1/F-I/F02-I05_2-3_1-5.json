She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the presentation, her eyes shining with anticipation every time she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Dad?\u201d I promised her I would. But as I was about to leave the office, my phone buzzed. One of my mentees, Ravi, was on the verge of making a crucial decision on a project that could either save or cost the company millions. He needed my guidance\u2014now. I could hear the anxiety in his voice, the weight of responsibility pressing on him. As a mentor, I knew how much he depended on me, how much my experience could help him avoid a disaster. But as a father, I also knew how much my presence meant to my daughter, how she\u2019d scan the crowd for my face. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between two worlds, knowing that whichever door I walked through, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
