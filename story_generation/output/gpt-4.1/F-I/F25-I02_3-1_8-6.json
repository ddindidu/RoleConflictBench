My mom\u2019s voice still echoed in my mind\u2014she\u2019d just confided in me about her fears of losing her job, her eyes searching mine for reassurance. I could see how much she needed me to be strong, to listen, to tell her everything would be okay. I wanted to be there for her, to offer the comfort she rarely asked for.\n\nBut my phone kept lighting up with messages from Mia. She was upset because I\u2019d forgotten to confirm our weekend plans, and now she thought I didn\u2019t care. I knew she expected me to call, to talk things through, to fix the tension before it grew. I could almost hear her voice, hurt and impatient, waiting for me to step up as her boyfriend.\n\nMy heart pounded as I looked between the closed door where my mom waited and the phone in my hand. Both needed me, both right now, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure which part of me to answer first."}
