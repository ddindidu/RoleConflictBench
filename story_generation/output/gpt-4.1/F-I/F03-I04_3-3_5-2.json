It was Sam, my closest friend. His voice trembled, barely holding together as he told me his father had just been rushed to the hospital. He needed me\u2014someone to listen, to help him make sense of the chaos. I could hear his pain, and every instinct told me to stay on the line, to be the friend he needed right now.\n\nBut in the next room, my parents were discussing the ceremony, reminding me how important it was for me to lead, to honor our family\u2019s traditions. They\u2019d been so proud when I agreed to take on this role, trusting me to carry forward what generations before us had cherished. I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing on me, the hope in their voices when they spoke about tomorrow.\n\nTorn between Sam\u2019s desperate need for comfort and my family\u2019s faith in me, I sat in the dark, phone in hand, heart pounding, not knowing which part of me to answer first."}
