As a step-parent, I felt the weight of ensuring our family\u2019s financial stability. Groceries, rent, school supplies\u2014every expense seemed to grow heavier each month. My partner trusted me to keep us afloat, and the kids looked to me for reassurance that everything would be okay. \n\nMy phone buzzed with a message from Jordan, my mentee at work. He\u2019d been missing deadlines, and during our last check-in, he admitted he was overwhelmed, struggling to balance his workload. As his mentor, I was expected to guide him, to encourage his growth and help him develop better time management skills. He needed more of my time, more support, and I wanted to be there for him.\n\nBut as I stared at the bills and reread Jordan\u2019s message, I felt torn. If I took on extra shifts to cover our expenses, I\u2019d have less time for mentoring. If I devoted more energy to Jordan, I risked letting my family down. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I sat there, heart pounding, unsure which role needed me more."}
