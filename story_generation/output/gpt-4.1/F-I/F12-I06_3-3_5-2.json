My husband called from the living room, asking if I could help him rearrange the furniture before his parents arrived tomorrow. The house had to be spotless\u2014every cushion fluffed, every surface gleaming. I knew how much it meant to him, to us, to make a good impression. But my phone buzzed again, a reminder of the unfinished report my mentor assigned me just hours ago. The deadline was non-negotiable; upper management would review it first thing in the morning. My mentor trusted me to deliver, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my husband\u2019s hopeful glances, the urgency in my mentor\u2019s last message. My mind raced, torn between the home I wanted to present and the professional promise I needed to keep. My heart pounded as I dried my hands, caught between the living room and my laptop, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
