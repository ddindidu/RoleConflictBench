My phone buzzes with a message from my younger sister: \u201cMovie night at my place? You promised!\u201d I know she\u2019s been feeling left out lately, and I\u2019ve been trying to build a better relationship with her, making sure she feels included in my life. At the same time, I glance down the hallway and remember Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor. The storm advisory on the news warned of possible power outages and delays, and she lives alone. I know she relies on neighbors for small things\u2014receiving her mail, checking in when the weather gets bad. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing on me: my sister\u2019s hope for a fun, normal evening together, and Mrs. Lee\u2019s unspoken need for reassurance and help. My mind races, torn between being the brother my sister needs and the neighbor Mrs. Lee depends on. The clock ticks, and I stand in the hallway, heart pounding, unsure which door to knock on first."}
