I know how much my spouse counts on me to share the load, to keep our little world running smoothly. But my phone buzzes with a reminder\u2014my mentor is expecting an update on my project by noon. I\u2019ve hit a technical wall, and I\u2019m supposed to reach out as soon as I encounter any roadblocks. That\u2019s what she emphasized: \u201cDon\u2019t let things pile up. Communicate early.\u201d My mind races, torn between the hum of the washing machine and the ping of my inbox. If I start the laundry now, I\u2019ll be late sending that email, risking my mentor\u2019s trust. If I write to her first, the laundry will be pushed back, and my spouse will be disappointed. My chest tightens as I stand in the hallway, paralyzed by the weight of both expectations, wishing I could split myself in two."}
