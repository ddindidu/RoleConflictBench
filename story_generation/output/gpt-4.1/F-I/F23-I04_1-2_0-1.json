It was important to me, showing up for them, especially since I wasn\u2019t their biological parent. I wanted them to know they could count on me. As I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed. It was Jamie, my closest friend. Her voice trembled, \u201cCan you talk? I really need you. It\u2019s about Mark\u2026 we had a huge fight.\u201d I could hear her trying not to cry. Jamie had always been there for me, and I knew how much she relied on me to listen, to be present when things got tough. My heart twisted. I wanted to be there for her, to give her the support she needed, but I also couldn\u2019t let the kids down. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, torn between two people who needed me in completely different ways, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
