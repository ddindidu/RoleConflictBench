It\u2019s important we keep our family traditions alive.\u201d She looked at me with that hopeful smile, the kind that made me feel like I was carrying the weight of generations. I nodded, promising I\u2019d be there, even though I knew what that meant.\n\nMy phone buzzed. It was Mia, my girlfriend. Her message was short, but I could sense the tension: \u201cCan we talk about this weekend? I thought we agreed to spend it together.\u201d We\u2019d had a small argument earlier about my family\u2019s sudden plans, and I knew she expected me to help smooth things over, to show her she mattered just as much.\n\nI stared at the screen, feeling pulled in two directions. My family wanted me to honor our customs, to be the good son who never missed a gathering. Mia needed me to be present, to resolve our disagreement and put our relationship first. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be both."}
