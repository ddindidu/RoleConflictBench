My husband called from the living room, asking if I could help him tidy up before his relatives arrived. The house was a mess, and we had agreed to split the chores, but it felt like everything was falling on me. At that moment, my phone buzzed on the counter. It was my friend, texting in confusion about where we were supposed to meet later. She sounded upset, and I knew I needed to clear things up right away before the misunderstanding grew. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. My husband\u2019s voice grew more insistent, reminding me that we still had to vacuum and set the table. My friend\u2019s messages kept coming, each one more anxious than the last. I felt torn, my loyalty stretched thin between being the supportive wife my husband expected and the reliable friend my friend needed. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, unsure which role to fulfill first."}
