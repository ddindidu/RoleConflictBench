Suddenly, he darted away, weaving between carts and giggling, ignoring my calls. I felt the familiar pressure to teach him discipline, to show him right from wrong, especially in public. Just as I was about to chase after him, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Lee, my neighbor, reminding me to check her apartment for any package deliveries since the power would be out for a few hours. She trusted me to help, and I knew how much she relied on neighbors for peace of mind while she was away. My heart pounded as I glanced between my son, now nearly out of sight, and my phone, feeling the weight of both responsibilities. Should I rush after my son and risk missing the delivery, or handle the neighbor\u2019s request and let my son\u2019s behavior slide for now? The expectations tugged at me from both sides, and I stood frozen, torn between being the mother my child needed and the neighbor Mrs. Lee counted on."}
