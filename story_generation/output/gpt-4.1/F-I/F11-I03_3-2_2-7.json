I really need you.\u201d He never asked for help unless things were bad, and I could hear the heaviness in his words. I knew I had to be there for him\u2014he\u2019d always been my rock, and now it was my turn to support him. But as I reached for my keys, my boyfriend called. His voice was tense, \u201cAre we going to talk about this or not? We can\u2019t keep ignoring our money problems.\u201d We\u2019d argued three times this week, and I knew he expected me to sit down and work things out, to show I cared enough to fix what was broken between us.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. My brother needed me now, but so did my boyfriend, in a different way. I felt the weight of both their expectations pressing on me, my heart pulled in two directions. I wanted to be the sister who always showed up, and the girlfriend who didn\u2019t run from hard conversations. But I couldn\u2019t be both at once. My hands shook as I tried to decide which door to walk through."}
