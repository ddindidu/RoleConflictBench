His face looked tired, older than usual. He started talking about how work had been overwhelming, how he felt like he was letting everyone down. I could hear the vulnerability in his voice, and I knew he wanted me to listen, to reassure him, maybe even to tell him he was doing okay. I felt the weight of his need for comfort settle on my shoulders.\n\nJust as I was about to respond, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Jamie, someone I\u2019d only met a few times at a friend\u2019s party. \u201cHey! You know any good places to eat around here? I\u2019m meeting someone and want to impress them.\u201d I stared at the screen, feeling the pressure to reply quickly and be helpful, not wanting to seem rude or uninterested.\n\nMy stepdad\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting. My phone vibrated again. I felt torn, caught between being the supportive step-child my family expected and the helpful acquaintance I wanted to be. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to do first."}
