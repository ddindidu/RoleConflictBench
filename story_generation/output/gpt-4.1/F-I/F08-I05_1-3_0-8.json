The project deadline moved up, and I\u2019m panicking.\u201d I glanced across the room at my granddaughter, who was nervously twisting a strand of hair. \u201cGrandma, how did you know what to do when everything in your life started changing?\u201d she asked, her eyes searching mine for reassurance. \n\nAs a grandmother, I wanted to wrap her in comfort, share stories of my own uncertain beginnings, and assure her that she\u2019d find her way. But as a mentor, I knew my mentee needed me to be present, to challenge her, to help her strategize and push through her fear. Both needed my wisdom, but in such different ways\u2014one gentle and nurturing, the other direct and motivating. \n\nMy heart tugged in two directions, the weight of their expectations pressing on me. I could hear the clock ticking, feel the urgency in both their voices, and I sat there, torn, unsure which call to answer first."}
