It\u2019s a tradition that\u2019s been passed down for generations, and I know how much it means to her\u2014and to everyone. I felt the weight of her expectations settle on my shoulders, the importance of honoring our family\u2019s values pressing in.\n\nBut as I nodded, my phone buzzed. A message from Mrs. Lee next door: \u201cCould you please receive my package today? I\u2019ll be at work and it\u2019s important.\u201d She\u2019s always been a kind neighbor, checking in on us during storms and sharing her garden\u2019s bounty. I know how much she relies on me for these small favors, and I don\u2019t want to let her down.\n\nNow, I sit by the window, torn. The ceremony and the delivery are both this afternoon. My heart aches as I imagine disappointing my mother or Mrs. Lee. I wish I could be in two places at once, but I can\u2019t. The clock ticks on, and I still haven\u2019t decided what to do."}
