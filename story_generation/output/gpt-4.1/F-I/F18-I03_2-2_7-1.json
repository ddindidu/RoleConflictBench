He caught my eye and grinned, but I could see the nervousness in his hands. I knew I should be right there, ready to stop him if things went wrong, to make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from Alex, my boyfriend. He\u2019d had a rough day at work, his boss tearing apart a project he\u2019d poured his heart into. He needed me, needed someone to listen, to reassure him that he wasn\u2019t a failure. I could almost hear his voice trembling through the screen. I felt torn in two, my brother\u2019s safety on one side, Alex\u2019s pain on the other. Both expected me to be there, to care, to help. My chest tightened as I tried to decide where I was needed most, feeling the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
