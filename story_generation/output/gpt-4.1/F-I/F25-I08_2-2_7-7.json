Mom barely touched her coffee, her eyes distant. I knew they needed me to be present, to offer comfort, maybe even just a smile or a gentle word. I wanted to help, to be the step-child who could ease their burdens, even a little. But my phone buzzed, and I glanced down to see a message from an acquaintance, inviting me to join a group chat. I hesitated, but joined anyway, hoping for a distraction. Almost immediately, someone made a snide remark about a colleague\u2019s recent project, criticizing their effort and results. The group laughed, expecting me to join in. I felt the pressure to fit in, to not be the odd one out, but I also remembered how much it hurt when people talked behind my parents\u2019 backs. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the urge to defend someone who wasn\u2019t there and the need to be accepted. Meanwhile, my parents\u2019 silence in the next room pressed on me, reminding me of the support they needed. I felt trapped, pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation to meet."}
