The numbers on the page didn\u2019t add up, and I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down\u2014rent, groceries, school supplies. I knew I had to find a way to make ends meet for the family, to be the reliable step-parent they needed. My phone buzzed. It was a message from Mark, my boyfriend. He was upset about our weekend plans falling through, wanting to talk and resolve things right away. I could hear the frustration in his words, the expectation that I\u2019d drop everything to fix our misunderstanding. My heart twisted. I wanted to be there for him, to show I cared, but the family\u2019s needs were immediate and urgent.
