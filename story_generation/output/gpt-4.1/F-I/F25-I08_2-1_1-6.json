They want to hear about my week, and I know it means a lot to them, especially since I moved out. Tonight, though, I\u2019m at a friend\u2019s place, and a few acquaintances are gathered around the kitchen table. The conversation turns to our mutual colleague, Jamie, and the choices she\u2019s made at work lately. The group is dissecting her decisions, some of them laughing, others shaking their heads. I feel the pressure to join in, to share what I know\u2014after all, I was just on the phone with my parents, and they\u2019d asked about my work life, including Jamie. I\u2019d told them everything, wanting to keep up the open communication they expect. Now, the group looks at me, waiting for my input. I know that if I say too much, I\u2019ll be gossiping, betraying the trust of both Jamie and my acquaintances. But if I stay silent, I risk seeming distant or unfriendly, and I can\u2019t help but wonder if I\u2019m letting my parents down by not being open with others, too. My phone buzzes with a message from my stepmom, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
