My younger brother was hunched over his textbooks across from me, his face pale and tense. He\u2019d barely slept, and I could see the anxiety in his eyes as he muttered formulas under his breath. I knew he needed me\u2014just to listen, to reassure him that he\u2019d be okay, that he was smart enough to get through this final exam. That\u2019s what siblings do, right? We\u2019re supposed to be there for each other, especially when things get tough.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again, this time with a message from my friend. She was already at the park, confused about where we were supposed to meet. We\u2019d had a misunderstanding earlier, and I knew if I didn\u2019t clear it up right now, she\u2019d feel let down or maybe even think I was ignoring her. Friends are supposed to communicate, to fix things before they get worse.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. My brother needed my attention, but so did my friend. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out who needed me more in this moment, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
