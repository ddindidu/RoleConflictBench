Can\u2019t wait to see you there!\u201d I smiled, feeling proud and excited for him. As his sister, I knew how much this day meant to him\u2014and to our whole family. We\u2019d always promised to show up for each other\u2019s big moments, and I wanted to be there, cheering him on as he walked across the stage.\n\nBut as I glanced at my work calendar, my heart sank. Our weekly team meeting was scheduled for the exact same time. My manager had emphasized the importance of everyone\u2019s presence, even though the meeting would be recorded for those who couldn\u2019t attend. I could already imagine the subtle disappointment in my colleagues\u2019 faces if I skipped out, especially since we were supposed to discuss a project I\u2019d been leading.\n\nI sat at my desk, torn between the expectation to support my brother and the responsibility to my team. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt the familiar ache of wanting to be in two places at once, knowing I could only choose one."}
