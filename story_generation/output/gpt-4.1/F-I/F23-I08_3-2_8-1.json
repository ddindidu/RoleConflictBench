As a step-parent, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest\u2014every dollar counted, and I needed to make sure we\u2019d be ready in two months. But tonight, I was just an acquaintance at a friend\u2019s gathering, expected to be warm and welcoming. Across the room, I noticed a new face, someone who looked lost and anxious, clutching a glass tightly. I knew I should go over, introduce myself, and help them feel at ease. That\u2019s what a good acquaintance would do. But my thoughts kept circling back to the bills, the budget spreadsheets, and the sacrifices ahead. I felt my smile falter, torn between the urge to retreat and plan, and the social expectation to reach out and be present. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
