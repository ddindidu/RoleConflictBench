My husband sat across from me, his brow furrowed, waiting for me to continue our conversation about the medical bills piling up on the counter. He wanted honesty, openness\u2014he needed to know how I really felt about dipping into our savings. I could see the worry in his eyes, the silent plea for reassurance and partnership. But my laptop was open, notifications popping up as my colleagues prepared for our weekly catch-up. I knew the meeting would be recorded, but I also knew my manager expected me to be present, to contribute, to show I was engaged. My heart pounded as I glanced between my husband and the screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be the supportive wife he needed, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my team down. The clock ticked closer to the meeting time, and I felt myself torn, wishing I could be fully present in both places at once."}
