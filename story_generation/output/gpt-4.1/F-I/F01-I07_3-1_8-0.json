My daughter\u2019s message was brief but heavy: my grandson was in trouble, and she needed me. As a grandfather, I\u2019ve always promised to be there, to listen, to help my family through anything. I could picture my grandson\u2019s anxious face, and my heart ached to call immediately, to offer comfort and advice.\n\nBut my computer screen flashed a reminder\u2014our weekly team meeting was about to start. As a colleague, I\u2019m expected to show up, contribute, and support my team. Even though the meeting would be recorded, I knew my absence would be noticed, and I didn\u2019t want to let my coworkers down or seem unreliable.\n\nI stared at the phone, then at the meeting invite, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed me now, but so did my team. The minutes ticked by, and I felt torn, caught between the urgent pull of family and the steady expectations of work, unsure which role to answer first."}
