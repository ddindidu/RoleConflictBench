My family had been talking a lot lately about how important it was to keep our traditions alive\u2014showing respect, never raising our voices, and always standing up for each other. But as I approached Mrs. Lee, I remembered the noise complaint that had been going around. She looked at me with a tight smile, and I could feel the tension in the air. I knew my parents expected me to defend our family if she brought up the complaint, to not let anyone speak badly about us. At the same time, I was supposed to be a good neighbor\u2014polite, friendly, and understanding. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the weight of my family\u2019s expectations with the need to be courteous. I could almost hear my parents\u2019 voices in my head, urging me to stand firm, while another part of me wanted to smooth things over and keep the peace. I opened my mouth, unsure which words would come out first."}
