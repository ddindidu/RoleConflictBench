She\u2019s been looking forward to this all week, and so have I. But across from me, my wife, Anna, is waiting for me to finish the conversation we started about our finances. She wants honesty, clarity, and my full attention. I see the worry in her eyes; she needs me to be present, to talk through the numbers and our plans for the future. \n\nBut my mind keeps drifting to Mia, who expects laughter, warmth, and a break from the stress of our daily routines. I promised her this night, just as I promised Anna my openness. The clock ticks, and I feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. I want to be the reliable husband Anna needs, but I also crave the escape and affection Mia offers. My heart pounds as I try to decide where I belong tonight, torn between two worlds that demand all of me."}
