The deadline was tight\u2014just three days\u2014and I knew how much my mentor valued diligence and follow-through. Every time I\u2019d met with her, she\u2019d emphasized the importance of meeting deadlines and showing initiative. I wanted to prove myself, to show her I was serious about this opportunity.\n\nMy phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen. It was Sunday evening\u2014time for my weekly call with my parents. I could already imagine my mom\u2019s gentle voice, asking about my week, and my dad\u2019s quiet questions about whether I was eating well. They looked forward to these calls, and so did I, usually. It was our way of staying close, even though I lived hours away. I knew they\u2019d worry if I skipped it, maybe even feel hurt.\n\nBut the code wasn\u2019t going to write itself, and every minute spent on the phone was a minute lost. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations: a devoted daughter, a committed mentee. I stared at my phone, torn, the cursor blinking accusingly on the screen."}
