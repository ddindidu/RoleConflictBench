My stepdad sat across from me, his hands wrapped around a mug, eyes tired. He started talking about how overwhelmed he felt at work, how he worried he wasn\u2019t doing enough for our family. I could see he needed me to listen, to reassure him, to be present. But as he spoke, my phone buzzed again\u2014another email from my manager, marked urgent. Leadership needed my confirmation on a project detail for an external partner, and the deadline was in less than an hour. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides: my stepdad\u2019s vulnerability pulling me to stay, to offer comfort, and my team\u2019s expectation that I\u2019d be responsive and reliable.
