My daughter had already called twice, gently reminding me how much the grandkids looked forward to our annual board game marathon. I could almost hear their laughter echoing through the house. At the same time, my mentee, Sarah, was in the thick of her first major project at work. She\u2019d scheduled a crucial check-in for the same weekend, needing my guidance to navigate a tricky client presentation. I knew how much she depended on my feedback\u2014her anxious late-night emails made that clear. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of family tradition, the responsibility of mentorship. Both sides expected my presence, my attention, my care. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the weight of letting someone down no matter which path I chose."}
