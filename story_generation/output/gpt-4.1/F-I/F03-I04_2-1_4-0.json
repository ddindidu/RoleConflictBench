My parents had been talking all week about how important it was to keep our family traditions alive, especially now that my grandparents were getting older. Tonight, they wanted everyone to share stories from our childhood, just like we always did on special occasions. I could see how much it meant to them, and I knew they expected me to be fully present, listening and participating.\n\nJust as my father began his story, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my friend, Sam: \u201cHey, can you talk? Had a rough day. Just need someone to listen.\u201d I knew Sam had been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised to be there whenever he needed support. My heart twisted as I glanced at my family, laughing and waiting for me to join in, while my phone vibrated again with another message from Sam. I felt torn, caught between honoring my family\u2019s wishes and being the friend Sam needed right now. My mind raced, unsure which role I should fulfill in this moment."}
