It means a lot to your sister.\u201d I could already picture the table, everyone laughing, my sister\u2019s proud smile as she showed off her new job. I knew how much these moments mattered to my family, how much they expected me to be present, to share in their joy and support.\n\nBut then I glanced at the couch, where my girlfriend sat, eyes red and shoulders slumped.

She needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to reassure her, to just be there. I could feel her disappointment, her silent plea for comfort.\n\nMy chest tightened as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the ache of my girlfriend\u2019s pain.
