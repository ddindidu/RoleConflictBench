My little brother\u2019s eyes lit up as he suggested a movie marathon, and my mom smiled, asking if I\u2019d be there this time. I knew how much it meant to them when I joined in, especially since I\u2019d missed the last few family nights. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from Jamie, my girlfriend. She reminded me that Saturday was our only free evening together before I left for a week-long work trip. She wanted to cook dinner together, just the two of us, and I could almost hear the hope in her words. My chest tightened as I looked from my family\u2019s expectant faces to the glowing screen. I wanted to be there for both, but I could already feel the disappointment that would come from whichever side I let down. The weight of their expectations pressed on me, and I wished I could split myself in two."}
