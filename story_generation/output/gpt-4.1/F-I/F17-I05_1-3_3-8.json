My family\u2019s laughter echoed from the living room, and I knew they expected me to join the annual storytelling tradition soon. It was a ritual that meant everything to them\u2014a way to honor our roots and keep our values alive. But my phone buzzed again, a message from my mentee, desperate for advice before tomorrow\u2019s big presentation. She was on the verge of a breakthrough, and I\u2019d promised to help her prepare, to be the mentor she needed at this critical moment. My heart twisted as I glanced between the closed door and my glowing screen. I wanted to be the child my family cherished, present and engaged, but I also wanted to be the mentor who never let her mentee down. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between honoring my family\u2019s traditions and supporting someone who was counting on me to help shape her future."}
