Our argument from last night still hung heavy in the air\u2014she wanted answers, resolution, some sign that I was willing to fight for us. But across from me, my wife, Anna, looked up from her coffee, her eyes clouded with worry. She\u2019d been quiet all morning, and I knew she needed me to ask, to listen, to be the partner she could lean on. I wanted to reach out, to comfort her, to share my own tangled thoughts, but my mind kept drifting to Mia\u2019s words: \u201cAre we even worth it anymore?\u201d Anna\u2019s expectation was for me to be present, to communicate openly, but Mia needed me to resolve our conflict, to prove I cared. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, my heart pulled in two directions. I could feel the tension building, my own needs lost somewhere between the demands of being a good spouse and a committed boyfriend. I stared at my phone, then at Anna, paralyzed by the impossible choice before me."}
