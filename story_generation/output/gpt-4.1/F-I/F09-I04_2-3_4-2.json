I felt the familiar pressure to teach him right from wrong, to be the mother who calmly but firmly corrects her child, showing him how to behave in public. As I reached for his hand, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was my best friend, calling at this late hour\u2014something must be wrong. I answered, and her sobs filled my ear; she could barely speak, her world unraveling from some terrible news. She needed me to listen, to be present, to offer comfort and support. But my son was still running wild, drawing annoyed glances from other shoppers. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014one part desperate to be the mother my child needed in that moment, the other aching to be the friend my friend needed, right now. I stood there, phone pressed to my ear, my son\u2019s laughter echoing, my friend\u2019s tears heavy in my heart, not knowing which role to choose."}
