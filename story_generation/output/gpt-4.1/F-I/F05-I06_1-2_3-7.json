I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d I knew she was right; I\u2019d been letting things slide, and sharing the load was part of being a good partner. Just as I reached for the first towel, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my mentor: \u201cI have 20 minutes free now\u2014can you hop on a call?\u201d My heart raced. He rarely had time, and I\u2019d been waiting all week for his feedback. I glanced at the laundry, then at my phone, torn between the promise I\u2019d made at home and the respect I owed my mentor. Both roles demanded my presence, both expectations felt urgent, and I could feel the tension knotting in my chest as I stood frozen, unable to move in either direction."}
