My mentee was struggling, and with the project deadline looming, I knew I had to be thorough\u2014share every trick, every lesson I\u2019d learned. I was deep in outlining the session when my wife came in, setting her bag down with a sigh. She started telling me about her day, something about a difficult meeting and a new project. I nodded, half-listening, my mind still on the session plan. She paused, waiting for me to respond, maybe to ask a question or just show I was really there with her. I felt the weight of her expectation\u2014she wanted me to listen, to communicate, to be present. But the clock was ticking, and my mentee was counting on me to deliver tomorrow. I felt torn, pulled between being the attentive husband she deserved and the dedicated mentor I promised to be. My heart raced as I tried to decide which role needed me more in that moment."}
