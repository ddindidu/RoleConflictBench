I knew something had happened at school\u2014he barely looked at me before heading to his room. As his step-sibling, I felt the pull to follow, to sit with him and listen, to be the support he needed. But just as I took a step toward his door, my phone buzzed. The neighbor group chat was lighting up about the noise complaint from last night\u2019s movie marathon. I remembered the meeting in the lobby was starting in five minutes, and as a neighbor, I was expected to show up, be polite, and help smooth things over. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between comforting my stepbrother and fulfilling my neighborly duty. I could hear him sniffling behind his door, but I also pictured the disappointed faces downstairs if I didn\u2019t show. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between the two worlds I was supposed to belong to."}
