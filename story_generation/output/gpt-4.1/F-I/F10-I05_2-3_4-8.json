It\u2019s your turn to show respect for our traditions.\u201d The weight of her expectation pressed on me, a reminder of how much our customs meant to everyone. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from Maya, my mentee. She was anxious about her upcoming presentation, the one that could open doors for her career. She needed my guidance, my encouragement to take bold steps and perhaps challenge the very norms I was being asked to uphold at home.\n\nAs I listened to my family discuss the importance of tradition, I felt torn. They wanted me to honor our past, to be the daughter who kept our values alive. But Maya needed me to be the mentor who championed growth and change, even if it meant questioning old ways. My heart ached with the tension between these worlds, each demanding a different version of me. I stared at my phone, then at my family, feeling the pull from both sides, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
