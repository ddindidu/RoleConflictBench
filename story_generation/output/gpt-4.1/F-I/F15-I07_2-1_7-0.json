I knew the meeting was just a routine catch-up, and it would be recorded, but I also knew my manager expected everyone to be present and engaged. At the same time, my partner had just texted me: \u201cWe\u2019re out of groceries. Can you pick up some things before the store closes? We really need milk and bread for tomorrow.\u201d Money was tight this month, and I\u2019d been picking up extra shifts and watching every dollar. If I left now, I could make it to the store before closing, ensuring my kids had breakfast in the morning. But if I skipped the meeting, would my colleagues think I wasn\u2019t committed? Would my boss notice my absence and question my dedication? I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family\u2019s needs on one side, my professional responsibilities on the other. My mind raced, torn between being the reliable parent my family depended on and the dependable colleague my team expected."}
