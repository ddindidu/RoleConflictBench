My partner greeted me with a tired smile and mentioned, almost in passing, that work had been a bit stressful. I could sense the need for comfort in their voice, the unspoken hope that I\u2019d listen and offer support. Just as I was about to sit down beside them, there was a knock at the door. It was Mrs. Lee from next door, holding a package that had been delivered to her by mistake. She smiled warmly, expecting the usual friendly chat we shared in the corridor. I felt the pull in two directions\u2014my partner\u2019s quiet need for reassurance, and my neighbor\u2019s expectation of a pleasant, polite exchange. My mind raced, torn between closing the door quickly to return to my partner, or lingering to maintain the friendly rapport with Mrs. Lee. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and for a moment, I stood frozen, unsure which role to fulfill first."}
