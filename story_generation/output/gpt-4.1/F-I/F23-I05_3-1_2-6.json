As a step-parent, I knew I was expected to show up for every school event, to be present and supportive. But now, the principal wanted to meet because my stepson had been caught bullying a classmate. I could already hear my partner\u2019s voice in my head, urging me to handle it with care, to be the adult who guides and protects.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my mentee, apologizing for missing another deadline. As a mentor, I was supposed to encourage growth, to help them develop better habits and confidence. I\u2019d promised to check in today, to offer advice and support, but my mind was tangled with worry about my stepson. How could I be fully present for my mentee when my family needed me? How could I guide my stepson through this mistake while still being the reliable mentor my mentee counted on? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stared at my phone, torn between two people who needed me in different ways."}
