She needed me\u2014really needed me\u2014to be present, to listen, to hold her hand through the storm of her personal crisis. I could see the exhaustion in her eyes, the silent plea for comfort. My phone buzzed on the nightstand. It was a message from Jamie, the intern I\u2019d been mentoring. She was anxious about a job offer and wanted my advice before the deadline tonight. I knew she depended on my guidance, even if it was usually just the occasional nudge in the right direction. My wife\u2019s hand tightened around mine, grounding me in the moment, but my mind raced. How could I be the anchor my wife needed and also the mentor Jamie expected? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my time, my care, my presence\u2014right now. I stared at the phone, heart pounding, torn between the two people counting on me, unsure which need to answer first."}
