It was almost three, and I had promised to pick up Mia and Lucas from school today. As their step-parent, I knew how much it meant to them that I showed up, especially with the end of the school year approaching. They\u2019d been talking about their art projects and the awards ceremony all week. I didn\u2019t want to let them down.\n\nJust as I was packing up, my phone buzzed. It was Sam, my mentee, with a string of questions about the new project. He\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d always prided myself on being available, sharing what I\u2019d learned, and guiding him through rough patches. He sounded anxious, and I could tell he needed more than a quick answer.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. If I left now, I\u2019d be there for the kids, but Sam would feel abandoned. If I stayed to help Sam, I\u2019d be late for Mia and Lucas, and I could already picture their disappointed faces. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which role needed me more in this moment."}
