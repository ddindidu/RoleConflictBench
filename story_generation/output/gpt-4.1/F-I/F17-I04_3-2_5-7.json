They looked at me with pride, expecting me to lead the family ceremony tonight, just as my older siblings had done before me. This was important to them\u2014an unbroken tradition, a symbol of our family\u2019s unity and respect for our heritage. I wanted to make them proud, to show I valued what mattered to them.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again. It was my best friend, Mia. Her last message was short and cold, a clear sign she was upset. She\u2019d misunderstood my earlier text, thinking I was annoyed with her, and now she was hurt. I knew I needed to call her right away, to explain and fix things before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014we talk things out, honestly and quickly.\n\nI stared at the phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family\u2019s expectant eyes, the script in my lap, and Mia\u2019s hurt in my pocket. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be both the child my parents needed and the friend Mia deserved, all at the same time."}
