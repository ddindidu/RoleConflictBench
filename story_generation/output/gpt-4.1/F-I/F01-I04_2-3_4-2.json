She wanted everyone together for breakfast, and I could see the excitement in her eyes. As a grandfather, I knew how much these moments meant\u2014being present, listening, and celebrating milestones together. I promised her I\u2019d be there, eager to see what she had to say.\n\nBut just as I was heading to bed, my phone buzzed. It was my old friend, Tom, calling in the middle of the night. His voice was shaky, and between sobs, he told me his brother had passed away unexpectedly. He needed someone to talk to, someone to just listen. I could hear the pain in his voice, and I knew how much he relied on me for support during times like this.\n\nLying there in the dark, phone pressed to my ear, I felt torn. My family expected me to be present and joyful in the morning, but my friend needed me now, in his darkest hour. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I wrestled with what to do next."}
