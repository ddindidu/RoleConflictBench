My stepmother had just finished reminding me, for the third time this week, how important it was to uphold our family\u2019s traditions\u2014especially now, with the holidays approaching. She wanted everything to be perfect, just like it always was in her family before I joined. That meant no disruptions, no complaints from neighbors, and certainly no barking dogs echoing through the building.\n\nBut as I tried to quietly guide my dog past the shared door, he started barking at the neighbor coming up the stairs. I saw the neighbor\u2019s frown, and I knew she expected me to keep the noise down, to respect the peace we all shared. My stepmother\u2019s words echoed in my mind, and I felt the weight of her expectations pressing on me. I wanted to be the stepchild who fit in, who didn\u2019t cause trouble, but I was also the neighbor who needed to be considerate. My heart pounded as I tried to calm my dog, caught between the demands of my family and the unspoken rules of the building, unsure which role I could fulfill without letting someone down."}
