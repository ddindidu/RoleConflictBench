My stepmom smiled at me, her eyes hopeful, and I knew she wanted me to chime in, to show I was part of the family. I tried to focus, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a call from my best friend, Mia. I slipped away to answer, and her voice was shaky, barely holding back sobs. She\u2019d just gotten terrible news about her dad, and she needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to just be there. I could hear my stepbrother calling me back to the living room, asking which plan I liked best. My stepmom\u2019s voice followed, gentle but expectant. I stood in the hallway, phone pressed to my ear, torn between the warmth of my new family and the pain in my friend\u2019s voice, feeling the weight of both worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
