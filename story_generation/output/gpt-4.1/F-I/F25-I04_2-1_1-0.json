He liked to hear about my week, and I knew it meant a lot to him that I kept up the tradition. I was just about to dial his number when my phone buzzed\u2014a text from Jamie. \u201cUgh, today sucked. Can I vent?\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words. Jamie had been having a rough time lately, and I\u2019d promised to be there for her, to listen when she needed it. But my stepdad was waiting, probably already glancing at the clock, expecting my call. I stared at my phone, feeling the pressure build in my chest. If I called my stepdad, Jamie might feel ignored when she needed me most. If I texted Jamie, I\u2019d be letting down my stepdad, who counted on these calls to feel connected. My thumb hovered over the screen, torn between two people who both needed me in different ways, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
