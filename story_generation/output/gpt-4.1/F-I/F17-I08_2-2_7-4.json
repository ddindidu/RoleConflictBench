Their voices were softer at dinner, and I caught them exchanging tired glances when they thought I wasn\u2019t looking. I felt this urge to stay home, to be present, to offer comfort\u2014maybe just by sitting with them or making tea, anything to lighten their load. But then, my phone buzzed. It was Sam, an acquaintance from class, asking if I could help move some boxes to his new apartment. He said he didn\u2019t have anyone else to ask, and I could hear the anxiety in his message. I knew how hard it was to reach out for help, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, heart pounding. I wanted to be the supportive child my parents needed, but I also didn\u2019t want to disappoint Sam when he was counting on me. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, unsure which way to turn."}
