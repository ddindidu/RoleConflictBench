We agreed I\u2019d handle the laundry today so everyone would have clean clothes for the weekend. I could almost hear her voice, gentle but firm, reminding me how much she appreciates when I share the load at home. But just as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my mentee, Sarah. She sounded anxious\u2014her big interview was tomorrow, and she needed my advice to calm her nerves and polish her presentation. As her mentor, I knew how much she depended on me, especially now, when a few words of encouragement could make all the difference in her career. I stood in the hallway, torn between the hum of the washing machine and the urgent ping of my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. My family needed me here, present and helpful. But Sarah needed me too, and I didn\u2019t want to let either of them down."}
