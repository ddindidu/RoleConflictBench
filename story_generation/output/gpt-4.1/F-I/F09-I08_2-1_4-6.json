I knew I needed to teach him about behaving properly in public, about respecting others\u2019 space and listening when I called his name. My heart pounded with the pressure to be a good mother, to correct him gently but firmly, to show him right from wrong. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a group of acquaintances, inviting me to join them for coffee right after shopping. When I arrived, the conversation quickly turned to a mutual colleague\u2019s recent decisions at work. I felt the expectation to join in, to nod along or add my own thoughts, but I remembered my own values\u2014how I always told my son not to speak badly about others. The demands pressed in from both sides: to discipline my child in the store, to fit in with the group without betraying my principles. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between the mother I wanted to be and the acquaintance everyone expected."}
