I knew they expected me to join in, to be present, to help knit us closer as a family. But my phone buzzed with a message from Maya, my mentee, who was anxious about her big interview on Monday. She wanted to meet this weekend for a mock interview and some last-minute advice. As a mentor, I felt responsible for her growth, for being the steady hand she needed right now. My stepmother looked at me, hopeful, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right?\u201d I nodded, but my mind raced. If I chose family, I\u2019d let Maya down at a crucial moment. If I chose Maya, I\u2019d miss another chance to bond with my new family. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
