My family was excitedly planning our annual holiday trip, and my mom looked at me expectantly, waiting for my input. As the oldest brother, I knew how much it meant to everyone that I be there, joining in the laughter and helping organize the details. Just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from an acquaintance in our group chat. She was venting about a colleague\u2019s recent mistakes at work, and I could see the conversation turning into a pile-on. I felt a knot in my stomach. I didn\u2019t want to ignore my family, but I also didn\u2019t want to be complicit in gossip by staying silent. My family expected my full attention and participation, but my conscience nagged at me to step in and steer the chat away from negativity. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides, each demanding something different from me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
