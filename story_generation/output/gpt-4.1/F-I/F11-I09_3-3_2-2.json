I glanced up and saw Mrs. Patel, my neighbor from across the hall, walking toward me with a tight smile. I knew why\u2014there had been a noise complaint about our apartment, and I could feel the tension in the air. As a sister, I wanted nothing more than to stay on the line, to reassure my brother that I was there for him, that he could lean on me. But as a neighbor, I was expected to be polite, to address the complaint with understanding and friendliness, to not let personal matters spill into our shared space. My brother\u2019s voice trembled in my ear, asking if I was still there, while Mrs. Patel waited expectantly, her eyes kind but firm. I felt pulled in two directions, my heart pounding as I tried to figure out how to be the sister he needed and the neighbor she expected\u2014all at the same time."}
