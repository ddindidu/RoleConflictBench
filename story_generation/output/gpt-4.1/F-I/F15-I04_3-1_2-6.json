The principal\u2019s words still echoed in my mind: my son had been caught bullying another child. As a parent, I knew I needed to go inside, face the teachers, and talk to my son about what happened. I could already picture his anxious face, waiting for me to show up and help him through this mess. But just as I was about to step out, my phone vibrated again\u2014a message from my friend, who was waiting for me at the caf\u00e9 across town. She sounded confused, unsure if we were still meeting or if she was even at the right place. We\u2019d had a misunderstanding last week, and I\u2019d promised to clear things up today. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My child needed me to be present and responsible, but my friend needed honesty and reassurance. My fingers hovered over my phone, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first."}
