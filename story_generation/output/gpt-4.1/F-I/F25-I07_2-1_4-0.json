Tonight was the annual family dinner, a tradition my stepmother insisted we all attend, especially this year. \u201cIt\u2019s important to show we\u2019re united,\u201d she\u2019d said, her eyes lingering on me a little longer than the others. I knew what she meant\u2014being the step-child, I always felt I had to prove I belonged, to honor their customs as if they were my own.\n\nBut at the same time, my work chat pinged. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the team meeting at 7,\u201d my manager wrote. \u201cWe\u2019d love your input.\u201d I was new to the team, eager to show I was committed, not just another face on the screen. The meeting would be recorded, but I knew being there live mattered\u2014my absence would be noticed.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting, my chest tightening. If I missed the dinner, I\u2019d disappoint my family, maybe confirm their doubts about my place. If I skipped the meeting, I\u2019d risk my standing at work. Both sides expected me to show up, to prove myself. I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, unsure which one I\u2019d let down."}
