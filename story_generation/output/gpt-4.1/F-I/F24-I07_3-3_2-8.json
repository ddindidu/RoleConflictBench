I glanced at the screen\u2014leadership needed a confirmation for tomorrow\u2019s meeting with our external partner, and they wanted a reply within the hour. I started typing a response, but then I heard muffled sobs from the living room. My stepbrother, Alex, had just come home from the hospital, his face pale and eyes red. He\u2019d gotten the news about his diagnosis, and I knew he needed me. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, especially when things got hard. But the email notification blinked insistently at the top of my screen, reminding me of my responsibility to the team. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between sitting with Alex and offering comfort, or finishing my reply before the deadline slipped by. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, each demanding my full attention, and I didn\u2019t know which way to turn."}
