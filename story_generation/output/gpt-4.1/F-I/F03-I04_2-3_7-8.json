Lately, they seemed to carry the weight of the world on their shoulders, and I knew they needed me to be present, to listen, to offer comfort. I sat down, ready to ask how they were doing, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my friend, short and cold. My heart sank as I remembered the careless comment I\u2019d made earlier, the one that clearly hurt them more than I realized. I knew I had to call and apologize, to explain myself and fix what I\u2019d broken between us. But as I looked at my parents, I could feel their silent plea for support. I was torn, caught between the urge to be the son they needed and the friend I wanted to be. My chest tightened with guilt and anxiety, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting for me."}
