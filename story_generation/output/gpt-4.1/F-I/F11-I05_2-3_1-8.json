I really need to talk.\u201d He never asked for help unless it was serious. I glanced at the clock\u2014just an hour before my scheduled video call with Maya, my mentee, who was about to present her first big project to the board. She\u2019d been anxious all week, and I\u2019d promised to be there, to coach her through her nerves and help her shine. \n\nAs a sister, I felt the pull to drop everything and rush to my brother\u2019s side, to listen and reassure him like I always had. But as a mentor, I knew Maya was counting on me to guide her, to help her grow and seize this opportunity. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my brother\u2019s need for comfort, Maya\u2019s need for confidence. I stared at my phone, torn between the two people who needed me most, feeling the pressure of being both a supportive sister and a dedicated mentor."}
