She\u2019s been acting strange, and people are saying things about her. Should I believe them?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling. I knew she needed my guidance, the kind only a grandmother could give\u2014honest, caring, and shaped by years of experience. I wanted to help her see the value of kindness and understanding, to offer wisdom she could carry with her.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Linda, an acquaintance from my book club. She wrote, \u201cDid you hear about what happened with Sarah at work? Her last project was a disaster. I can\u2019t believe she still has her job.\u201d I felt a familiar discomfort. As an acquaintance, I was expected not to engage in gossip or speak ill of others, to keep things light and neutral.\n\nMy granddaughter waited for my answer, her trust in me clear. At the same time, Linda\u2019s message lingered, tempting me to join in the conversation. I felt torn, caught between offering honest advice to my granddaughter and upholding my values as an acquaintance. My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to say next."}
