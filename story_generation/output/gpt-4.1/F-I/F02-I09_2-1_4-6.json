I know I should call him back, remind him about respecting others and behaving properly in public\u2014this is one of those moments where I need to teach him discipline, to be the father he needs. But my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from Mrs. Lee next door: \u201cCould you please watch for my package this afternoon? I\u2019m at work and it\u2019s important.\u201d I promised her I\u2019d be home, that I\u2019d help out, like good neighbors do. Now, I\u2019m torn. If I stop to discipline my son, we\u2019ll be delayed, and I might miss the delivery. If I rush through the store, I\u2019m letting this moment slip by, failing to teach him what\u2019s right. My mind races, guilt tugging from both sides\u2014my son\u2019s wild laughter echoing in one ear, Mrs. Lee\u2019s trust in the other. I grip the cart tighter, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
