The house was a whirlwind of activity\u2014relatives would arrive in just a few hours, and every surface needed to shine. She glanced at me, her eyes silently urging me to keep up, to not let her down. I knew how much this meant to her, to us, to present a united, capable front.\n\nMy phone buzzed on the counter. A message from my friend flashed on the screen, short and cold. My heart sank. I\u2019d made a careless joke last night, and only now realized how much it stung him. He deserved a call, an honest apology, right now before the hurt grew deeper. But the pile of chores loomed, and my wife\u2019s expectation pressed on me just as heavily. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me from both sides, paralyzed between the demands of being a good husband and a good friend, unsure which role to answer first."}
