As a father, I felt the weight of every dollar\u2014my family needed groceries, the rent was due, and the kids\u2019 school fees loomed. I had just picked up an extra shift at work to make ends meet, knowing it meant less time at home but more money for our daily needs. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was Mrs. Lee from next door, reminding me she\u2019d be away for a week and asking if I could keep an eye out for her packages, especially with the planned power outage. She sounded anxious, and I knew she had no one else to rely on. As her neighbor, I wanted to help, to be the dependable person she could trust. But the extra shift overlapped with the outage, and I wouldn\u2019t be home to check on her deliveries. My chest tightened as I weighed my family\u2019s needs against my promise to Mrs. Lee, torn between being the provider my family depended on and the neighbor I wanted to be."}
