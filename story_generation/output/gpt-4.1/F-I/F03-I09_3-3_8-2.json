Her eyes were red, and Dad sat beside her, silent but tense. She started talking about how overwhelmed she felt lately, how the house felt emptier since my sister moved out, and how she missed the old days. Dad squeezed her hand, and I could see he needed me to say something comforting, to be the strong, understanding son they could lean on. My heart ached for them, and I wanted to stay, to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay.\n\nBut my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the meeting in the lobby. Our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had asked me to join because of the noise complaint that had everyone on edge. I knew I was expected to be calm, friendly, and polite, to help smooth things over and keep the peace. I could already picture Mrs. Lee\u2019s anxious face and the tense atmosphere waiting downstairs. I stood in the hallway, torn between the heavy silence of my parents\u2019 living room and the uncertain tension of the lobby, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
