We\u2019d promised each other honesty, no matter how uncomfortable, and tonight was one of those nights where every word mattered. I could see the worry in their eyes, and I knew I owed them my full attention\u2014open communication was the foundation of our marriage. Just as I was about to respond, my phone buzzed insistently. It was a frantic message from my best friend: their car had broken down on the highway, miles away, and they needed me right now. I could hear the panic in their voice, and I knew I was probably the only person they could call at this hour. My spouse looked at me, waiting for my answer, while my phone vibrated again in my hand. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me\u2014my partner needing honesty and presence, my friend needing help and rescue. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to do, caught between two people who both needed me in different ways."}
