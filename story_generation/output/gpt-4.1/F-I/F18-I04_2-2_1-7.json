He didn\u2019t say anything, but I could tell something was wrong\u2014he always tried to hide it, but I knew the signs. I wanted to sit next to him, ask what happened, and just be there like I always promised I would. But my phone vibrated again, and I glanced down to see another message from my friend, the words sharp and cold. She\u2019d misunderstood my last text, and now she thought I was mad at her. I knew if I didn\u2019t call her right away, things would only get worse between us. My brother sniffled, wiping his nose on his sleeve, and I felt torn in two. I could hear the expectation in both silences: my brother needing me to listen, my friend needing me to explain. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, caught between the two people who needed me most."}
