Something serious had happened, and she needed me at her house right away. As a grandmother, I knew my family expected me to be there, to comfort and help them through whatever crisis had struck. I could already picture my grandchildren\u2019s anxious faces, waiting for me to arrive.\n\nBut as I reached for my coat, I glanced at the window. The wind was picking up, and the radio crackled with a storm advisory. Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, lived alone just down the hall. We always looked out for each other, especially during bad weather. She depended on me to check in, make sure she had candles, and help her feel less alone when thunder rattled the windows. I knew she\u2019d be worried tonight, and I\u2019d promised to help her if a storm ever hit.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the urgent pull of my family and the quiet responsibility I felt for Mrs. Lee. Both needed me, and I didn\u2019t know how I could possibly be in two places at once."}
