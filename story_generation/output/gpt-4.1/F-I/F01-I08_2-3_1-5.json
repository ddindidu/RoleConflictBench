I could sense the weight he carried, the way he avoided my eyes. As his grandfather, I felt the urge to share some of the lessons life had taught me, to offer him comfort and guidance, to let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. Just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed. It was an acquaintance from town\u2014someone I didn\u2019t know well, but who had always been kind. Their message was urgent: their car had broken down on a deserted road, and they needed help. I knew the expectation; when someone asks for help, you go. But my grandson needed me, too, maybe more than ever. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, each role demanding something different from me. I looked at my grandson, then at my phone, feeling the pressure mount as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
