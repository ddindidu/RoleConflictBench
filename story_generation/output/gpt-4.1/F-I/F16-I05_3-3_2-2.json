I need your advice before tomorrow\u2019s meeting.\u201d I glance at the clock\u20149:30 p.m.\u2014and then at the closed bedroom door. My partner has barely spoken all evening, eyes red from crying, shoulders hunched in silent pain. They need me, now more than ever, to listen, to hold them, to reassure them that things will be okay. But my mentee\u2019s message is urgent; their career hangs in the balance, and I promised I\u2019d be there to help them navigate this pivotal moment. My heart aches as I weigh the expectations: the warmth and presence my partner craves, the steady guidance my mentee depends on. I feel torn, guilt pressing in from both sides, knowing that whatever I choose, someone I care about will feel let down. My hands tremble as I reach for my phone, caught in the impossible space between two people who need me, right now, in completely different ways."}
