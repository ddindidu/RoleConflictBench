My little sister nudged me, her eyes bright with excitement, waiting for my input. I knew how much it meant to her\u2014and to my parents\u2014that I was present and involved in these moments. But my phone vibrated in my pocket, and my heart sank as I saw my friend\u2019s name flash on the screen. Just an hour ago, I\u2019d made a careless joke that clearly stung, and now I could see the message: \u201cCan we talk?\u201d I knew I needed to call, to explain, to fix what I\u2019d broken. But my family was watching, expecting me to laugh, to share, to be part of them right now. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s togetherness and the urgent need to reach out to my friend before the hurt grew deeper. I felt the pressure mounting, my loyalties stretched thin, unsure which role to step into first."}
