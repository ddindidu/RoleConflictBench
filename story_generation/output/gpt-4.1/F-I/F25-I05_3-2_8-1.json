She\u2019d been struggling with her project, and I\u2019d promised to help her break it down step by step. Just as I was about to log in, my phone buzzed. It was my stepdad, his voice trembling. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d he asked, and I could hear the weight in his words. He rarely reached out like this. He started sharing about his recent job loss, his fears, and how lost he felt. I knew he needed me to listen, to reassure him, to be the emotional anchor he was searching for.\n\nBut as he spoke, I saw the clock ticking closer to my call with Maya. She depended on me too, expecting guidance and encouragement to get through her project. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014one by the parent who needed comfort, the other by the mentee who needed my support. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety swirling as I tried to figure out how to be there for both, knowing I couldn\u2019t give either the attention they deserved at the same time."}
