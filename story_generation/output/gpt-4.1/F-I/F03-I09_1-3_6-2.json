Dad\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I knew what she wanted\u2014someone to check in, to ask if everything was okay, to be the son who notices when things aren\u2019t right. I promised myself I\u2019d call as soon as I got back. As I stepped into the lobby, I ran into Mrs. Kim from down the hall. She smiled, but I could sense tension. The noise complaint had everyone on edge, and I knew she expected me to be extra polite, maybe even apologize on behalf of the floor. I wanted to be the good neighbor, the one who keeps things friendly. But my mind was already with my parents, worrying about what I\u2019d say, how I\u2019d support them. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one part of me wanting to rush home and call my parents, the other knowing I should stop and chat with Mrs. Kim, smooth things over. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between being the attentive son and the considerate neighbor, unsure which role to step into first."}
