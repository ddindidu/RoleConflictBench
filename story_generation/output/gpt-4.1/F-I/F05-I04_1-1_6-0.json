She mentioned a tense moment with her boss, her voice light but her eyes searching for a response. I knew she valued our open communication, expected me to listen and share my thoughts, to be present. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from Mark, my oldest friend. \u201cRough day. Everything feels pointless,\u201d he wrote. I could almost hear the heaviness in his words. He\u2019d always counted on me to listen, to be the one who understood when he needed to vent. I glanced at my wife, who was waiting for me to say something, and then at my phone, feeling the weight of both their needs pressing in. My mind raced, torn between being the attentive husband she deserved and the supportive friend Mark needed. I felt the tension coil in my chest, unsure how to be both at once."}
