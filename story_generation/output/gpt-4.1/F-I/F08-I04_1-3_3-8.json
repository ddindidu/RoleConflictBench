The living room was already filling with the laughter of my grandchildren, the smell of my daughter\u2019s casserole wafting from the kitchen. Today was our long-awaited family gathering, and I\u2019d promised myself to be fully present, to soak in every moment with them. But as I set the table, my phone buzzed with a message from my friend, Linda. Her words stung: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that yesterday. I thought you understood me.\u201d Guilt twisted in my chest. I hadn\u2019t meant to hurt her, but I knew from years of friendship that if I didn\u2019t call her now, the misunderstanding would fester. My family expected my undivided attention, but Linda needed to hear my voice, to know I cared enough to make things right immediately. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, torn between the warmth of my family and the ache of a friendship in jeopardy, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
