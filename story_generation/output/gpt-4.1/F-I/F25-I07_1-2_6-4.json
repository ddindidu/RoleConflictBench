My colleague, Priya, had already messaged me twice, reminding me that she couldn\u2019t start her part until I finished mine. The pressure was mounting; I knew any delay on my end would throw off the whole team\u2019s schedule. Just as I was about to dive in, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my stepdad: \u201cCan we talk? Your mom\u2019s been quiet lately.\u201d I remembered my promise to check in more often, to be the emotional glue holding our patchwork family together. Guilt gnawed at me\u2014if I ignored him, I\u2019d be letting my parents down, but if I called, I\u2019d lose precious time and risk missing the deadline. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: be the supportive step-child they needed, or the reliable colleague my team depended on. The clock ticked, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unable to silence the worry for my family or the anxiety about letting my team down."}
