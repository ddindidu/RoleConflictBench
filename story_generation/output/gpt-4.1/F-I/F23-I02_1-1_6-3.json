My stepson had been talking about it for weeks, and I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d get it if I could. But the price tag made my stomach twist. I knew how much it would mean to him, but I also knew our budget was tight. As I mulled it over, my phone buzzed with a message from my girlfriend: \u201cHey, we finally have a few free nights! When can we have our date?\u201d She\u2019d been patient, waiting for us to have time together, and I missed her. I wanted to make her feel special, to show her she was a priority. But if I bought the Nintendo, I\u2019d have to cut back on everything else this week\u2014including a nice night out. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of my promise to my stepson pressing against the hope in my girlfriend\u2019s text. My mind raced, trying to figure out how to be both the reliable step-parent and the attentive boyfriend, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully be both at once."}
