My mom\u2019s voice still echoed in my mind from our call earlier\u2014she\u2019d finally told me about her worries at work, her voice trembling as she asked if I could come over tonight. She never asked for help, and I knew she needed me to listen, to reassure her that things would be okay. But as I stared at my phone, a new message popped up from Alex: \u201cCan we talk tonight? I don\u2019t want to go to bed angry again.\u201d We\u2019d been fighting all week about money, and I could feel the distance growing between us. I knew he expected me to help fix things, to show I cared enough to work through it together. My chest tightened as I thought about both of them\u2014my mom needing comfort, Alex needing resolution. I wanted to be there for both, but the weight of their needs pressed down on me, making it hard to breathe. I sat frozen, torn between the two people I loved most, not knowing who needed me more tonight."}
