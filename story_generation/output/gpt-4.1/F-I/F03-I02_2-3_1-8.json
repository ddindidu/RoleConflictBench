She\u2019s in the other room, waiting for me to come back and talk things through, to prove that I care enough to fight for us. But the screen lights up with my mom\u2019s name\u2014our weekly call, the one I promised never to miss. I know she\u2019s waiting to hear about my week, to tell me about Dad\u2019s new hobby and ask if I\u2019m eating well. I can almost hear her gentle disappointment if I don\u2019t pick up. My girlfriend\u2019s muffled sobs drift through the door, and my heart twists. I want to be the son who never lets his parents down, who keeps them close even from miles away. But I also want to be the boyfriend who doesn\u2019t walk away when things get hard. The phone keeps ringing, and I stare at it, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
