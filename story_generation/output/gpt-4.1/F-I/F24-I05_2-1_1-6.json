His eyes were red, and he didn\u2019t look up when I called his name. As his step-sibling, I knew I should sit beside him, listen, and offer comfort\u2014he\u2019d always been there for me, and I owed him the same.

As their mentor, I was supposed to guide them, help them develop better habits, and be available when they needed advice. I could hear Jamie\u2019s anxiety in her texts, and I knew she was waiting for me to respond.
