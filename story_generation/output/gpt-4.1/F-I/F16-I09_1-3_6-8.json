I wanted to share everything\u2014work stress, the funny thing that happened at lunch, the neighbor\u2019s request\u2014but I hesitated. My spouse values open communication, always encouraging me to talk about what\u2019s on my mind. But I was distracted, thinking about the neighbor\u2019s travel plans. She\u2019d asked me to keep an eye out for her packages, especially with the power interruption coming up. I promised I would, but now I was worried: what if the building\u2019s entry system failed and I couldn\u2019t get her deliveries? What if she needed something urgent and I missed it? My spouse was waiting for me to open up, but my mind was split. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014wanting to be present and honest at home, but also responsible and reliable as a neighbor. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself caught in the middle, unsure which role needed me more in that moment."}
