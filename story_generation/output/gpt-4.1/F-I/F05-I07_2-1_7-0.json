My wife moved quietly around the room, her face drawn and distracted. I\u2019d noticed her silence all evening, the way she kept glancing at her phone, sighing softly. As a husband, I knew I should reach out, ask her what was wrong, and really listen. We\u2019d promised to be open with each other, to share our worries instead of bottling them up. But as a colleague, I was expected to be present in these meetings, to contribute and show my engagement, even if it was just a routine catch-up. The meeting would be recorded, but I knew my absence would be noticed. My wife sat down across from me, her eyes searching mine, just as my screen flashed with the meeting notification. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the woman I loved and the team that counted on me. I hesitated, caught between the urge to close my laptop and the pressure to click \u201cJoin Meeting,\u201d my mind racing with the weight of both expectations."}
