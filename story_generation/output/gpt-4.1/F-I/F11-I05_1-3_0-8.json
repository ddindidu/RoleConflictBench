He\u2019d just texted: \u201cBig news! I got the scholarship! Family dinner tonight?\u201d I knew how much this meant to him\u2014he\u2019d worked so hard, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there to celebrate every milestone. But as I typed out my congratulations, my email pinged. My mentee, Priya, was in crisis. Her presentation for the company\u2019s biggest client was tomorrow, and she was panicking. She needed me to review her slides, rehearse with her, and calm her nerves. I was her mentor, her guide, and she was counting on me to help her seize this career-defining moment.\n\nMy brother expected his sister to show up, to cheer him on, to make him feel seen. Priya expected her mentor to be present, to help her grow, to not let her down when it mattered most. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me from both sides. How could I choose between being the sister my brother needed and the mentor Priya deserved? My hands trembled as I stared at the two messages, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
