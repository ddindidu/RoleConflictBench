She was upset about something trivial\u2014probably another argument with our parents about her messy room. I knew I should be patient, listen to her, and try to understand her side, even if I didn\u2019t agree. That\u2019s what being a good sister meant: building mutual respect, even when we clashed.\n\nJust as I was about to ask her what was wrong, my phone buzzed. It was a text from my best friend: \u201cUgh, today was the worst. Everything felt pointless. Can I vent?\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words. She needed me to listen, to be there for her, to offer the kind of emotional support she always gave me.\n\nI looked at my sister, her arms crossed and eyes brimming with frustration, and then at my phone, my friend\u2019s message glowing on the screen. Both of them needed me, but in completely different ways. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be the sister my family expected and the friend my bestie needed\u2014at the exact same moment."}
