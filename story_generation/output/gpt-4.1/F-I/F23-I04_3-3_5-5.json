The store manager had just caught him slipping a candy bar into his pocket. As his step-parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences. I could see the fear in his eyes, and I wanted to guide him through this moment with both firmness and compassion. Just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed urgently. It was a frantic message from my best friend\u2014her car had broken down on the highway, miles away, and she was scared and alone in the dark. She needed me right now, and I could hear the panic in her voice. I felt torn in two. My stepson needed me to handle this crisis with care, to be the adult he could trust. But my friend was out there, vulnerable, counting on me to come to her rescue. I stood frozen, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which need to answer first."}
