It was a text from my younger brother: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.\u201d He never reached out like this unless something was seriously wrong. My heart clenched. As his sister, I knew I should be there for him, especially when he was in distress. But at the same time, my laptop screen flashed with reminders about the meeting. My manager had emphasized the importance of everyone\u2019s participation, even though the meeting would be recorded. I could technically catch up later, but I worried about missing out on discussions and being seen as less committed by my colleagues. I stared at my phone, torn between the urge to call my brother immediately and the pressure to fulfill my responsibilities at work. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between being the supportive sister he needed and the reliable colleague my team expected."}
