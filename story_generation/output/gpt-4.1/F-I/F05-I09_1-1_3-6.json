My wife sighs as she passes by, her eyes lingering on the mess. We promised each other to share the chores, and I know she\u2019s been carrying more than her share lately. I tell myself I\u2019ll fold it all this afternoon, make things right, lighten her load.\n\nJust as I\u2019m about to start, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from Mrs. Kim next door: \u201cA package is coming today. Could you please receive it if I\u2019m not home?\u201d She\u2019s missed a few deliveries lately, and I know how much she relies on neighbors for these small favors. I look at the clock. The delivery window overlaps with the only free hour I have before dinner, the same hour I\u2019d set aside for the laundry.\n\nI feel the pressure mounting\u2014my wife\u2019s unspoken hope that I\u2019ll finally tackle the laundry, Mrs. Kim\u2019s trust that I\u2019ll help her out. Both seem reasonable, both feel urgent. My mind races, torn between the expectations of being a good husband and a helpful neighbor, wishing I could split myself in two."}
