She\u2019d been hinting all week that she wanted to join us, and I knew including her would mean a lot to her. As her brother, I wanted to build that mutual respect, to show her she was welcome in my world. But just as I was about to invite her, our neighbor Mrs. Lee stepped into the corridor. She smiled and greeted me warmly, expecting the usual friendly exchange. I felt the pressure to be polite and not keep her waiting, but my sister was watching, waiting for my invitation. My mind raced\u2014should I pause to chat with Mrs. Lee, as a good neighbor should, or quickly invite my sister along before she lost hope? The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I stood there, torn, caught between the roles of brother and neighbor, unsure which demand to meet first."}
