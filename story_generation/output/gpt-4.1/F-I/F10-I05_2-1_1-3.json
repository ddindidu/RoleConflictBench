They looked forward to these calls, and I knew how much it meant to them, especially since I moved out of state. As I reached for my phone, my mentee, Jamie, appeared at my office door, her face anxious. \u201cDo you have a minute? I\u2019m really stuck on this project, and I could use your advice.\u201d She rarely asked for help, and I prided myself on being available, sharing what I\u2019d learned to help her grow. I glanced at the clock\u2014if I delayed the call, my parents would worry, but if I brushed Jamie off, I\u2019d be letting her down when she needed me most. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: the comfort of my parents\u2019 voices, the trust in Jamie\u2019s eyes. I stood frozen, torn between the roles that defined me, unsure which need to answer first."}
