His words still echo in my mind, sharp and uncertain, and I know we can\u2019t leave things like this. We need to talk, to fix what\u2019s broken before it shatters completely. But as I reach for my phone, I see it\u2019s my mom calling\u2014our weekly check-in, the one I promised never to miss. I can almost hear her gentle voice, asking about my week, wanting to know I\u2019m okay, expecting me to share and listen in return. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: my parents, who count on my calls to feel close, and Alex, who needs me to be present and work through our pain. My chest tightens as I stare at the screen, torn between the comfort of home and the urgency of love, knowing that whatever I choose, someone will be left waiting."}
