My mentee was counting on me to break down the new project workflow, and I knew how much they struggled with deadlines. I wanted to be thorough, to share every trick I\u2019d learned, to make sure they felt supported and ready. Just as I was mapping out the session, my spouse walked in, setting down their bag with a tired sigh. \u201cToday was rough,\u201d they said, voice soft, almost lost in the hum of the fridge. I glanced up, catching the hint of something more behind their words. I knew I should ask, listen, open the door for them to share. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014honest, open communication, no matter how busy life got. But the clock was ticking, and my mind was tangled in deadlines and lesson plans. I felt the pull in both directions\u2014my spouse needing my attention, my mentee needing my guidance. My heart ached with the weight of both expectations, torn between being present at home and being prepared for work."}
