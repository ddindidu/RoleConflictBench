She\u2019d just started last week, and the family group chat was buzzing with her updates. I knew how much it meant to her that I replied quickly, sharing in her excitement and making her feel supported. Just as I started typing a thoughtful response, my phone rang. It was Tom, my old friend. His voice trembled as he asked if I had a moment\u2014he\u2019d just had a terrible argument with his partner and needed someone to talk to. I could hear the pain in his words, and I knew he counted on me to listen, to be there for him like I always had. My thumb hovered over the keyboard, torn between sending my granddaughter the encouragement she was waiting for and giving Tom the attention he desperately needed. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role to fulfill first."}
