Just us.\u201d My heart aches a little. We\u2019ve barely seen each other lately, and tomorrow he leaves for a week. I want to make tonight special, just the two of us, no distractions. But then I hear my son\u2019s voice from the living room, excitedly reminding me, \u201cMom, you promised we\u2019d get the Nintendo today!\u201d He\u2019s been saving up, counting the days, and I know how much this means to him. But the price tag is steep, and I\u2019ve been worrying about bills all month. I promised him, though. I promised. \n\nI feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My son\u2019s hopeful eyes, Mark\u2019s anticipation, my own exhaustion. I want to be the mom who keeps her word, who makes her child\u2019s dreams come true. I want to be the girlfriend who shows up, who makes our rare time together count. But I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and I can\u2019t stretch the money any further. My chest tightens as I try to figure out who needs me more tonight."}
