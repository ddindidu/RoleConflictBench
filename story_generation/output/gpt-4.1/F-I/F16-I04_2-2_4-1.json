It was Jamie, my closest friend. I answered, and immediately heard the strain in their voice. \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now,\u201d Jamie said, voice trembling. I glanced at the overflowing basket, knowing my spouse was counting on me to get the laundry done so everyone would have clean clothes for tomorrow\u2019s busy day.
