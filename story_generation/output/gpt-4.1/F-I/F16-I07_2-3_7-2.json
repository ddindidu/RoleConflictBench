The team meeting was about to start\u2014this was the final discussion before we locked in the project\u2019s direction, and my input was crucial. My phone buzzed with reminders from my colleagues, and I could already imagine the disappointment if I missed it.

I could see the worry etched on their face, the kind that only comes out when something\u2019s really wrong.
