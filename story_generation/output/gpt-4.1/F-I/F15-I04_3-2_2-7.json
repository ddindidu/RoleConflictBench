As a parent, I knew I had to go to the school, talk to the teacher, and show my child that I take this seriously. But just as I was about to leave, my phone buzzed again. It was a message from my closest friend, Sarah. She sounded upset, hurt by a text I\u2019d sent earlier. She wrote, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that to me.\u201d I knew I had to call her right away, explain what I meant, and clear up the misunderstanding before it grew into something bigger. I felt torn in two. My child needed me to be present, to guide him through this difficult moment. But my friend needed me, too, to reassure her and save our friendship. Both roles demanded my immediate attention, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing down on me, making it hard to breathe.
