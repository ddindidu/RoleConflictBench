The numbers on the home loan statement glared at me from my inbox\u2014two months until the next big repayment. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of keeping our family secure, making sure my partner and stepdaughter never had to worry about losing our home. I knew I should be working overtime, maybe picking up extra shifts, anything to make sure we had enough. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: project update due tomorrow. As a mentee, I was expected to be transparent with my mentor, to reach out whenever I hit a wall. The truth was, I\u2019d been stuck on a technical problem for days, but I hesitated to admit it, afraid it would make me look incompetent. My mentor always said honesty was key, but what if I lost this opportunity? I stared at the screen, torn between sending an email to my mentor and searching for side gigs. My heart pounded as I weighed which responsibility to put first, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
