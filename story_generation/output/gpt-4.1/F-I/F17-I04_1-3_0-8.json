I see a text from Mom: \u201cHope you\u2019re having a good weekend! Miss you.\u201d I know she expects me to check in, even if it\u2019s just a quick call or a few texts. I haven\u2019t replied since yesterday, and guilt pricks at me. At the same time, my phone buzzes with a message from my friend, Jamie. The words sting: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that. I thought you understood me.\u201d My heart sinks. I realize my joke earlier wasn\u2019t funny to Jamie\u2014it hurt them. I need to call and apologize, to explain myself and fix things before it gets worse. But Mom\u2019s waiting, probably worrying, and I promised I\u2019d be better at keeping in touch. My thumb hovers over the call button, torn between reaching out to my mom or Jamie first. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, no matter what I do next, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
