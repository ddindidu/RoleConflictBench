My wife had mentioned it twice already, her voice tight with exhaustion. I knew she expected me to help, to share the load, especially since she\u2019d been working late all week. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from Mia. She was barely holding it together after her brother\u2019s accident, and I was the only one she wanted to talk to. She needed me to listen, to be present, to help her through the waves of grief that kept crashing over her. I felt pulled in two directions: the silent accusation of the laundry, the unspoken plea in Mia\u2019s texts. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how to be the husband my wife needed and the boyfriend Mia depended on, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
