Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I could almost smell the food already, and I knew how much it meant to my family that I showed up, especially since we hadn\u2019t all been together in weeks. But just as I was about to reply, another message popped up\u2014this time from Mia. \u201cCan we talk? I\u2019m really upset about earlier. I thought we were spending Saturday together.\u201d My stomach twisted. I could hear the hurt in her words, and I knew if I didn\u2019t call her soon, things might get worse. \n\nI felt pulled in two directions. My family expected me to be present, to laugh and share stories at the dinner table. But Mia needed me to listen, to reassure her that she mattered most.

My heart pounded as I weighed my choices, feeling the pressure of letting someone down no matter what I did."}
