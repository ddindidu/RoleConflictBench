Remembering how important it is to check in, I asked, \u201cIs everything okay at home, Mom?\u201d She smiled, but I could tell she appreciated the concern. Just as she started to open up about her day, my phone buzzed with a message from an acquaintance, Mark. He was in town and needed a recommendation for a good restaurant nearby. He sounded a bit lost and hoped I could help him out quickly.\n\nI felt torn. My mom was finally about to share something personal, and I knew she valued these moments when I showed I cared. At the same time, Mark was waiting for my reply, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down either. Both needed my attention, but in completely different ways. My mind raced, feeling the pressure of being a good daughter and a helpful acquaintance at the same time, unsure which role to prioritize in that moment."}
