It means a lot to your dad and me that you\u2019re there.\u201d I knew how important these family gatherings were, especially since I was still finding my place as a step-sibling. I wanted to show I cared, to be part of the family, even if it sometimes felt awkward.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a text from Mrs. Lee next door. \u201cHi! Could you please keep an eye out for a package this afternoon? I\u2019m working late and it\u2019s really important.\u201d She\u2019d helped me out before, watering my plants and checking my mail when I was away. I felt responsible, like I owed her this small favor.\n\nThe clock ticked closer to two. If I left for Grandma\u2019s, I\u2019d miss the delivery window. If I stayed, I\u2019d disappoint my new family. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
