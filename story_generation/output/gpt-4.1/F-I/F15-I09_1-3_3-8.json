It was Mrs. Lee from next door, suitcase in hand, asking if I could keep an eye out for her package deliveries while she was away. She mentioned the building\u2019s power would be out for a day, so she needed someone to make sure nothing was left outside too long. I assured her I\u2019d help, but as soon as she left, my daughter asked if we could go to the park tomorrow, a promise I\u2019d made earlier. The park trip would take up most of the afternoon, exactly when the packages might arrive. I felt torn\u2014on one hand, I wanted to show my daughter the importance of keeping promises and spending time together, but on the other, I didn\u2019t want to let down Mrs. Lee, who was counting on me. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I found myself caught between being the reliable neighbor and the dependable parent, unsure which expectation I should meet."}
