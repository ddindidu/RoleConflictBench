My father barely spoke during dinner, his eyes fixed on the tablecloth. I knew they were both carrying more than they let on, and I felt the weight of their unspoken worries pressing on me. I wanted to sit with them, to listen, to offer comfort\u2014just to be present as their son.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the project report for work was due soon. My team was counting on me to finish my part, even though the deadline was still a few days away and the others could move forward without it for now. I could technically delay, but I knew my colleagues expected reliability from me. I felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions\u2014one by the quiet needs of my parents, the other by the silent expectations of my team. My heart ached as I stood in the hallway, caught between the living room and my laptop, unsure which way to turn."}
