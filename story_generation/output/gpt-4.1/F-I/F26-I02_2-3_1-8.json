Our argument from last night still hung heavy in the air, unresolved and raw. She wanted answers, a plan, some sign that I was willing to fight for us. But just as I started to type a reply, my granddaughter shuffled in, her eyes red and shoulders slumped. She tried to smile, but I could see the weight she carried. I knew she needed me to listen, to offer the kind of gentle advice only a grandparent could give. Yet my mind was split\u2014half of me aching to comfort her, the other half pulled by the urgent need to fix things with my girlfriend before it was too late. I felt the pressure mounting, the expectation to be wise and steady for my granddaughter, while also being present and committed for my girlfriend. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t be both at once, and I sat there, torn, not knowing which role to answer first."}
