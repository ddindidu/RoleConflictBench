My friend\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and I could hear her sobbing before she even spoke. She\u2019d just gotten terrible news about her family, and her voice trembled as she tried to explain. I knew she needed me to listen, to be there for her, to help her feel less alone. But as I sat on the edge of my bed, I glanced over at my younger brother\u2019s closed door. He had his final exam in the morning, and he\u2019d been pacing his room all evening, barely holding it together. He\u2019d asked me earlier if I could sit with him for a bit, just to help calm his nerves. Now, I felt torn in two\u2014my friend\u2019s pain was raw and immediate, but my brother was counting on me, too. The weight of both their needs pressed down on me, and I could feel my own anxiety rising as I tried to figure out who needed me more in that moment."}
