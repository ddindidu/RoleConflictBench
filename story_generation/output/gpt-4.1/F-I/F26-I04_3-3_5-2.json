My daughter\u2019s message flashed on the screen: \u201cMom, can you come? We need you. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart pounded. I knew something serious was happening at home, and as a grandmother, I felt the weight of being the steady anchor for my family. I started to get out of bed, already planning what I\u2019d say to comfort my grandchildren and support my daughter.\n\nBut before I could even stand, my phone rang again. It was my oldest friend, her voice trembling and broken. She could barely get the words out\u2014her brother had just passed away unexpectedly. She needed me, not just as a friend, but as the one person who always listened, who always stayed on the line until the tears slowed and the world felt a little less cruel.\n\nI sat on the edge of my bed, torn. My family needed me, but so did my friend. Both expected me to be their rock, their comfort. My chest tightened as I stared at the phone, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds that needed me at the same time."}
