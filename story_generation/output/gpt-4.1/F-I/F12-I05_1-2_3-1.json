My husband\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen, \u201cDid you get a chance to fold these?\u201d I nod, guilt prickling at my skin. I promised we\u2019d share the chores, but the day slipped away. My phone buzzes\u2014another message from Priya, my mentee. She\u2019s stuck on her project again, and I know she\u2019s waiting for my feedback before tomorrow\u2019s deadline. I promised her I\u2019d be available, that I\u2019d help her grow. I glance between the laundry and my phone, feeling the weight of both promises. My husband expects partnership, teamwork at home. Priya expects guidance, reassurance. I want to be present for both, but right now, I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart pounds as I hover in the hallway, torn between the comfort of home and the responsibility of mentorship, wishing I could split myself in two."}
