They looked up and smiled, but I could see the tiredness in their eyes. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d they said, their voice light but edged with fatigue. I knew they wanted me to sit beside them, listen, maybe offer a hug or a few gentle words. I wanted to be there, to show I cared, to be the supportive spouse they deserved.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket, and my heart sank. I\u2019d just realized, from a mutual friend\u2019s message, that something I\u2019d said earlier had really hurt my best friend. I could picture them, alone and upset, replaying my careless words. I knew I needed to call, to explain, to apologize before the misunderstanding grew. My friend expected honesty and openness from me, and I owed them that.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in. My partner\u2019s hopeful eyes met mine, while my phone vibrated again, a silent reminder of my friend\u2019s pain. I felt paralyzed, caught between two people I cared about, unsure which need to answer first."}
