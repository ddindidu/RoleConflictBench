The store manager\u2019s stern gaze made my cheeks burn. As a parent, I knew I had to teach my son about honesty and consequences, but I also saw the fear in his eyes. I wanted to comfort him, but I couldn\u2019t ignore what he\u2019d done. My mind raced with what to say, how to turn this into a lesson without crushing his spirit.\n\nBut even as I tried to focus on him, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the code sample my mentor assigned was still unfinished. I had barely started, and the deadline was looming. My mentor expected me to show initiative and responsibility, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my son needed me to be present and firm, but my future depended on proving myself to my mentor. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the expectations of being a good parent and a dedicated mentee."}
