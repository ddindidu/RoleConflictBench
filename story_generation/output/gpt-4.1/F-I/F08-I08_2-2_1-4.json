Her shoulders slumped, and I could sense the weight she carried. As her grandmother, I felt the urge to sit beside her, share a story from my own childhood, and gently guide her through her troubles. I knew she needed reassurance, a reminder that feeling lost was only temporary, and that I was always here to listen.\n\nJust as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed. It was Linda, an acquaintance from my book club. She sounded flustered, explaining she was in the middle of moving and desperately needed help with some heavy boxes. She didn\u2019t have anyone else to call. I heard the strain in her voice, and as an acquaintance, I knew the right thing was to offer my support, to be there when someone reached out.\n\nI looked at my granddaughter, then at my phone, feeling the pull from both directions. My heart ached, torn between the wisdom I wanted to share and the help I was expected to give. I sat there, wrestling with the impossible choice, unsure which role to fulfill first."}
