She\u2019d finally opened up about her breakup, tears streaming down her face, and I knew she needed me to listen, to be present, to offer the kind of support we\u2019d always promised each other. But as she spoke, my phone vibrated again\u2014this time, a message from Mia, my best friend. She was already at the caf\u00e9, confused about where we were supposed to meet, and her texts were getting more frantic. I\u2019d promised Mia we\u2019d talk things out after our last argument, and I knew how much it meant to her that I communicate clearly and quickly. My sister\u2019s hand reached for mine, her eyes searching for comfort, while my phone kept buzzing insistently. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, each role demanding my full attention, each expectation clashing in this single, impossible moment."}
