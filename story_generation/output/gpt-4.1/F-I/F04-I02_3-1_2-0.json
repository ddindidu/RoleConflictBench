Her voice trembled\u2014she\u2019d just had a huge fight with her best friend and needed someone to talk to. I could hear the tears in her words, and I knew she was reaching out because she trusted me to be there, like I always had been. At the same time, my girlfriend walked in the door, dropping her bag with a sigh. She didn\u2019t say much, but I could tell from the way she slumped into the chair that her day had been rough. She looked at me, searching for comfort, maybe a hug or just someone to listen. My sister\u2019s voice crackled in my ear, desperate for support, while my girlfriend\u2019s silent plea hung in the air. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014my sister needed me, but so did my girlfriend. I wanted to be the person both of them could rely on, but I could already feel the weight of their expectations pressing down, making it hard to breathe."}
