I knew she wanted me to open up, to share the stress I\u2019d been carrying from work, just as she always did with me. She\u2019d been quieter lately, and I could feel the weight of her expectation\u2014she needed me to be present, to talk, to let her in. But my phone buzzed with a message from Mia, my girlfriend, reminding me that tonight was the only evening we could spend together before I left for a week-long business trip. She\u2019d been looking forward to this, hoping for a few hours of laughter and closeness, just us. I felt torn, the pressure mounting from both sides. My wife\u2019s silent plea for connection, my girlfriend\u2019s eager anticipation for time together\u2014both pulling at me, both deserving. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, guilt and longing twisting inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
