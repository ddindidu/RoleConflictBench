My phone buzzed on the coffee table. It was my friend, calling. I hesitated, but answered quietly, not wanting to disturb the fragile calm in the room. My friend\u2019s voice was shaky, on the verge of tears. \u201cCan you talk? I really need you.

I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014my partner needed me here, but my friend was reaching out, trusting me to be there for them too. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
