My friend\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and I answered to the sound of her sobs. She could barely get the words out\u2014her father had just been rushed to the hospital. I sat up, heart pounding, listening as she poured out her fear and confusion. I knew she needed me to be present, to listen, to offer comfort. But as I glanced at the overflowing laundry basket in the corner, anxiety twisted in my stomach. Tomorrow was packed with activities for the kids, and my spouse had reminded me earlier that we were out of clean clothes. I\u2019d promised to handle the laundry tonight, to share the load and keep things running smoothly at home. Now, torn between my friend\u2019s pain and my family\u2019s needs, I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore."}
