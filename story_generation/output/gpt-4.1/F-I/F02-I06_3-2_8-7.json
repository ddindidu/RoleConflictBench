My wife had gently reminded me last night that we needed to start setting aside more money, and I promised her I\u2019d figure it out. As I scrolled through my emails, a new message popped up from my mentor: \u201cI have a 30-minute slot at 2 PM tomorrow. Let\u2019s catch up then.\u201d I knew how rare it was for him to have any free time, and I\u2019d been waiting weeks for this chance to discuss my career growth. But 2 PM was also when I\u2019d planned to meet with the bank manager to discuss refinancing options\u2014something that couldn\u2019t be postponed if I wanted to keep us afloat. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations: be the reliable provider my family needed, or show my mentor the respect he deserved by not rescheduling yet again. I felt torn, the pressure mounting from both sides, and I wondered how I could possibly choose without letting someone down."}
