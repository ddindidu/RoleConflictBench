My daughter\u2019s open class was today at 2 p.m.\u2014she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play and asking if I\u2019d be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But at the same time, my inbox pinged with a reminder from my project manager: the report I was working on was due by 4 p.m., and my part was the first domino in a chain. If I didn\u2019t finish, the whole team would be delayed, and I knew how much everyone was counting on me. I could almost hear the disappointment in my daughter\u2019s voice if I didn\u2019t show up, and I could already imagine the frustration from my colleagues if I let them down. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my little girl\u2019s hopeful eyes, my teammates\u2019 trust. I sat at my desk, torn, wishing I could be in two places at once, feeling the impossible pull of being both a good father and a reliable colleague."}
