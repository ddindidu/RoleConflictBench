The project deadline was looming, and I knew how much they depended on me to guide them through the final steps. I\u2019d spent hours organizing the material, determined to make this session count. Just as I was about to start the video call, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my younger sister: \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now.\u201d I could sense the heaviness in her words\u2014she never reached out unless it was serious. As her brother, I\u2019d always promised to be there, especially when she was struggling. But as a mentor, I was expected to be reliable, to show up and deliver when it mattered most. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the urgent needs of my sister and the expectations of my team. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between being the brother she needed and the mentor they counted on."}
