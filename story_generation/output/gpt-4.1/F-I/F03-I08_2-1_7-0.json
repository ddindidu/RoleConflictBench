He gave a small, expectant smile, the kind that says, \u201cLet\u2019s exchange a few friendly words.\u201d I knew he\u2019d had a rough week, and I didn\u2019t want to seem cold or distant. At the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from Mom. Lately, she and Dad had seemed so worn out, their voices heavy with fatigue every time I called. I knew they needed me to be present, to listen, to offer comfort. But right now, I was torn. If I stopped to chat with Mr. Lee, I\u2019d have to put off calling my parents, even though I knew they were waiting for me. If I rushed past him, I\u2019d seem rude and unapproachable, maybe even hurt his feelings. My chest tightened as I tried to balance the weight of being a good son and a considerate acquaintance, feeling the pressure of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
