It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart tightened. As a grandmother, I\u2019ve always prided myself on being the family\u2019s anchor, the one who listens and offers comfort, especially in times of crisis. I knew my granddaughter was struggling, and I wanted nothing more than to be there for her, to maintain the closeness that holds us together.\n\nBut just as I was about to call, my calendar pinged\u2014a reminder of the meeting my mentor had squeezed in for me. She had a packed schedule, and I knew how rare this opportunity was. As her mentee, I was expected to be punctual, prepared, and respectful of her time. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the urgent need to support my family, and the responsibility to honor my mentor\u2019s generosity.\n\nMy hand hovered over the phone, torn between dialing my daughter and logging into the meeting. The expectations from both sides clashed inside me, leaving me paralyzed, my heart pulled in two directions."}
