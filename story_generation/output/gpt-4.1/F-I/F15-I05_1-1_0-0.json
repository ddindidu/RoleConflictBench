Just as I started to pack up, my phone buzzed again. It was Maya, one of my mentees, her message urgent: \u201cCan you talk? I need advice before my job interview in an hour.\u201d I knew how much this meant to her; she\u2019d been anxious for days, and I was her go-to for reassurance. My mind raced. If I called Maya now, I\u2019d be late for the kids. If I left, I\u2019d let Maya down when she needed me most. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my children\u2019s expectant faces, Maya\u2019s trust in my guidance. I stood frozen, torn between being the parent my kids needed and the mentor Maya counted on, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which promise to keep."}
