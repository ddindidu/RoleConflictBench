My partner\u2019s been working late all week, and I know they\u2019re counting on me to finally tackle the folding tonight. Just as I reach for the first shirt, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s my friend, voice trembling, asking if I have a minute. She\u2019s had another fight with her partner and needs someone to talk to. I hear the strain in her words, the expectation that I\u2019ll listen, be present, and help her sort through the mess of her feelings. But the laundry sits there, a silent reminder of my other promise, the one I made to my spouse. My chest tightens as I try to figure out how to be both the supportive friend and the reliable partner, feeling pulled in two directions by people I care about, each needing me in different ways, right now."}
