He\u2019d been talking about this new skateboard trick for days, and now he was determined to try it, no matter how risky it looked. As his older sibling, I felt a knot of worry tighten in my stomach. I was supposed to look out for him, keep him safe, maybe even talk him out of it if it seemed too dangerous.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my girlfriend. She\u2019d had a rough day at work and wanted to talk, maybe vent a little. I knew she needed me to listen, to be there for her emotionally, and I wanted to be that support. But as I glanced from my phone to my brother, who was already rolling toward the ramp, I felt torn in two. Both of them needed me, but in completely different ways, and I could feel the pressure mounting as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
