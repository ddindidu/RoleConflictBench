I know how much these gatherings mean\u2014my presence is expected, and I\u2019m supposed to help keep everyone connected, especially now that the grandkids are growing up so fast. At the same time, I glance at my laptop, where an email draft to my mentor sits unfinished. I have a minor question about some terminology in my project. It\u2019s not urgent, but I remember my mentor\u2019s advice: \u201cAlways reach out, even for small things. Communication is key.\u201d I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me. If I focus on the family, I might delay my response to my mentor, risking the impression that I\u2019m not proactive. But if I prioritize my mentee responsibilities, I might seem distant or distracted during our precious family time. My mind races, torn between the warmth of family tradition and the professional expectations I\u2019ve set for myself."}
