She had been talking about it for days, her eyes shining with excitement every time she mentioned showing me her artwork. I knew how much it meant to her that I\u2019d be there, sitting in the front row, cheering her on. As I grabbed my bag and headed out, I ran into Mrs. Kim in the lobby. She\u2019s the neighbor who lives right below us, and lately, there\u2019s been a lot of tension about noise complaints. Today, she looked especially stern, clearly waiting to talk. I could feel the weight of her expectation\u2014she wanted a polite, neighborly conversation, maybe even an apology or explanation. But my mind was already at the school, picturing my daughter scanning the crowd for my face. I felt torn, my heart pounding with guilt and anxiety, knowing that whatever I did next, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
