She wanted to talk\u2014she said she felt I\u2019d been distant lately, and she hoped we could clear the air. I knew she expected me to be honest, to listen, to work through whatever tension had crept between us. But just as I was about to reply, my boyfriend walked in, his shoulders slumped, eyes tired. He didn\u2019t say much, but I could tell he\u2019d had a rough day. I knew he needed me to be present, to listen and comfort him, to be the supportive girlfriend he could lean on.\n\nMy heart tugged in two directions. If I called my sister now, I might finally resolve our misunderstanding, show her the respect she deserved. But if I turned away from my boyfriend, I\u2019d be letting him down when he needed me most. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both their expectations pressing in, unsure which role to step into first."}
