She had her final exam tomorrow, and I knew how much it meant to her. I wanted to be there, to sit with her, maybe make her some tea, and just listen as she vented her worries. That\u2019s what we always did\u2014leaned on each other when things got tough. But just as I was about to knock on her door, I heard the doorbell ring. \n\nIt was Mrs. Kim from next door, holding a small cake, her smile warm and expectant. \u201cI just moved in and thought I\u2019d introduce myself,\u201d she said. I remembered how important it was to be welcoming, to make a good impression as a neighbor. She looked hopeful, waiting for me to invite her in, maybe share a slice and some conversation. \n\nI stood there, torn. My sister needed me, but so did this new neighbor, in her own way. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt my heart race as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
