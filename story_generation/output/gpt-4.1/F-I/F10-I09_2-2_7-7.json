I watch my parents move around the kitchen, their faces drawn and voices quieter than usual. I know they\u2019re worried about bills and Dad\u2019s health, and I want to sit with them, listen, and offer comfort like a good daughter should. But as I reach for the kettle, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor. She\u2019s anxious about the storm and asks if I could check in on her later, maybe help secure her balcony plants. I remember the last time her power went out, how scared she sounded through the wall. I feel torn, pulled by the need to be present for my parents, to reassure them they\u2019re not alone, and the responsibility I feel toward Mrs. Lee, who has no one else nearby. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, caught between the warmth of my family and the quiet plea from next door, unsure which door to open first."}
