Mom always reminded me to keep an eye on him, especially after that time he tripped near the busy intersection. Today, though, my mind kept drifting to the urgent emails piling up on my phone. The project at work was at a standstill until I finished my part, and the client was already getting impatient. My manager had sent a reminder: \u201cWe need your update by 5 PM sharp.\u201d I glanced at the time\u20144:15. We still had a good twenty minutes left to walk, and my brother was chattering about his day, oblivious to my growing anxiety. I knew I could let him walk the last few blocks alone; he was old enough, and it would give me just enough time to get home and finish the task. But what if something happened? I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides, my brother\u2019s safety on one hand and my team\u2019s trust on the other. My heart pounded as I tried to decide what to do next."}
