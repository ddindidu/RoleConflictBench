My laptop pinged with reminders, and I knew this was the final discussion before we locked in the project\u2019s direction. My input was expected\u2014no, needed\u2014by my colleagues. Just as I was about to join, my partner walked in, dropping their bag with a sigh. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d they said, voice light but eyes tired. I could tell they wanted to talk, maybe just a few minutes of comfort, a listening ear. I felt the weight of their unspoken need for support, the kind of presence I promised to be. But the meeting was starting, and my absence would be noticed. My mind raced, torn between the urge to sit beside my partner and the responsibility to my team. I could feel my heart pounding, caught between being the spouse who listens and the colleague who shows up."}
