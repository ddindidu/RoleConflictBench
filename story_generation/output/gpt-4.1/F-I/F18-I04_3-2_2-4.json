Her eyes were red, and she kept squeezing my fingers, searching for comfort. I knew she needed me to stay, to listen, to just be there for her. That\u2019s what we always promised each other\u2014no matter what, we\u2019d be each other\u2019s anchor in the storm.\n\nMy phone buzzed. It was Sam, my closest friend. His voice was frantic\u2014he was already halfway to the airport and thought he\u2019d left his passport at home. He begged me to check and, if it was there, to rush it to him. He couldn\u2019t miss this flight; it was for his grandmother\u2019s funeral. I could hear the desperation in his voice, the same kind of panic I saw in my sister\u2019s eyes.\n\nI felt torn in two. My sister needed me right here, right now. But Sam was counting on me, too, and I knew how much this meant to him. My heart pounded as I looked from my sister to my phone, feeling the weight of both their needs pressing down on me."}
