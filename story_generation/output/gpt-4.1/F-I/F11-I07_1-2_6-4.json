Everyone\u2019s excited!\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm and expectant. We\u2019d been working on building a better relationship, making sure to include each other in our lives. I knew how much it meant to her that I show up, not just physically, but as someone who cared enough to make time.\n\nBut my laptop screen glared back at me, the unfinished report blinking like an accusation. The deadline was tomorrow morning, and I was already behind. If I didn\u2019t finish tonight, my teammate would be stuck waiting, their own work delayed. I could picture the disappointment in their eyes, the subtle shift in trust. We all depended on each other to keep things moving.\n\nMy chest tightened as I weighed the expectations. My sister wanted me to be present, to show I valued our bond. My team needed me to deliver, to keep the project on track. I felt pulled in two directions, the pressure mounting as the clock ticked on."}
