Lately, they\u2019d seemed more stressed than ever, and I knew they needed me to be present, to listen, maybe even just to sit with them in silence. I felt the weight of their unspoken need for comfort settle on my shoulders. Just as I was about to ask if they wanted some tea, my phone buzzed. It was my friend, her name flashing on the screen. I answered, and immediately heard the tremble in her voice. She\u2019d just had a huge argument with her partner and needed someone to talk to\u2014someone to listen, to reassure her, to help her make sense of her feelings. I could hear my parents in the kitchen, their voices low and weary, and I could hear my friend\u2019s shaky breath through the phone. My heart pulled in two directions, each role demanding my full attention, each expectation impossible to ignore. I stood there, phone in hand, torn between the people who needed me most."}
