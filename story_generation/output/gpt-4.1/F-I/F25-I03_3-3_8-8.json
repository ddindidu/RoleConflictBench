My stepdad\u2019s voice still echoed in my mind from just minutes ago\u2014he\u2019d finally opened up about his job loss, his eyes pleading for reassurance, for someone to tell him it would be okay. I could see how much he needed me to be strong, to listen, to comfort him the way Mom used to before she passed. But as I tried to process his pain, my phone vibrated again. It was my boyfriend, texting furiously. Our argument from earlier had spiraled out of control, and now he was threatening to end things if we didn\u2019t talk it out right now. He needed me to be present, to help fix what was breaking between us. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the living room where my stepdad waited, and the phone where my boyfriend\u2019s words demanded my attention. I felt split in two, desperate not to let either of them down, but knowing I couldn\u2019t be everything to both at once."}
