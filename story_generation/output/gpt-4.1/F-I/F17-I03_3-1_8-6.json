My mom\u2019s voice still echoed in my mind\u2014she\u2019d just confided in me about her worries at work, her voice trembling as she asked if I could stay home tonight and talk. I could hear the hope in her words, the way she needed me to be her anchor, just for a little while. But as I tried to comfort her, my phone lit up again: a string of messages from my boyfriend. He was upset about our weekend plans, thinking I\u2019d forgotten about our date. He wanted to talk, to clear things up before it turned into something bigger. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my mom\u2019s vulnerability, my boyfriend\u2019s frustration. Both needed me, both expected me to be present, to listen, to fix things. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the urge to run to my mom\u2019s side and the need to reassure my boyfriend. I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing down, and I didn\u2019t know how to be enough for both of them at the same time."}
