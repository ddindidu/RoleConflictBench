As a parent, I knew I had to find a way to cover the rent and groceries this month\u2014my family depended on me for stability. Yet, my phone buzzed with reminders: the mentoring session I\u2019d promised my team was in an hour. They were counting on me to guide them through the final steps before their big project deadline, and I\u2019d spent days preparing a session to share the skills they needed. My heart twisted as I glanced at the clock. If I left now to pick up an extra shift, I could make enough to keep us afloat, but I\u2019d let my mentees down when they needed me most. If I stayed, I\u2019d fulfill my promise as a mentor, but risk falling short as a provider. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I sat there, paralyzed, torn between the needs of my family and the hopes of those who looked up to me."}
