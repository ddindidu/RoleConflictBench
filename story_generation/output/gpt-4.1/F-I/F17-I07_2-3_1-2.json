Every Sunday evening, I called my parents, just like I promised. They waited for my updates, eager to hear about my week, and I knew how much it meant to them. But tonight, my phone buzzed with a calendar alert\u2014our team\u2019s final meeting before the project deadline was about to start. My manager had stressed the importance of everyone\u2019s input, and missing it could mean my ideas wouldn\u2019t be heard, or worse, I\u2019d let the team down. My parents\u2019 voices echoed in my mind, asking about my health, my meals, my happiness. At the same time, I pictured my colleagues, eyes on the screen, waiting for my thoughts on the proposal. My heart pounded as I weighed the warmth of my parents\u2019 concern against the responsibility I felt toward my team. I felt pulled in two directions, each demanding my presence, each expecting me not to let them down."}
