They needed my input on the project outline before they could move forward, and I knew the expectation: quick, clear responses, especially during crunch time. But as I sat at the dinner table, my stepdad was passing around the salad, and my stepsister was telling a story about her new job. My mom caught my eye, her look gentle but firm\u2014she wanted me to be present, to put my phone away and join in. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I answered my colleagues now, I\u2019d be breaking the unspoken rule of family time, making my stepfamily feel like an afterthought. But if I ignored my phone, I\u2019d be holding up the team, maybe even letting them down. My heart thudded as I tried to smile at a joke, my mind split between the laughter at the table and the urgent pings from my pocket, torn between being a good step-sibling and a reliable colleague."}
