Tonight, as the kitchen fills with the scent of spices and my grandmother\u2019s gentle humming, I\u2019m expected to help\u2014chopping, stirring, and listening to tales of our heritage. It\u2019s a ritual that means a lot to my parents, a way to honor where we come from.\n\nBut as I glance out the window, I remember tomorrow is trash pickup day. Our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always asks if she can put her extra bags in our bin when there\u2019s space. She\u2019s elderly and struggles with heavy lifting. I promised her I\u2019d let her know if there was room this week. Now, the bin sits half-full at the curb, but if I leave the kitchen, even for a moment, my parents will notice. They expect me to be present, to show respect for our traditions. Yet, I can\u2019t ignore Mrs. Lee\u2019s need either. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I stand frozen, torn between honoring my family and helping my neighbor."}
