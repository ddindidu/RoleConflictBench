She\u2019d been talking about it for days, practicing her lines for the little play, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there in the front row. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from Alex. We\u2019d argued three times this week about money, and last night\u2019s fight still echoed in my mind. He wanted to talk, to finally sit down and work things out, and he was only free this afternoon. The same time as Mia\u2019s class. I felt the pressure building in my chest, torn between being the mother my daughter needed and the partner who should help fix what\u2019s broken. Both of them expected me to show up, to choose them, to make things right. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of their hopes and my own guilt, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be disappointed."}
