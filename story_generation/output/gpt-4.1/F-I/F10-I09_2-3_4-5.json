Our family has always honored our ancestors this way, and lately, everyone\u2019s been talking about how important it is to keep our traditions alive, especially now that my grandparents are getting older. But as I stepped into the hallway, I saw the notice from the HOA: an inspection was scheduled, and anything blocking the emergency exit would be cited. I glanced at the altar, draped in red cloth and surrounded by offerings, right in the shared corridor. I knew Mrs. Lee from next door would be upset if we got another warning\u2014she\u2019s always careful about the rules and expects the same from everyone. My heart pounded as I stood between the altar and the door, torn between my family\u2019s expectations and my responsibility as a neighbor. I could already feel the weight of both sides pressing in, demanding I choose."}
