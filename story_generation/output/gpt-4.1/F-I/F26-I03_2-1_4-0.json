She was excited\u2014my grandson had just won his first art competition, and the whole family was gathering tonight to celebrate. I could already picture his proud little face, the way he\u2019d look for me in the crowd, hoping I\u2019d be there to cheer him on. But as I started to reply, my partner walked in, dropping his bag with a heavy sigh. He didn\u2019t say much, but I could see the tension in his shoulders, the way he avoided my eyes. I knew he\u2019d had a rough day at work, and he always said my presence helped him unwind. I felt pulled in two directions: my family expected me to be the doting grandparent, present for every milestone, while my partner needed me to be his safe place, his comfort after a long day. My heart ached as I tried to figure out how to be both, knowing that no matter what I chose, someone I loved would be disappointed."}
