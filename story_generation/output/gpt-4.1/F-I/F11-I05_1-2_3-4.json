My mentees were counting on me to guide them through the last steps before their big project deadline, and I wanted to make sure I covered every detail. Just as I was reviewing my slides, my younger brother plopped down beside me, grinning. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about what to do this weekend\u2014come help us decide!\u201d My mom called from the living room, \u201cWe want everyone\u2019s input!\u201d\n\nI glanced at the clock. If I joined them now, I\u2019d lose precious time to prepare, and I knew my mentees needed me to be at my best. But my family expected me to be present, to laugh and share ideas, to be a good sister. The voices from the living room grew louder, and my brother nudged me, eyes hopeful. My mind raced, torn between the warmth of family and the responsibility of mentorship. I felt the pressure mounting, the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, and I sat frozen, unable to choose."}
