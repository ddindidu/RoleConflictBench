Every week, I call my parents at this time. It\u2019s our ritual\u2014my mom waits for my stories, my dad always asks if I\u2019m eating well. They expect me to check in, to show I care, and I know how much it means to them. But just as I\u2019m about to dial, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from my friend, Jamie. He\u2019s upset, misreading my earlier text as cold and dismissive. His reply is sharp, and I can feel the hurt behind his words. I know I should call him right now, clear things up before the misunderstanding grows. Jamie expects honesty and quick resolution\u2014he hates letting things fester. My parents are waiting, but so is Jamie, both needing me in different ways. My chest tightens as I hold the phone, torn between the comfort of family routine and the urgency of mending a friendship. I can\u2019t do both at once, and the pressure to choose is almost unbearable."}
