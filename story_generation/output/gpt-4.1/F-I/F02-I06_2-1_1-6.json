My daughter\u2019s open class at school was tomorrow afternoon\u2014she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play, asking if I\u2019d be there. I could still hear her hopeful voice, \u201cYou\u2019ll come, right, Dad?\u201d At the same time, my mentor had finally set aside open office hours this week, a rare chance to get feedback on my project. He\u2019d emphasized how important it was to use this time wisely, and I knew how busy he was. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me: my daughter\u2019s shining eyes, my mentor\u2019s trust in my commitment. I wanted to be the father who never missed a moment, and the mentee who respected his mentor\u2019s time. My chest tightened as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. I sat at the kitchen table, torn, the clock ticking louder with every passing second."}
