She needed me\u2014her world felt like it was falling apart, and I was the only one she could lean on. I promised her I\u2019d be there, that I wouldn\u2019t leave her side. Just as I tried to soothe her, my phone buzzed. It was a message from our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, reminding me about the package she was expecting. She\u2019d mentioned how important it was, and how she\u2019d be at work all day. I\u2019d always told her she could count on me for these little things, and she trusted me to help out. Now, I felt torn. My wife\u2019s pain was raw and immediate, but Mrs. Lee was depending on me too. I could see both needs so clearly\u2014my wife\u2019s desperate for comfort, my neighbor relying on my small act of kindness. My chest tightened as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and both roles demanded more from me than I could give."}
