My daughter had called earlier, reminding me how much the grandkids were looking forward to baking cookies and playing board games together. I could already picture their eager faces, the laughter echoing through the house. But as I set the phone down, an email notification blinked on my screen. It was from my mentee, Sarah, her words tinged with anxiety\u2014she\u2019d just been shortlisted for a major promotion, and the final interview was scheduled for Monday. She asked if I could spare some time this weekend to help her prepare, saying she valued my guidance more than ever.\n\nA knot formed in my stomach. My family expected my full presence, to be the grandparent who never missed a moment. Yet Sarah needed me, too, counting on my mentorship at a pivotal point in her career. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each pulling in a different direction. I sat in silence, torn between the warmth of family and the responsibility to nurture another\u2019s growth, unsure how to honor both without letting someone down."}
