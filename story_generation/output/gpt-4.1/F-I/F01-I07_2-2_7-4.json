My phone buzzed with a message from my granddaughter, her words bubbling with excitement about her new job. She wanted to talk, to share her first impressions and the little victories of her first week. I knew how much it meant to her that I listened, that I was present for these milestones. At the same time, my inbox pinged with a reminder from my project manager\u2014my part of the report was due by midnight, and any delay would hold up the entire team. I could almost feel the weight of my colleagues\u2019 expectations, knowing how much they relied on me to keep things moving. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of family, the responsibility of work. I stared at the phone, then at the unfinished report, feeling the pressure build as I wrestled with which role to honor in this moment."}
