My granddaughter, bright-eyed and hopeful, had just asked me how to handle the uncertainty of starting college. She wanted my stories, my advice, the comfort of knowing she wasn\u2019t alone in her fears. I could hear the expectation in her voice\u2014she needed my wisdom, my calm assurance that she would find her way. But as I typed out a reply, my partner\u2019s muffled sobs drifted from the bedroom. He\u2019d lost his brother only yesterday, and I knew he needed me too\u2014my arms, my quiet presence, my willingness to just listen and hold him through the pain. My heart pulled in two directions: one toward the future, offering guidance and hope, and the other toward the present, offering comfort and strength. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding all of me, and I sat frozen, torn between the needs of those I love."}
