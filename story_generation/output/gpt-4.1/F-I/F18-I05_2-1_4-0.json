Mom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone\u2019s counting on you to be there.\u201d I knew how much these gatherings meant, especially since we hadn\u2019t all been together in weeks. At the same time, my mentee, Jamie, texted me, \u201cCan we talk tonight? I have to decide about this internship by tomorrow.\u201d Jamie rarely asked for help, and I knew how much this decision was weighing on them. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my family expected me to show up, laugh, and be present, while Jamie needed my guidance, even if just for a short call. I wanted to be the reliable sibling, the one who never missed a dinner, but I also wanted to be the mentor who never let someone down. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, torn between the warmth of my family and the responsibility I felt toward Jamie."}
