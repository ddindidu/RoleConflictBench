My daughter had just called, her voice bubbling with excitement\u2014my grandson had won his first art competition, and the whole family was gathering tonight to celebrate. I could already picture his proud little face, the way he\u2019d look for me in the crowd, hoping I\u2019d be there to cheer him on. But as I set my phone down, I heard the front door open. My partner walked in, her shoulders slumped, eyes tired. She tried to smile, but I could see the weight of her day pressing down on her. She needed me too\u2014someone to listen, to hold her, to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. My heart tugged in two directions. I wanted to be the grandparent my family expected, present and joyful, but I also wanted to be the boyfriend she could lean on. The clock ticked, and I felt the pressure mounting, torn between two worlds that both needed me tonight."}
