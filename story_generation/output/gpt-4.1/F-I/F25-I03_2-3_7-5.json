They\u2019d both been working overtime, barely speaking, and I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to lighten the mood, to just be present. But my phone buzzed with a message from Jamie: \u201cCan\u2019t wait for our weekend. I\u2019ll miss you so much.\u201d This was our last chance to be together before she left for her new job overseas. She wanted to make memories, to feel close before the distance set in. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the daughter my parents needed, to reassure them, to help them through whatever was weighing them down. But I also wanted to hold Jamie\u2019s hand, to laugh with her, to make her feel loved before she left. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, torn between the living room and the front door, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
