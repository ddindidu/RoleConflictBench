My daughter had just called, her voice trembling as she shared the news of her husband\u2019s sudden illness. She needed me\u2014needed my comfort, my presence, the steady reassurance only a grandparent could give. I could picture my grandchildren\u2019s anxious faces, waiting for me to call, to tell them everything would be alright. But as I reached for the phone, an email notification flashed across my screen. My mentee, Sarah, was counting on me too. Her big interview was tomorrow, and she\u2019d asked for a last-minute session to practice. She\u2019d worked so hard, and I\u2019d promised to help her shine. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my family, who needed my love and support, and toward Sarah, who needed my guidance and encouragement. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I found myself frozen, torn between the roles that defined me, unsure which call to answer first."}
