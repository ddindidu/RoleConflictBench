My spouse walked in, their face drawn with concern. \u201cYou seem worried,\u201d they said gently, sitting across from me. I knew they expected me to share, to be open about what was weighing on me. I wanted to tell them everything, to let them in on the stress gnawing at me from work. But as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my mentor, asking for an update on the project. The conflict with my teammates had escalated, and the deliverable was at risk. My mentor expected me to communicate any issues promptly, to be transparent and proactive. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. Should I confide in my spouse, risking their worry, or focus on drafting a message to my mentor, admitting the project was in trouble? My heart pounded as I looked from my spouse\u2019s searching eyes to the blinking notification on my phone, caught between the need to be honest at home and responsible at work."}
