He started venting about how nobody in the family ever listens to him, and I could feel my patience wearing thin. I knew, as his brother, I was supposed to be patient and understanding, to respect his feelings even if I didn\u2019t agree. I took a deep breath, trying to remind myself that building mutual respect meant listening, not dismissing.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with a message from an acquaintance I barely knew from work. She was in town and asked if I could recommend a good restaurant nearby. I knew she was counting on me for a quick, helpful response. I glanced at my brother, still waiting for me to say something supportive, and then at my phone, feeling the pressure to be helpful and responsive.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. My brother needed my attention and understanding, but my acquaintance was waiting for my help. I could feel the stress building as I tried to figure out how to be both the supportive brother and the helpful acquaintance at the same time."}
