I know I should call him back, remind him about respecting public spaces and behaving properly. That\u2019s what a good parent does\u2014teaches discipline, sets boundaries. But just as I open my mouth, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from a group chat with some acquaintances. They\u2019re discussing a mutual colleague\u2019s recent decisions, and the conversation is turning critical. I know I shouldn\u2019t join in; I\u2019ve always believed in not speaking ill of others, especially when they\u2019re not present to defend themselves. Yet, I feel the pressure to respond, to fit in, to not seem aloof or judgmental. My son\u2019s laughter echoes, drawing annoyed glances from other shoppers. I feel torn\u2014do I step in and parent, risking being seen as inattentive in the chat, or do I respond to the group, letting my son\u2019s behavior slide for a moment? The expectations from both sides press in, and I can feel my heart pounding as I wrestle with what to do next."}
