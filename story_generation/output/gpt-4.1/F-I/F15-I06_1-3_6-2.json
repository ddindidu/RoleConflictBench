The deadline was tomorrow, and my mentor had stressed how crucial it was for my growth\u2014and for the team\u2019s impression on upper management. My phone buzzed with a message from my child: \u201cCan we go get the Nintendo today? You promised.\u201d I glanced at the bank app on my phone, the numbers lower than I\u2019d like. I knew buying the Nintendo would stretch our budget, but I\u2019d promised, and my child had been counting down the days. My mind raced, torn between the need to keep my word as a parent and the pressure to deliver as a mentee. If I left now to buy the Nintendo, I\u2019d lose precious hours needed to finish the assignment. If I stayed, I\u2019d break my promise and see disappointment in my child\u2019s eyes. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I felt the knot of anxiety tighten in my chest as I stared at the screen, unable to move."}
