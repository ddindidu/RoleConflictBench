Everyone, please be there.\u201d I knew how important these gatherings were to her, especially since I was still the \u201cnew\u201d one in the family. She wanted us all together, laughing and sharing stories, trying to make us feel like a real family. I could already picture the table set, the awkward silences, and her hopeful glances at me.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from Mrs. Patel next door. \u201cCould you please keep an eye out for my package this afternoon? I\u2019ll be at work late, and it\u2019s important.\u201d She\u2019d helped me so many times before, watering my plants when I was away, and I knew how much she relied on me for these little things.\n\nI felt the pressure building in my chest. If I left for dinner, I might miss the delivery, letting Mrs. Patel down. But if I stayed, I\u2019d disappoint my stepmom and maybe make things even more awkward at home. I sat on my bed, torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
