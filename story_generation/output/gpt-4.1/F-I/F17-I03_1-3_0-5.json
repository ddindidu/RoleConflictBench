Call us when you can!\u201d I glance at the screen, guilt prickling at me. I haven\u2019t called home all week, and I know my parents worry if I go too long without checking in. But right now, I\u2019m curled up on the couch with Alex, my head on his shoulder, watching the rain streak down the window. He leaves for London on Monday, and this is our last weekend together for months. He\u2019s been talking about all the things we should do before he goes, and I can feel how much he wants my undivided attention. My phone buzzes again\u2014Mom, this time with a photo of our dog. I want to be the daughter who calls home, who reassures her parents she\u2019s okay. But I also want to be the girlfriend who\u2019s fully present, soaking up every last moment with Alex. My heart tugs in two directions, and I stare at my phone, torn, wishing I could be in both places at once."}
