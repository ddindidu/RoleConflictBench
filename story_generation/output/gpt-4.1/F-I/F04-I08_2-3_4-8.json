As a brother, I knew how much these gatherings meant to everyone, especially to my younger sister, who always looked forward to our time together. My parents expected me to be present, to share stories, and to be part of the family\u2019s closeness. But tonight, my phone buzzed with a message from an acquaintance who had just learned something sensitive about a mutual friend\u2014something that, if shared, could damage that person\u2019s reputation. The acquaintance wanted to talk, maybe even vent, and I could sense the urge to gossip in their words. I felt torn. If I excused myself from the table to take the call, I\u2019d disappoint my family and break the flow of our evening. But if I stayed, I risked ignoring someone who might need guidance to avoid spreading harm. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I could feel my heart racing as I tried to decide which role I should honor in this moment."}
