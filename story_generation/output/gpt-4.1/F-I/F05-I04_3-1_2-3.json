Her eyes were red from crying, her voice barely above a whisper as she tried to explain how overwhelmed she felt. I knew she needed me\u2014needed my words, my presence, my reassurance that things would be okay. I wanted nothing more than to hold her and promise I\u2019d be there for as long as she needed.\n\nMy phone buzzed on the nightstand. It was a message from Mark: \u201cHey, man, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m losing my mind with this bookshelf. The instructions make no sense.\u201d I could picture him surrounded by planks and screws, frustration written all over his face. He\u2019d helped me out countless times before, and I knew he was counting on me now.\n\nI looked at my wife, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My heart ached with the urge to be the husband she needed, but guilt gnawed at me for leaving my friend hanging. The expectations from both sides pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of me to answer first."}
