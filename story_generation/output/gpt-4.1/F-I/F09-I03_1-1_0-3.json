It was almost three, and my kids would be waiting at the school gate, scanning the crowd for my face. I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there today, just like I always tried to be, cheering them on at their assembly. But my phone buzzed with a message from Alex: \u201cCan we do tonight? I miss you.\u201d We\u2019d both been so busy lately, and this week was the first time in ages we had a few evenings free. He wanted to make plans, to finally have that quiet dinner we kept talking about. I wanted it too\u2014craved the laughter, the warmth of his hand in mine. But the thought of my children\u2019s hopeful faces, the way they\u2019d search for me, made my stomach twist. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding a piece of me, and I didn\u2019t know how to be enough for both."}
