I know they\u2019re carrying a lot, and I feel like I should be there for them\u2014maybe sit with them after dinner, ask how their day was, or just listen. They\u2019ve always been there for me, and now it feels like it\u2019s my turn to support them, even if I\u2019m not sure how. But this week, my mentor has open office hours, and I know how rare that is. She\u2019s always busy, and she\u2019s made it clear that mentees should make the most of these times. I have questions about my project that I can\u2019t figure out alone, and I don\u2019t want to waste her time or seem uncommitted. I keep glancing at the clock, torn between staying home to be the child my parents need and heading out to be the mentee my mentor expects. My chest feels tight, and I wish I could split myself in two."}
