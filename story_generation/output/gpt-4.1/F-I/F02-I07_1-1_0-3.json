He\u2019d been so excited, asking me every morning if I\u2019d remember. I could picture his hopeful face, scanning the crowd for me. But as I started to shut down my laptop, my colleague pinged me: \u201cHey, can you send over the draft before you go? Would help me get a head start.\u201d The task wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew the team appreciated my reliability. I could probably finish it in half an hour, but that would mean being late to pick up my kids. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the schoolyard where my children waited, and toward my desk, where my team counted on me. I sat frozen, torn between being the dependable father my kids needed and the reliable colleague my team expected."}
