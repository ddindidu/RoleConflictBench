As his sibling, I knew he needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure him that he was more than a rejection letter. I wanted to call him right away, to be the shoulder he could lean on.\n\nBut just then, an acquaintance from work slid into the seat beside me, sighing loudly. \u201cDid you see Mark\u2019s latest project? Honestly, I don\u2019t know how he still has a job here.\u201d She looked at me, expecting agreement or at least a reaction. I remembered the unspoken rule among acquaintances: don\u2019t gossip, don\u2019t fuel negativity.

My heart pounded as I tried to balance the weight of being a good sibling and a respectful acquaintance, feeling the demands of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
