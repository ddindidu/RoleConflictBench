My parents and relatives were laughing, sharing stories, and I knew they expected me to join in, to honor our family tradition of togetherness during these rare gatherings. My phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced down and saw a message from my friend, Mia. Her words were short, clipped\u2014she thought I was upset with her because of a text I\u2019d sent earlier. I could feel her hurt through the screen. I knew she expected me to call her right away, to clear things up, to show her that our friendship mattered. My heart pounded as I looked from my family, waiting for me to participate, to my phone, where Mia\u2019s pain waited for my response. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on me, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
