My grandson clung to my hand, his eyes wide and searching for comfort. As a grandfather, I knew my family needed me now more than ever. They expected me to be present, to offer wisdom and reassurance, to help hold things together.\n\nBut as a mentee, I also felt the weight of my mentor\u2019s generosity. She had carved out precious time in her busy week just for me, and I\u2019d promised to make the most of it. I didn\u2019t want to let her down or seem uncommitted.
