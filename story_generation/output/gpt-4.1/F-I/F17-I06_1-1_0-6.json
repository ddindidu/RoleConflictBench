Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d I know she worries if I don\u2019t check in, and I promised I\u2019d text her every weekend. I start typing a reply, but then I remember my mentor\u2019s office hours are happening right now\u2014the only time this week she\u2019s free. She\u2019s always emphasized how important it is to respect her schedule, and I don\u2019t want to seem uncommitted or careless. My thumb hovers over the send button, torn. If I text Mom now, I might miss the chance to talk to my mentor about the project I\u2019m struggling with. But if I go to office hours and ignore Mom\u2019s message, she\u2019ll feel neglected, maybe even hurt. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I can feel my chest tighten as I try to decide who needs me more in this moment."}
