My wife\u2019s voice echoed from the kitchen, reminding me that her parents would arrive in a few hours. The living room still needed dusting, the guest room bed wasn\u2019t made, and the bathroom needed a quick scrub. She expected me to help, and I wanted to be the partner she could rely on, especially when family was involved. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the mentoring session I\u2019d promised my junior colleague was in thirty minutes. He was counting on me to walk him through the project\u2019s final steps before tomorrow\u2019s deadline. I could picture his anxious face, waiting for guidance, and I knew how much this meant for his confidence. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be a supportive husband and the responsibility to be a dependable mentor. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt the tension building inside me as I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, laptop in the other, uncertain which door to walk through first."}
