He\u2019d just snapped at his younger sister, and I knew I needed to address it\u2014teach him about respect and kindness, reinforce the values I wanted him to carry into adulthood. But my phone buzzed again: a message from Maya, my mentee at work. She was waiting for my feedback on her proposal, anxious about a decision that could shape her entire career. She needed my guidance, my full attention, and I\u2019d promised to review her work tonight.\n\nEthan\u2019s eyes flickered up, searching for my reaction, while Maya\u2019s message blinked insistently on the screen.
