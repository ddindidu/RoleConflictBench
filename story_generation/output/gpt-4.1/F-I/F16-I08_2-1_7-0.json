Remembering our promise to communicate openly, I sat down beside them, ready to share my own work frustrations and listen to theirs. Just as I began to speak, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that I needed to head to a meeting across the building. I promised my spouse we\u2019d talk later and hurried out, my mind still half with them.\n\nAs I walked down the quiet hallway, I spotted an acquaintance approaching. We weren\u2019t close, but I knew the expectation: be friendly, approachable, maybe even stop for a quick chat. My heart was still heavy with concern for my spouse, and I felt raw, exposed. I wanted to keep walking, to stay wrapped in my own thoughts, but I also didn\u2019t want to seem cold or distant. The pressure to be present for my spouse and simultaneously maintain a friendly front for my acquaintance pulled at me from both sides, leaving me tense and uncertain as we drew closer in the silent corridor."}
