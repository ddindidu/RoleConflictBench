My younger brother trudged in, eyes red and shoulders slumped. He dropped his backpack and headed straight for his room. As his sibling, I knew I should go after him, offer comfort, and let him talk about whatever happened at school. He always counted on me to be there, especially when things got rough with his friends.\n\nBut my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my mentee, anxious about our scheduled call in ten minutes. She was counting on me to help her prepare, to push her to be her best, and I\u2019d promised to be available tonight. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My brother needed me now, but so did my mentee. I stared at the hallway, then at my phone, heart pounding, caught between being the supportive sibling and the dedicated mentor, unsure which need to answer first."}
