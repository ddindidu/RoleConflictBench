She\u2019d been hinting that she wanted more time together, and I promised I\u2019d make it happen. As I glanced up from my phone, I saw my brother step off the curb, not even glancing at the cars speeding by. My heart jumped into my throat. I knew I had to keep him safe\u2014Mom always said I was responsible for him when we were out. But at the same time, my phone buzzed again. Mia was asking if I could do Thursday, saying she missed me. I felt pulled in two directions: my brother needed my full attention, but Mia was counting on me to make her feel important. I could feel the pressure building, the weight of both their expectations pressing down on me, and I hesitated, caught between shouting for my brother to stop and replying to Mia before she thought I was ignoring her."}
