Did you eat?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014already past nine. I hadn\u2019t replied to her morning text yet. Guilt pricked at me; we always kept in touch, and she worried if I didn\u2019t answer quickly. But just as I started typing, my mentee, Sam, called. He sounded anxious, asking for advice about a job offer he\u2019d just received. I knew he needed my full attention, and I wanted to help him think it through, but my mind kept drifting to Mom\u2019s waiting message. I tried to focus on Sam\u2019s questions, but my phone vibrated again\u2014another message from Dad, checking in. I felt torn, knowing my parents expected me to be present and responsive, while Sam needed thoughtful guidance. The pressure built inside me, each role demanding my time and care, and I sat there, phone in hand, caught between being a good son and a reliable mentor, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
