Everyone leaned in, eager to hear her story, and I knew how much it meant to her that I was present, listening, and celebrating with the rest. At that very moment, my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. It was a message from my friend, who sounded confused about where we were supposed to meet later. She needed a quick reply to clear things up, and I could sense her anxiety through her words. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014my family expected my undivided attention, especially now, but my friend was counting on me to communicate and resolve the misunderstanding. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, torn between being the attentive grandmother and the reliable friend, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
