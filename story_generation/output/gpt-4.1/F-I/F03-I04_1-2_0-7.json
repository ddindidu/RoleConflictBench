I remember Mom\u2019s gentle reminder last week: \u201cJust a quick text now and then, honey. We miss you.\u201d I haven\u2019t messaged them yet, so I start typing, \u201cHey, just checking in. Hope you\u2019re both well.\u201d Before I can hit send, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from Sam. His words are clipped, and I can tell he\u2019s upset. He\u2019s misunderstood my last text, thinking I was annoyed with him. My chest tightens. I know Sam hates unresolved tension; he expects me to call and clear things up right away. But my parents are waiting, probably worrying if I\u2019m okay. I stare at my phone, torn. If I call Sam now, I\u2019ll put off my parents again. If I text my parents first, Sam might stew in his hurt. Both expect me to be there, to communicate, to care. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, and I can\u2019t decide which to answer first."}
