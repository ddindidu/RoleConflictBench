I\u2019m stuck with this bookshelf and the instructions make no sense.\u201d I could almost hear the frustration in her words. She\u2019d just moved in, and I\u2019d promised to help however I could. But my mind was already at the school gates, picturing my kids waiting for me, scanning the crowd for my face. Pick-up was at 3:00, and they hated being the last ones left. I knew how much it meant to them that I was always there, right on time, ready with a hug and a snack. But Sarah sounded desperate, and I remembered how lost I\u2019d felt the first time I tried to assemble furniture alone. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my children\u2019s expectant faces and my friend\u2019s plea for help. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the weight of both promises pressing down on me."}
