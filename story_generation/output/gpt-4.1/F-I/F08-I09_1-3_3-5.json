My grandchildren had been talking about it for weeks, and I promised I\u2019d bring my famous lemon bars. As I packed up the treats, I caught sight of the hallway through my apartment door. My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had left her walker and a few boxes in the corridor again. I remembered the HOA notice\u2014inspection today. Anything blocking the exit could mean a fine for all of us.\n\nI felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As a grandmother, I wanted nothing more than to be present, to laugh and play with my grandkids, to be the heart of the family. But as a neighbor, I was expected to help keep our shared spaces clear and safe, to look out for everyone\u2019s well-being. If I left now, the inspector might come before Mrs. Lee returned. If I stayed to help, I\u2019d be late for the gathering, letting down my family. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
