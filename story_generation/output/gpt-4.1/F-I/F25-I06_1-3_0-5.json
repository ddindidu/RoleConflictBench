My stepdad had texted me twice already this weekend, asking how I was doing and if I wanted to come over for dinner. I knew he wanted me to check in more often, to show I cared about being part of the family. But my mind kept drifting back to the email from my mentor, waiting for my update. The project at work was falling apart\u2014my teammates were arguing, and deadlines were slipping. My mentor expected me to be open about problems, to reach out as soon as things got tough. I felt pulled in two directions: if I texted my stepdad, I\u2019d be ignoring the mounting pressure at work; if I emailed my mentor, I\u2019d be letting my family down again. My chest tightened as I scrolled between the two conversations, wishing I could be in two places at once, wishing I didn\u2019t have to choose who to disappoint."}
