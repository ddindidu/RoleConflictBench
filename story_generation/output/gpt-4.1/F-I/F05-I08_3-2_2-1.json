She needed me\u2014needed my full attention, my comfort, my words to anchor her. I wanted nothing more than to hold her, to reassure her that I was there, that she wasn\u2019t alone in this storm. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the dinner party we\u2019d promised to attend. I\u2019d barely met the host, and I knew from our brief conversations that he was anxious about making new friends. He\u2019d asked me to help break the ice, to be the friendly face that would put his shy cousin at ease. I could picture the nervous cousin, scanning the room for someone approachable, someone who would make him feel welcome. My wife\u2019s hand tightened around mine, her silent plea for me to stay. My mind raced, torn between the person who needed my unwavering support and the stranger who needed a gentle introduction to a new world. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between them."}
