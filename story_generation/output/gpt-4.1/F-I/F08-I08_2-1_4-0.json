My old friend from the book club, someone I only knew in passing, was walking down the hallway toward me. I could see her from the kitchen window, her face brightening as she caught my eye. At that very moment, my grandson tugged at my sleeve, his eyes wide with excitement. \u201cGrandma, come see! I got the lead in the school play!\u201d His voice was full of hope, and I knew how much this meant to him. But my acquaintance was almost at the door, expecting a warm greeting, maybe a few minutes of friendly conversation. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family expecting my undivided attention, my acquaintance expecting kindness and approachability. My heart raced as I stood frozen, torn between the joy of my grandson\u2019s news and the social grace owed to someone who might need a friendly word. I could feel the tension rising, unsure which role to honor in that fleeting moment."}
