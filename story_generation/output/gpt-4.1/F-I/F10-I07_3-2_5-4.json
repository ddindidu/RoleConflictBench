It means a lot to your grandmother.\u201d My heart squeezed. I knew how important it was to my family that I uphold our traditions, especially now, when everyone looked to me to carry them forward. But as I glanced at my laptop, the unfinished project stared back at me. The deadline was tomorrow, and my part was crucial\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish, my teammate\u2019s work would stall, and the whole team would be set back. My manager had emphasized how important it was to meet this deadline, and I didn\u2019t want to let anyone down. The weight of both worlds pressed on me: the pride in my family\u2019s eyes if I led the ceremony, the trust my colleagues placed in me to deliver. I felt torn, anxiety twisting in my stomach, as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once, meeting everyone\u2019s expectations."}
