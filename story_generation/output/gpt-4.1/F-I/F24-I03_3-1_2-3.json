My stepbrother\u2019s text was raw and desperate\u2014he\u2019d just found out his dad was seriously ill, and he needed someone to talk to. I could almost hear his voice cracking, and I knew he expected me to be there, to listen, to help him hold it together. At the same time, my boyfriend\u2019s message was light and hopeful, asking which night I wanted to go out this week. He\u2019d been looking forward to us finally having time together, and I could picture his smile, the way he\u2019d planned something special just for us. My heart twisted as I thought about how much I wanted to be with him, to laugh and forget everything for a while. But I also couldn\u2019t ignore my stepbrother\u2019s pain. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt torn in two, unable to figure out how to be what both of them needed right now."}
