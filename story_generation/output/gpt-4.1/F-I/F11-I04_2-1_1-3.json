She\u2019d been crying all afternoon after a fight with our parents, and I promised I\u2019d be there for her. But the message on my screen was from Maya, my best friend. \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m losing my mind with these IKEA instructions.\u201d I could almost hear the frustration in her text. She\u2019d just moved into her new apartment, and I\u2019d promised to help her settle in whenever she needed.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. My sister was expecting me to sit with her, maybe just listen or offer a hug\u2014something to show I cared. But Maya was alone, probably surrounded by half-built shelves and screws, counting on me to be her lifeline. Both needed me, both counted on me to show up. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides. I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
