She\u2019d carved out this time for me, despite her packed schedule, and I knew how much she valued punctuality and focus. But across from me, my granddaughter slumped in her chair, eyes rimmed red, her silence heavy. I recognized the look\u2014something was weighing on her, something she wasn\u2019t ready to say aloud. As her grandmother, I felt the pull to stay, to offer the comfort and wisdom she might need, to be the steady presence she could lean on. Yet, as a mentee, I was expected to show respect for my mentor\u2019s time, to be present and prepared, not distracted or late. My heart ached as I glanced between the clock and my granddaughter, torn by the demands of both roles. I wanted to be everything for both of them, but I could feel the tension rising inside me, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my full self to both at once."}
