He asked about my day, his tone light, expecting the usual open exchange we promised each other. I hesitated, feeling the weight of another argument with my boyfriend earlier\u2014this time about money, again. My boyfriend wanted us to talk things through, to resolve the tension that had been building all week, but I\u2019d left the conversation unfinished, promising I\u2019d call back later. Now, my husband looked at me, waiting for me to share, to be honest, as we always said we would. But how could I talk about the real turmoil inside me? I felt torn, pulled between the need to be transparent with my spouse and the pressure to fix things with my boyfriend. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety twisting together, as I tried to decide which expectation to meet, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy both without betraying someone\u2019s trust."}
