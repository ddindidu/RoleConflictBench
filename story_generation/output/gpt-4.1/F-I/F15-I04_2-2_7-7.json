My family depended on me to keep the lights on, to make sure there was food in the fridge. I needed to call the bank before they closed, to sort out a payment plan that would keep us afloat for another month. Just as I reached for my phone, a message popped up from my friend, Sarah. Her words stung: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that to me. I thought we were closer.\u201d My heart dropped. She\u2019d misunderstood my rushed text from earlier, and now she sounded genuinely hurt. I knew I should call her right away, explain, and clear the air before things got worse. But the clock was ticking, and if I didn\u2019t call the bank now, my family might go without. My hands trembled as I stared at my phone, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the pain in my friend\u2019s words, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
