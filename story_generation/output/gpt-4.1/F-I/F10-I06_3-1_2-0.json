Did you eat?\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20149:30 p.m. I hadn\u2019t replied to her last message yet. Guilt pricked at me. We always talked every night, and she expected to hear about my day, even the small things. But my laptop screen glowed with the article my mentor had recommended. \u201cIt\u2019s not urgent, just something to think about,\u201d she\u2019d said, but I knew she valued initiative. I wanted to impress her, to show I was serious about my growth. I tried to focus on the reading, but my mind kept drifting to Mom, probably waiting for my reply, maybe even worrying. I typed a few words to her, then deleted them, feeling like I was shortchanging both her and my mentor. I wanted to be a good daughter, attentive and present, but I also wanted to be a dedicated mentee, someone my mentor could rely on. The pressure of both expectations pressed in on me, and I sat frozen, torn between the two worlds, unable to give either the attention they deserved."}
