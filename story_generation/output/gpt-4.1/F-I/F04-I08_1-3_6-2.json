I\u2019d invited him because I wanted us to spend more time together, to show him he was welcome in my world. But as the night went on, I found myself drifting toward my own group of friends, trying to keep conversations light and easy. That\u2019s when I saw an acquaintance, Sarah, sitting alone on the porch, her shoulders shaking as she wiped away tears. I knew I should go over, offer a kind word, maybe just sit with her for a while\u2014after all, that\u2019s what a decent person would do. But then I caught my brother\u2019s eye again; he looked lost, out of place, and I remembered my promise to include him, to make him feel like he belonged. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which role I should step into first."}
