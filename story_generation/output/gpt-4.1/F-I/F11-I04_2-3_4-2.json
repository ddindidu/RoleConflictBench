It was Mia, my closest friend, calling me in tears. She could barely speak, her voice shaking as she told me her father had just been rushed to the hospital. My heart twisted\u2014I knew she needed me, needed someone to listen, to just be there for her. But downstairs, I could already hear my parents calling my name, reminding me how important tonight\u2019s dinner was. It was the first time in months our whole family would be together, and I knew how much it meant to them, especially to my mom. I stood frozen at the top of the stairs, phone in hand, torn between the warmth and laughter waiting for me in the dining room and the desperate, broken voice of my friend on the other end of the line. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, wishing I could be in both places at once."}
