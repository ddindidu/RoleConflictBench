I knew Mrs. Kim from next door would be annoyed\u2014she\u2019d already left a note last week about the noise. I felt a knot in my stomach, knowing I should do something to keep the peace. At the same time, I could hear my stepdad sighing in the kitchen. He\u2019d been quiet all evening, and I remembered Mom telling me he\u2019d had a rough day at work. I wanted to check in, to ask if everything was okay at home, like I always tried to do. But if I left the dog alone, he\u2019d keep barking and probably upset the neighbors even more. If I stayed to calm the dog, I\u2019d miss the chance to support my parents when they might need me. I stood in the hallway, torn between the closed kitchen door and the leash hanging by the entrance, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
