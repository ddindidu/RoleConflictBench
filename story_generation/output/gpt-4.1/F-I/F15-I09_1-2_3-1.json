She was fidgety, distracted, and I could feel my patience thinning. Just then, the doorbell rang. I peeked through the window and saw Mrs. Lee, our new neighbor, holding a small cake and smiling warmly. I remembered my own plan to welcome her, to be the friendly neighbor everyone appreciates. But my daughter, still sulking from my earlier correction, clung to my leg and whispered that she didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone. I felt torn\u2014should I pause this important lesson and greet Mrs. Lee with the warmth she deserved, or should I stay focused on guiding my daughter, risking coming off as cold or unfriendly? My mind raced, caught between the expectations of being a good parent and a welcoming neighbor, both roles demanding my full attention at the same moment."}
