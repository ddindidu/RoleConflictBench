I kept an eye on him, as Mom always asked, making sure he didn\u2019t wander too close to the curb or get distracted by his phone. That was my job as his stepbrother\u2014look out for him, keep him safe. But my phone buzzed again, a string of messages from my girlfriend lighting up the screen. She was upset about our weekend plans, thinking I\u2019d forgotten, and wanted to talk it out right now. As her boyfriend, I was supposed to resolve things quickly, not let misunderstandings fester. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my brother was skipping ahead, almost at the crosswalk, and my girlfriend\u2019s texts were getting more insistent. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart pounded as I tried to decide: do I call out to my brother, or do I stop and text my girlfriend back? Both needed me, but I couldn\u2019t figure out how to be what they each expected at the same time."}
