My father began his usual toast, and I could feel the warmth of tradition wrapping around us. My phone buzzed quietly in my pocket. I knew it was a message from work\u2014my colleague had mentioned she\u2019d send over some information today. She\u2019d said there was no rush, but I also knew the unspoken expectation: we\u2019re all supposed to be responsive, even after hours, to show we\u2019re engaged and reliable.\n\nAs my family laughed and shared stories, I felt the weight of my phone pressing against my leg. I wanted to be present, to honor the family values my parents had instilled in me, especially during these rare moments together. But a part of me worried that if I didn\u2019t at least acknowledge the message soon, I\u2019d be seen as less committed at work. My mind raced, torn between the comfort of tradition and the pressure to meet professional expectations, both sides silently demanding my attention."}
