He\u2019d just snapped at his little sister, and I knew I needed to step in, to teach him about kindness and respect\u2014values I promised myself I\u2019d instill. But my phone buzzed again, the screen lighting up with messages from my project group. The conflict with my teammates had escalated, and our deadline was slipping away. My mentor had always told me to be proactive, to communicate any issues before they became crises. I could almost hear his voice urging me to send that email, to explain the situation before it was too late. But my son\u2019s eyes were on me now, waiting for my guidance, needing my attention. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my responsibility as a father to shape my child, and my duty as a mentee to be honest and accountable. My heart pounded as I sat between the two, torn by the demands of those who depended on me most."}
