The school had just called\u2014my son was caught bullying a classmate, and they wanted me to come in for a meeting tomorrow morning. I felt a wave of disappointment and worry, knowing how important it was to be there for him, to show him that his actions had consequences and that I cared enough to help him make things right. But then I glanced at the suitcase by the door, a stark reminder that this was the last weekend before my boyfriend left for his new job overseas. We\u2019d planned a special day together, just the two of us, to make memories before months apart. He\u2019d been looking forward to it, and so had I. Now, I felt torn in two\u2014my son needed me, but so did my partner. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I could feel the anxiety rising as I tried to figure out how to be the parent my child needed and the girlfriend my partner deserved, all at the same time."}
