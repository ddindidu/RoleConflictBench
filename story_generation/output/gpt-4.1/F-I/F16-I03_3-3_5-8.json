As a spouse, I was expected to help make the house spotless\u2014my partner\u2019s relatives were arriving soon, and everything had to be perfect. The list of chores seemed endless, and my partner\u2019s anxious glances reminded me of the pressure to get it all done together. But my phone kept lighting up with messages from my girlfriend. We\u2019d had a terrible argument last night, and now she was threatening to end things if we didn\u2019t talk it through immediately. She needed me to listen, to resolve the conflict, to prove that our relationship mattered. I felt torn in two, guilt gnawing at me from both sides. If I left the chores, I\u2019d let my spouse down and risk a family disaster. If I ignored my girlfriend, I might lose her for good. My heart pounded as I stared at the suds, paralyzed by the impossible demands, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
