As a step-parent, I knew I had to make sure the home loan repayment was ready in two months. The weight of that responsibility pressed on my chest. My partner\u2019s child needed stability, and I promised myself I\u2019d provide it. But as a boyfriend, things were unraveling. We\u2019d argued three times this week about money\u2014how much to save, what to spend, who should cut back. She wanted reassurance, compromise, and for me to listen, but every conversation left us both raw and frustrated. I could feel her pulling away, expecting me to fix things, to bridge the gap between us. I wanted to be the partner she needed, but the pressure to keep the family afloat kept me up at night. My mind spun with what I owed to her child, to her, and to myself. I stared at the bills, heart pounding, torn between preparing for the loan and reaching out to her to make peace, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both at once."}
