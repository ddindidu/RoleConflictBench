I knew I should call him back, remind him about behaving in public, about respect and discipline\u2014lessons I promised myself I\u2019d teach him. Just as I opened my mouth, I heard my acquaintance, Mark, beside me, lowering his voice. \u201cDid you see what Sarah did at work? She really messed up that project. I don\u2019t know how she still has her job.\u201d \n\nI felt a jolt. I didn\u2019t want to encourage gossip, but Mark was looking at me, expecting a response. At the same time, my son nearly knocked over a stack of cereal boxes, drawing annoyed glances from other shoppers. I could feel the weight of both moments pressing on me: the need to guide my child, to be the father who teaches right from wrong, and the pressure to respond to Mark without joining in his negativity. My mind raced, torn between correcting my son and handling Mark\u2019s comment with integrity, both roles demanding my attention, both expecting something different from me."}
