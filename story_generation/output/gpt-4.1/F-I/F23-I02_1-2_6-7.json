My stepson\u2019s hopeful eyes flashed in my mind\u2014he\u2019d been counting down the days to his promised Nintendo. I\u2019d told him I\u2019d get it this weekend, and I could already picture his excitement. But my girlfriend\u2019s words from last night echoed louder: \u201cWe can\u2019t keep spending like this. We need to talk about priorities.\u201d We\u2019d argued about money three times this week, and I could feel the tension simmering between us. As a step-parent, I wanted to keep my promise and make the boy feel secure, but as a boyfriend, I knew I needed to help resolve our financial disagreements, not make them worse. My heart twisted, caught between the need to provide joy for my stepson and the responsibility to support my girlfriend. I stared at the bill, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
