I knew how much this meant to her, to all of us. But as I tried to focus on the ceremonial script, my phone buzzed with a reminder about the project deadline. My mentor had always emphasized the importance of transparency\u2014\u201cIf you hit a wall, let me know right away,\u201d she\u2019d said. Yet, the technical problem I\u2019d hit was complicated, and I hadn\u2019t found the courage or time to reach out. The weight of both roles pressed on me: my family needed me to honor our heritage, while my mentor expected honesty and initiative. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between sending a message to my mentor and practicing the ceremonial lines. The expectations from both sides felt impossible to meet at once, and I could feel the tension building inside me, unsure which responsibility to face first."}
