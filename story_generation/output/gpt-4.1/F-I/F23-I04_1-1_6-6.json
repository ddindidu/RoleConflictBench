My stepson\u2019s hopeful face flashed in my mind\u2014he\u2019d been talking about the Nintendo for weeks, and I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d get it today. But the price tag made my stomach twist; money was tight, and I knew I should be careful. At the same time, my phone vibrated again. It was my friend, texting about our meeting spot. We\u2019d had a misunderstanding earlier, and I knew if I didn\u2019t clear it up now, it might turn into something bigger. I felt pulled in two directions: the expectation to provide for my family, to keep my promise and make my stepson happy, and the need to be a good friend, to communicate openly and not let things fester. My heart pounded as I stared at the Nintendo in the window and the unread message on my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
