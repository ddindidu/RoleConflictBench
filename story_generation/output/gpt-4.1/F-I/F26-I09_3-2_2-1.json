I wanted to make a good impression\u2014after all, being friendly and welcoming is important in a neighborhood like ours. Just as I wrapped the cake, my phone buzzed. It was my granddaughter, her voice trembling. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? I really need your advice about something important.\u201d I could hear the worry in her words, and I knew she was reaching out because she trusted my experience and guidance. My heart ached to be there for her, to listen and help her through whatever was weighing on her. But at the same time, I glanced at the clock and realized the neighbors would be expecting me soon. I felt torn\u2014my granddaughter needed me, but I also didn\u2019t want to seem rude or unfriendly to the new neighbors. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood in the hallway, cake in hand, phone in the other, unsure which door to open first."}
