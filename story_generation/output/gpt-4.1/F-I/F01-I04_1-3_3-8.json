The living room was already filling with laughter as my grandchildren tumbled across the carpet, and my daughter called from the kitchen, \u201cDad, can you help set the table?\u201d This family gathering had been on the calendar for weeks, and I knew how much it meant to everyone\u2014especially to me. I wanted to be present, to listen to my grandson\u2019s stories and share in the warmth that only family can bring.\n\nBut as I reached for the plates, my phone buzzed with a message from Mark. The words stung: \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you felt that way.\u201d My heart sank. I remembered the offhand comment I\u2019d made yesterday, meant as a joke, but clearly it had cut deeper than I\u2019d intended. Mark and I had always prided ourselves on honesty, and I knew I needed to call him now, to apologize and clear the air before the misunderstanding grew.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. My family expected me to be fully present, to cherish these moments. But my friend needed me, too\u2014needed my honesty and care. The pull between these two worlds left me standing, phone in hand, uncertain which door to walk through first."}
