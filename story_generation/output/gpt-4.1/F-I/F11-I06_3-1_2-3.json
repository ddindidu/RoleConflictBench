I really need you right now.\u201d I could hear the heaviness in her words, and I knew she was struggling. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, no matter what. But as I started to type a reply, my email pinged\u2014a reminder from my mentor to reach out if I had any questions, no matter how small. I did have a question, a minor one about some terminology in my project, and I knew my mentor valued prompt communication. I felt the pressure to be the reliable mentee, to show I was engaged and proactive. But my sister needed me, and I couldn\u2019t ignore her. My heart pounded as I stared at both screens, torn between being the supportive sister she counted on and the responsible mentee my mentor expected. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I didn\u2019t know which to answer first."}
