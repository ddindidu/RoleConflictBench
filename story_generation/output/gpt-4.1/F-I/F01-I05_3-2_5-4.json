The project deadline was looming, and I knew how much they depended on my guidance to navigate the final hurdles. I\u2019d promised them a thorough walkthrough, and I could already picture their eager faces, waiting for the knowledge I\u2019d spent years gathering.

I could hear the unspoken plea in her words, the expectation that I would drop everything to be with them. My heart twisted.
