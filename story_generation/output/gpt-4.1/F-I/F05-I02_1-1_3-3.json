My wife\u2019s been patient, but I know she\u2019s waiting for me to step up, to show I care about the little things that keep our life running smoothly. I promised I\u2019d fold it tonight, and I want to keep that promise.\n\nBut my phone buzzes\u2014a message from my girlfriend, asking if I\u2019m free tonight. She\u2019s been looking forward to spending time together, just the two of us, no distractions. We finally have a few evenings where our schedules align, and she\u2019s excited to make the most of it. I can almost hear her laughter, see her smile, and I want to be there with her.\n\nI feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. If I stay home, I let my girlfriend down. If I go out, the laundry\u2014and my wife\u2019s disappointment\u2014will be waiting for me. My heart tugs in two directions, and I sit there, paralyzed, unsure which part of me to honor tonight."}
