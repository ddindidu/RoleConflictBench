He\u2019d been talking about the Nintendo for weeks, and I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d buy it if I could manage the budget this month. I\u2019d been careful, skipping my own little luxuries, just to make sure I could keep that promise. As I scrolled through my banking app, calculating every cent, my phone buzzed again. It was Lisa, an old acquaintance. Her message was frantic\u2014her car had broken down on a quiet road outside town, and she needed someone to come pick her up. She didn\u2019t know who else to call. I knew she\u2019d expect me to help, and I wanted to be there for her, but the gas money for the trip would eat into the savings I\u2019d set aside for the Nintendo. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the reliable friend, but I also wanted to be the mother who kept her word.
