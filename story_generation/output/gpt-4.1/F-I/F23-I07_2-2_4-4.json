My phone buzzed with a reminder: the report for the team was due in two hours, and I still had a few sections left to polish. I glanced up just in time to see my stepson darting between aisles, giggling as he narrowly missed bumping into an elderly woman. I felt the weight of my responsibility as a step-parent\u2014this was a moment to teach him about respect and discipline, to guide him gently but firmly. But my mind was also with my colleagues, knowing that if I didn\u2019t submit my part on time, the whole project would stall and my teammate would be left waiting. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between stepping in to correct my stepson\u2019s behavior and finding a quiet corner to finish my work. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I stood there, heart pounding, caught between what I owed my family and what I owed my team."}
