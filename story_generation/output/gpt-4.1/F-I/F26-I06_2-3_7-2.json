She wanted to share every detail, her excitement bubbling through each text. As a grandparent, I knew how important it was to be present, to listen, to celebrate these milestones with my family. But my laptop screen glared at me, the unfinished report from my mentor blinking like an accusation. The deadline was tomorrow, and my mentor had made it clear how crucial this assignment was for my growth\u2014and for the upcoming evaluation by upper management. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of family, the pride in being needed, and the pressure of professional expectations, the fear of letting my mentor down. I could hear my granddaughter\u2019s laughter in the background of a voice message, and at the same time, the clock ticked louder, reminding me of the work left undone. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
