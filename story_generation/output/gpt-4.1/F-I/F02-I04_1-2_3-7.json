She was supposed to be learning to eat neatly, and I knew I should gently remind her about table manners, maybe even have a little talk about why it matters. Just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my friend, Mark. He\u2019d misunderstood my earlier text\u2014something about a joke that didn\u2019t land\u2014and his reply was curt, almost hurt. I could feel the tension in his words. I knew if I didn\u2019t call him right away, the misunderstanding might fester, and our friendship could take a hit. But my daughter was looking at me, waiting for guidance, and I could see this was a teachable moment. My mind raced, torn between being the attentive father she needed and the supportive friend Mark expected. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my presence, each too important to ignore."}
