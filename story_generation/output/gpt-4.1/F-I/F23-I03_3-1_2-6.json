My stepson had been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me. I knew I had to be there for him, to show up as a responsible step-parent, to help him understand the seriousness of his actions and support him through the consequences. But just as I was about to call the school back, my boyfriend texted. He was upset about our weekend plans\u2014he thought I\u2019d promised to spend Saturday with him, but I\u2019d forgotten about the school\u2019s family day. Now, with this new incident, I\u2019d have to cancel altogether. He wanted to talk, to resolve things before they festered, and I could sense his disappointment through the screen. My heart twisted as I tried to figure out how to be present for my stepson in this crisis, while also not letting my boyfriend feel neglected or unimportant. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt torn, unsure which role needed me more right now."}
