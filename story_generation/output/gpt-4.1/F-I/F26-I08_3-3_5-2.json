My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she explained the situation\u2014my grandson had fallen ill suddenly, and they needed me at the hospital. My heart clenched; I knew my family counted on me to be there, to offer comfort and strength. I grabbed my coat and hurried out, my mind racing with worry.\n\nAs I reached the street, I saw Mrs. Lee, a neighbor I\u2019d only spoken to a few times, sitting on the bench, her shoulders shaking with sobs. She looked up, her eyes red and pleading. I remembered how she\u2019d always smiled and waved, and I knew she expected me to stop, to listen, to be the friendly face she needed right now. But my family needed me too\u2014urgently. I felt torn, my feet rooted to the spot, my heart pulled in two directions.
