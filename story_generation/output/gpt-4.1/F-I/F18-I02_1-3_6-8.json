She was quiet, her eyes scanning the sidewalk for cracks to avoid. I kept glancing at my phone, waiting for a reply from Mia. My heart pounded with every vibration, knowing our last conversation had ended with her saying, \u201cMaybe we need a break.\u201d I wanted to call her, to fix things, to prove I could resolve our fights like a good boyfriend should. But my sister\u2019s hand slipped into mine, and I remembered Mom\u2019s words: \u201cAlways look out for each other.\u201d \n\nSuddenly, a group of older kids appeared ahead, laughing too loudly, blocking the path. My sister squeezed my hand tighter. I felt the weight of her trust, the expectation to keep her safe. At the same time, my phone buzzed again\u2014Mia\u2019s name lighting up the screen. I could feel the pull from both sides: my sister needing me here, Mia needing me to answer, to not give up on us. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out who needed me more in this moment, torn between being the brother she counted on and the boyfriend Mia wanted me to be."}
