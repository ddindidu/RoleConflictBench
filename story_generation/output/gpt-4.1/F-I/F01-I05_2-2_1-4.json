My mentee\u2019s project deadline was looming, and I knew how much they depended on my guidance to navigate the final hurdles. I wanted to be thorough, to give them every tool I could. Just as I was reviewing my outline, I heard a soft knock. My grandson stood in the doorway, eyes downcast, shoulders slumped. He hesitated, then mumbled, \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you?\u201d I could see the weight he carried, the kind that only a gentle ear and a few words of hard-earned wisdom could lighten. My heart ached to be there for him, to offer the comfort and perspective only a grandfather could. But the clock ticked on, and I felt the pull of my commitment as a mentor, the responsibility to be present and prepared for someone else who needed me. Torn between the structured demands of my mentoring role and the spontaneous, emotional needs of my grandson, I sat frozen, wrestling with which part of myself to honor first."}
