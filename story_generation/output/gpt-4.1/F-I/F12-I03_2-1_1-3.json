I miss you.\u201d I smiled, thinking of our last date, but my husband\u2019s voice from the living room pulled me back. He looked tired, his eyes clouded with worry. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do about the promotion,\u201d he said, searching my face for reassurance. He needed me to listen, to help him sort through his doubts, to be the steady presence he could lean on. I wanted to be there for him, to offer the support he expected, but my mind kept drifting to Alex\u2019s message and the promise of laughter and escape. Both needed me in different ways\u2014one for comfort, the other for connection. My heart twisted as I tried to figure out how to be everything to both, feeling the weight of their expectations pressing in from all sides."}
