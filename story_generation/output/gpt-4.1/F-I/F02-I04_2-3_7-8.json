My wife had just reminded me that the rent was due in three days, and the kids needed new shoes. I knew I had to pick up an extra shift tonight if we were going to make it through the month. As I reached for my phone to text my boss, a message popped up from my friend, Mark. He hadn\u2019t replied to my last joke in the group chat, and now I saw his message: \u201cHey, can we talk? That thing you said earlier really hurt.\u201d My stomach twisted. I remembered the offhand comment, meant as a joke, but I could see now how it might have stung. I knew I needed to call him, to explain, to apologize\u2014he deserved that from me as a friend. But if I didn\u2019t confirm the extra shift right now, someone else would take it, and my family would be short on money again. My thumb hovered over the screen, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the pain I\u2019d caused my friend."}
