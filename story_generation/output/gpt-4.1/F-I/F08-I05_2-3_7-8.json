She wanted to share every detail, and I could hear the pride in her words. As a grandmother, I know how important it is to be present, to listen, to celebrate these milestones with my family. But as I sat at the kitchen table, my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from Maya, my mentee. She was anxious about her upcoming presentation, the one that could open doors for her or close them for good. She needed my guidance, my encouragement, and I had promised to review her slides before her meeting.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected warmth and attention, especially now, and I wanted to be the grandmother who never missed a moment. Yet, Maya counted on me to help her grow, to be the mentor who never let her down. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my full presence, each expectation valid and urgent. I stared at my phone, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, something precious would be left waiting."}
