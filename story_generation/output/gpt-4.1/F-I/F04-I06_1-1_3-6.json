My parents chimed in, eager to plan something we could all do together. I felt their eyes on me, waiting for my input, knowing how much it meant to them that I join in. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my mentor\u2019s open office hours were scheduled for Saturday morning\u2014the only time she was available this week. She\u2019d emphasized how important it was to make the most of these rare opportunities, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. My family expected me to be present, to laugh and bond with them, but my mentor expected commitment and respect for her time. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between being the supportive brother my family wanted and the dedicated mentee my mentor needed. The conversation at the table grew louder, but all I could hear was the clash of expectations, each pulling me in a different direction."}
