The spreadsheet for the client\u2019s project blinked at me, a reminder of the looming deadline. My phone buzzed, and I glanced over to see a message from my daughter: \u201cMom, can you talk to Lily? She\u2019s been really down lately.\u201d I looked up and saw Lily, my granddaughter, shuffling into the room, her shoulders slumped, eyes clouded with worry. I knew she needed me\u2014needed the kind of gentle wisdom only a grandmother could offer. But the clock ticked on, and the project\u2019s completion was on my shoulders. My team was counting on me; the client was waiting. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart torn between the urgent demands of my job and the quiet, aching need of my granddaughter.

I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the strain of being needed in two places at once."}
