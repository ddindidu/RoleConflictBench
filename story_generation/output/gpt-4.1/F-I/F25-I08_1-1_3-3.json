She says it\u2019s important to uphold our family traditions, especially since I\u2019m still learning to fit in. Tonight, as I\u2019m setting the table, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s Jamie, an acquaintance from my art class. She\u2019s in town for just one night and asks if I can recommend a good restaurant nearby. She sounds lost and a little desperate, and I know she doesn\u2019t know anyone else here.\n\nI glance at my stepmother, who\u2019s watching me, expecting me to be present and engaged, not distracted by my phone. I feel the weight of her expectations\u2014be a good step-child, show respect, participate fully. But Jamie\u2019s message tugs at me too. I want to help her, to be the kind of person who\u2019s there when someone reaches out. My mind races, torn between the warmth of the family gathering and the pull of being helpful to someone who needs me. I stare at my phone, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I\u2019m supposed to belong to right now."}
