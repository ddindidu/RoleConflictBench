There\u2019s been an emergency with Mom.\u201d My heart clenched; I knew I had to be there for my family, to comfort them and help however I could. Just as I stood up, my phone buzzed. It was my old friend, Tom. His voice trembled, \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now. Lisa and I had a terrible fight.\u201d I could hear the pain in his words, the kind of pain that only a friend could help ease. I looked at my daughter, her eyes pleading, and then at my phone, Tom waiting for me to answer. Both needed me, both expected me to be present, to listen, to care. My mind raced, torn between the family who needed my strength and the friend who needed my ear. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each pulling me in a different direction, and I stood there, caught in the middle, unsure which way to turn."}
