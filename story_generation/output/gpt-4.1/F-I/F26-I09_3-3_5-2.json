Something serious had happened, and she needed me to come over right away. As a grandmother, I knew my family expected me to drop everything and be there, to comfort and help however I could. I was already reaching for my coat when I remembered the note slipped under my door last night\u2014a noise complaint from the neighbors. The building manager had scheduled a meeting in the lobby, and I was expected to attend, to show I cared about the community and to smooth things over with the others. I could already picture Mrs. Lee\u2019s disappointed frown if I didn\u2019t show up, and the awkward glances from the rest of the floor. My heart tugged in two directions: my family needed me, but so did my neighbors, in their own way. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the elevator to the lobby and the one that would take me to the parking garage."}
