My wife had called earlier, her voice tight with worry, reminding me that we were running low on money for the week. As a father, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down on me\u2014I needed to find a way to stretch every dollar, to make sure my family had what they needed. Just as I was about to cross the street, I saw an old acquaintance sitting on a bench, head in hands, shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. I hesitated. I knew the right thing, as a decent person and a friend, was to stop, offer comfort, maybe even buy them a coffee and listen. But every minute I spent here was a minute I wasn\u2019t hustling for extra work or figuring out how to make ends meet at home. My heart pulled in two directions: the urge to be kind and present for someone in pain, and the unrelenting pressure to be the provider my family needed. I stood there, torn, feeling the expectations of both roles tightening around me."}
