The house is a whirlwind of activity because my in-laws are arriving in just a few hours, and everything needs to be spotless. My spouse glances at me, eyebrows raised, silently reminding me that the bathroom still needs cleaning and the guest room bed needs fresh sheets. I nod, feeling the weight of shared responsibility pressing on my shoulders.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s my friend, texting in a panic\u2014she\u2019s at the caf\u00e9, but she\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s the right one. We\u2019d had a misunderstanding about the meeting spot, and she\u2019s waiting for me to clarify. I know if I don\u2019t respond right now, she\u2019ll feel abandoned, maybe even hurt, and our friendship could take a hit. But if I stop to text her, I\u2019ll fall behind on the chores, and my spouse will be left to pick up the slack, possibly feeling let down.\n\nI stare at my phone, torn between the urgent demands of my home and the immediate need to reassure my friend, my heart pounding as I wrestle with what to do next."}
