She looked tired, her eyes shadowed, and I knew I should ask her what was wrong. We\u2019d promised each other to talk openly, especially when something was weighing us down. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my team. They were waiting for my response, needing clarification before they could move forward with the project. I could almost feel their impatience through the screen; I\u2019d already delayed longer than usual. My wife sat down across from me, her hands folded, waiting. I could see she needed me to be present, to listen and share. But the pressure from work pulled at me, demanding my attention. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role to step into first, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in from either side."}
