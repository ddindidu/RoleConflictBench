My laptop was open, notes ready, but across from me, my granddaughter looked up with wide, searching eyes. \u201cGrandpa, how did you know what to do when you started your first job?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling with uncertainty. She was about to begin her first internship, and I could see she needed reassurance, maybe even a story from my own past to help her find her footing.\n\nBut the meeting was important\u2014my manager had stressed that today\u2019s updates would be crucial, and missing it would mean falling behind on the project. My colleagues expected me to be present, to contribute, to show I was part of the team. Yet here was my granddaughter, expecting me to be the wise, attentive grandparent, to offer guidance only I could give. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart torn between the demands of work and the needs of family, unsure which voice to answer first."}
