I was supposed to be fully present, laughing at my dad\u2019s jokes and asking my sister about her new art project. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014again. It was Mia, my best friend, and her messages were getting more frantic. She was already at the caf\u00e9, but she thought we were meeting somewhere else. I knew if I didn\u2019t clear things up right now, she\u2019d feel stood up, maybe even hurt. But my mom had just asked me to put my phone away, reminding me how important these family dinners were. I could feel everyone\u2019s eyes on me, expecting me to be part of the conversation, but my mind was split. I wanted to be the reliable sibling, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my friend down. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone under the table, torn between the two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
