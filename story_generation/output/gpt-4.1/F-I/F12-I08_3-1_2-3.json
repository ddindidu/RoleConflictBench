He\u2019d barely spoken all day, his eyes distant, lost in the storm of his crisis. I knew he needed me\u2014needed my words, my touch, my unwavering presence. I wanted to be there for him, to reassure him that he wasn\u2019t alone, that I would help him weather this. My phone buzzed on the nightstand. I glanced at the screen: a message from an old coworker, someone I barely knew outside of work. \u201cHey, can you recommend a good restaurant nearby? I\u2019m meeting someone special tonight.\u201d I stared at the message, feeling the weight of expectation. It was a simple request, but I knew she\u2019d asked because she trusted my judgment, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. But my husband\u2019s grip tightened, his need for comfort pulling me back. I felt torn, the demands of being a supportive wife clashing with the small but real obligation to be helpful to someone who\u2019d reached out. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where my attention should go, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing me from either side."}
