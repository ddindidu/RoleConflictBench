My partner sits curled on the couch, eyes red and distant, barely speaking since the call from her family. She needs me\u2014my arms, my words, my quiet presence. I promised I\u2019d be here, that she wouldn\u2019t have to face this alone. But as I reach for her hand, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s Mrs. Lee from down the hall, her message shaky: \u201cStorm coming. Could you check on me later? I\u2019m worried about the power.\u201d She\u2019s lived alone since her husband passed, and I\u2019ve always told her she could count on me. I glance at my partner, then at the phone, feeling the weight of two promises. My heart aches, torn between the person I love most and the neighbor who trusts me. The storm outside is nothing compared to the one inside me, as I wrestle with who needs me more tonight."}
