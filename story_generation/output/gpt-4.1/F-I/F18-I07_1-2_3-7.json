My younger sister looked at me expectantly, hoping I\u2019d chime in with ideas for our Saturday outing. Mom smiled, waiting for my input, and I knew they wanted me to be present, to show I cared about our time together. But my mind kept drifting to work. My team was waiting for my response to a crucial email\u2014without my clarification, the project couldn\u2019t move forward. I could almost feel the weight of their anticipation through the screen, the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d reply quickly, as I always did. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on my family, but the pressure from work tugged at me. I wanted to be the reliable sibling, fully engaged in our plans, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my colleagues down. The two worlds collided in that moment, and I sat there, torn, unsure which demand to answer first."}
