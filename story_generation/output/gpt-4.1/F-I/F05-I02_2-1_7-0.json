I knew something was bothering her\u2014she\u2019d been quiet all evening. As her husband, I felt the weight of expectation to communicate openly, to ask her about her day, to share my own worries, to be honest and vulnerable. But my phone buzzed with a message from my girlfriend, who\u2019d had a rough day at work. She needed me to listen, to offer comfort, to be her emotional anchor. I felt torn, my mind split between two worlds. My wife needed me to open up, to bridge the growing silence between us. My girlfriend needed me to be strong, to reassure her that everything would be okay. I could feel the tension building inside me, the pressure of being two different people for two different women, each with their own needs and expectations. I stared at my phone, then at my wife, my heart pounding as I tried to decide who needed me more in this moment."}
