I knew I should step in\u2014teach him about respect, about not disturbing others. That\u2019s what a good step-parent does, right? But my girlfriend\u2019s voice, sharp and wounded, cut through my thoughts. \u201cYou never back me up,\u201d she hissed, her eyes red from our argument in the car. We\u2019d been fighting for days, and now she was questioning if we should even stay together. I could see the pain in her face, the expectation that I\u2019d help fix things, that I\u2019d choose her side and smooth over the cracks. But my stepson needed guidance, too, and I felt torn in two\u2014one part of me wanting to kneel down and gently correct him, the other desperate to reach for her hand and promise I\u2019d do better. My heart pounded as I stood between them, paralyzed by the weight of what each of them needed from me."}
