My younger brother trudged in, his shoulders slumped, eyes red. I knew that look\u2014something at school had gone wrong. As his sibling, I felt the familiar tug to be there for him, to sit beside him and let him talk, or just be silent together until he was ready. But before I could even cross the hallway, my phone buzzed. It was my best friend, her name lighting up the screen. I answered, and immediately heard her shaky voice, on the verge of tears, asking if I could talk. She\u2019d just had a huge fight with her partner and needed someone to listen. I glanced at my brother, who was now curled up on the couch, hugging a pillow. My friend\u2019s voice trembled in my ear, desperate for comfort. My heart twisted, torn between the two people who needed me most, both expecting me to be their safe place. I stood frozen, phone in hand, feeling the weight of their needs pressing in from both sides, unsure which way to turn."}
