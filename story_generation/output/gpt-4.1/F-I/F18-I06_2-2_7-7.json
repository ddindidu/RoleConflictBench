He\u2019d been practicing for weeks, but this trick was new and risky. As his older sibling, I felt a knot of worry tighten in my stomach. I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my mentor had carved out a rare fifteen minutes for me, squeezed between her meetings. She\u2019d made it clear how valuable her time was, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. I glanced from my brother, poised at the top of the ramp, to my phone, the meeting link blinking at me. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: be there for my brother, or respect my mentor\u2019s time. I stood frozen, torn between two worlds, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me."}
