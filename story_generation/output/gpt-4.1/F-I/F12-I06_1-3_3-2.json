My husband had already mentioned, twice, that he was running out of clean work shirts. I knew he expected me to help fold and put them away, just as we\u2019d agreed to share the chores. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder from my mentor about the project summary I needed to finish before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation. She\u2019d been clear: this was my chance to prove myself, and she was counting on me to deliver something polished and insightful. My mind raced, torn between the guilt of letting my husband down and the anxiety of disappointing my mentor. I could almost hear both of their voices in my head, each urging me to prioritize their needs. My hands hovered over the laundry basket, but my laptop screen glowed with the unfinished document. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt frozen, unable to move in either direction."}
