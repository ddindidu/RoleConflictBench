She looked up at me, eyes searching for approval, and I knew this was one of those moments where I needed to model calm guidance, to teach her the small lessons that would shape her character. Just then, my phone buzzed insistently. I glanced at the screen\u2014three new messages from my team, all asking for clarification on the project plan. They couldn\u2019t move forward until I responded, and I knew they were waiting, probably growing frustrated with my silence. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be present and nurturing as a parent, and the professional demand to be responsive and reliable as a colleague. I felt the pressure mounting, my heart beating faster as I tried to decide which role needed me more in this moment."}
