My kids would be waiting at the school gate, eyes searching for me among the crowd of parents. I promised them I\u2019d be there, just like every other day. As I grabbed my keys, I noticed the neighbor\u2019s trash bin sitting at the curb, half-empty. Ours was nearly full, and I remembered the conversation last week: \u201cLet\u2019s not overfill each other\u2019s bins without asking, okay?\u201d she\u2019d said, her tone friendly but firm. Trash pickup was tomorrow, and if I didn\u2019t do something, our garbage would pile up for another week. I stood in the driveway, torn. If I quickly added a bag or two to her bin, I could solve my problem, but I\u2019d risk upsetting her and violating our agreement. If I waited to ask, I\u2019d be late picking up my kids, letting them down. My heart pounded as I weighed my children\u2019s expectations against my neighbor\u2019s trust, feeling the pressure of both roles squeezing me from either side."}
