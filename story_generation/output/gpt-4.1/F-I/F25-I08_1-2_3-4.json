I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d I knew Jamie didn\u2019t have many friends in town, and I could almost hear the hope in her words. At the same time, my stepmother had just reminded me about our family\u2019s annual holiday baking day\u2014something she insisted was important for bonding and upholding our family traditions. She\u2019d said, \u201cIt means a lot to your dad and me that you\u2019re there. It\u2019s what families do.\u201d I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. If I skipped baking day, I\u2019d disappoint my stepmother and risk feeling even more like an outsider. But if I turned Jamie down, I\u2019d be letting down someone who genuinely needed help, and I\u2019d feel guilty for not being there for her. My mind spun with anxiety, torn between the family I was trying to fit into and the friend who needed me."}
