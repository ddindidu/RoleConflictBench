I\u2019m really anxious about the storm.\u201d She\u2019s always counted on me, especially since our parents moved away. I promised her I\u2019d be there whenever she needed me, and tonight, she sounded scared. But as I grabbed my keys, I glanced at the hallway window and saw Mrs. Lee\u2019s lights flicker. She\u2019s lived alone since her husband passed, and I know she relies on neighbors for little things\u2014like checking in during bad weather or picking up her mail. I remembered the neighborhood group chat: \u201cPlease check on elderly neighbors tonight.\u201d I felt torn. My sister needed me, but so did Mrs. Lee. If I left now, I might not be able to help her if the power went out. My heart pounded as I stood in the doorway, keys in hand, wrestling with the weight of being both a brother and a neighbor, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
