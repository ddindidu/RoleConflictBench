Rent is due next week, and groceries are running low. My son\u2019s shoes have holes, and I promised him new ones. I know I need to pick up an extra shift at the caf\u00e9 this weekend\u2014my manager already hinted there\u2019s work if I want it. The money would help, even if it means another twelve-hour day on my feet.\n\nBut then there\u2019s Alex. He\u2019s leaving for Singapore on Monday, gone for months. He\u2019s been planning this weekend for us\u2014just the two of us, no distractions, no responsibilities. He keeps texting me about the picnic, the movie, the late-night walk. I see the hope in his messages, the need for reassurance that we matter, that I\u2019ll miss him.\n\nI feel pulled in two directions, my chest tight. My son needs security, shoes, food. Alex needs my time, my presence, my love. I want to be there for both, but I can\u2019t see how. The weight of their expectations presses down, and I sit at the kitchen table, phone in hand, unable to choose."}
