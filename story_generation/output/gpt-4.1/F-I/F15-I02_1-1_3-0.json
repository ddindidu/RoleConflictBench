She was supposed to say \u201cplease\u201d before I handed her the cereal, but she just reached out, impatient. I knew I needed to remind her\u2014this was one of those moments to teach her about manners, about respect. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mia: \u201cRough day. Can we talk?\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words, and I knew she needed me to listen, to be present for her, to offer comfort.\n\nMy daughter\u2019s eyes met mine, waiting for my response, while my phone vibrated again, insistent. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my daughter needed my guidance, my partner needed my support. I could feel the tension knotting in my chest, the pressure to be the parent who shapes a good person and the boyfriend who\u2019s always there. I hesitated, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
