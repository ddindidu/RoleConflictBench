My spouse and I had agreed to split the chores evenly today\u2014relatives were coming over, and the house had to be spotless. I could hear the vacuum running in the living room, a reminder that I needed to finish my part before my spouse finished theirs. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was an acquaintance from work, texting, \u201cHey, do you know any good restaurants nearby? I have guests in town and need a quick recommendation.\u201d I knew they relied on me for local tips, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. But my hands were dripping with soapy water, and I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014my spouse would be frustrated if I got distracted, and the chores wouldn\u2019t get done in time. I stared at the phone, torn between the expectation to be a supportive partner at home and a helpful acquaintance to someone reaching out. My heart pounded as I weighed which role needed me more in this moment."}
