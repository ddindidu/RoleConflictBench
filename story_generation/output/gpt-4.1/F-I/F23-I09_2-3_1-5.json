Today was the open class at Lily\u2019s school, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there. As her step-parent, I knew how much it meant to her that I show up, to prove I cared, to be present in a way her own parent sometimes wasn\u2019t. But as I poured my coffee, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the HOA inspection was this morning, too. Our neighbor, Mrs. Kim, had already warned me that the bikes and boxes in the corridor could get us all in trouble. She expected me, as a responsible neighbor, to help clear the space before the inspector arrived. I could almost hear her voice, tight with worry, about fire codes and fines. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between Lily\u2019s hopeful face and the silent, expectant eyes of my neighbors. I felt the pressure mounting, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and that no matter what I chose, someone would be disappointed."}
