My wife texted me this morning, worried about groceries and the rent due next week. As a father, I know I have to find a way to bring in more money, maybe by asking for extra shifts or cutting back on things we enjoy. Just then, I spot Mark, an acquaintance from another department, coming toward me. He\u2019s always friendly, and I know he expects a smile or a quick chat. But my head is spinning with numbers and worries, and I\u2019m not sure I can muster the energy to be approachable right now. I feel the pressure to be polite and maintain a good relationship at work, but all I want to do is retreat into my thoughts and figure out how to support my family. As we draw closer, I can feel the tension inside me, torn between the demands of being a reliable father and a friendly acquaintance."}
