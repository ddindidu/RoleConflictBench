I had to get to work early, maybe even ask for extra shifts, just to make sure we\u2019d have enough for the week.

She smiled warmly and said, \u201cGood morning!\u201d I knew she expected a friendly chat, maybe a few kind words, but my head was full of bills and worries. I felt the pressure to be polite, to not let my stress show, but all I wanted was to keep moving, to get to work and secure what my family needed. My heart pounded as I hesitated, torn between stopping to be the good neighbor and rushing off to be the responsible parent."}
