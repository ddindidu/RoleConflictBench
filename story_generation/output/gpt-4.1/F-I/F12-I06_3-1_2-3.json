My husband was in the living room, his shoulders hunched, eyes red from another sleepless night. He needed me\u2014he\u2019d said as much, his voice trembling, asking if I could just sit with him, maybe talk, maybe just be there. I wanted to be that steady presence, the person he could lean on, especially now when everything seemed to be falling apart for him.\n\nBut my mentor had always emphasized the importance of open communication, even about small things.
