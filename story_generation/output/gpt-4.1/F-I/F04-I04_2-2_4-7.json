Come join us!\u201d The smell of my mom\u2019s cooking drifted through the house, and I knew everyone was waiting for me. As the oldest brother, I was expected to be there, to laugh, to ask about everyone\u2019s day, to be present. But my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from my best friend, Sam. He\u2019d misunderstood my earlier text, thinking I was annoyed with him, and his reply was sharp, hurt. I could feel the tension in his words, and I knew if I didn\u2019t call him right now, things might get worse. My family expected me at the table, but Sam needed me to clear things up, to be the friend who doesn\u2019t let misunderstandings fester. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of my family and the urgency of my friend\u2019s feelings, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
