The first message was from Mom, asking if I\u2019d eaten dinner yet and reminding me to send her a photo of my meal, as I always do. The second was from Maya, my best friend, who wrote, \u201cUgh, today was endless. Can I vent?\u201d I stared at the screen, feeling the familiar tug-of-war inside me. Mom expected me to reply right away, to keep up our daily ritual of sharing every little detail, and I knew she\u2019d worry if I didn\u2019t. But Maya\u2019s message was urgent in a different way\u2014she needed me to listen, to be present and supportive, not distracted or half-hearted. I could already imagine her disappointment if I took too long to answer or seemed distant. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my heart pounding as I tried to figure out how to be the attentive daughter my parents counted on and the caring friend Maya needed, all at the same time."}
