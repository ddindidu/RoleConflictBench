My grandson, Ethan, messaged first, his words heavy with worry: \u201cGrandpa, can I talk to you? I really need your advice about something important.\u201d I could hear the uncertainty in his voice even through the text, and I knew he was counting on me to listen, to share the kind of wisdom only a grandfather can offer. Just as I was about to call him, my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, knocked on my door. She was leaving for a week and reminded me about the packages she expected, especially with the planned power outage. \u201cCould you please keep an eye out? I\u2019m really counting on you,\u201d she said, her eyes anxious. I felt the weight of both their needs pressing on me\u2014Ethan\u2019s need for guidance, Mrs. Lee\u2019s trust in my reliability. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between being the steady hand for my grandson and the dependable neighbor for Mrs. Lee. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, wrestling with which role to answer first."}
