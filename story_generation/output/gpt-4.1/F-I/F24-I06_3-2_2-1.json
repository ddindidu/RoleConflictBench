My mentor\u2019s email echoed in my mind: \u201cLooking forward to seeing your code sample at our next meeting.\u201d I knew how important it was to show progress, to prove I was serious about learning. But just as I started to type, I heard muffled sobs from the hallway. My stepbrother, Alex, had just found out his best friend was moving away. He\u2019d barely spoken since the news, and I could feel the weight of his sadness pressing through the walls.\n\nI wanted to be there for him, to sit beside him and listen, like we promised we would when things got hard. But the clock was ticking, and the code wasn\u2019t going to write itself. My chest tightened as I stared at the screen, torn between the urge to comfort Alex and the pressure to meet my mentor\u2019s expectations. I could hear his crying grow louder, and my fingers hovered uselessly over the keyboard, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
