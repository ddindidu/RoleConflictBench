My parents chimed in, asking if I\u2019d be able to join, and I could see how much it meant to them. I nodded along, trying to match their enthusiasm, but my mind kept drifting back to the technical problem I\u2019d hit earlier in the day on my internship project. My mentor had always emphasized the importance of reaching out as soon as I hit a roadblock, and I knew I should email her tonight to explain the issue. But the thought of excusing myself from the family conversation, or even missing the hike to catch up on work, made my stomach twist. I wanted to be the supportive sister, present and involved, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my mentor down or fall behind. The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure which role to prioritize."}
