The team meeting was in fifteen minutes, and the agenda was packed with crucial project updates. My manager had stressed the importance of everyone\u2019s input, and I knew missing it would mean being out of the loop on decisions that would affect my work for weeks. But then my phone buzzed: a reminder that today was my turn to pick up the kids from school. They\u2019d be waiting at the gate, scanning the crowd for my face, hoping I\u2019d be there like I promised. I could picture their disappointment if I wasn\u2019t. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be a reliable colleague and the promise I\u2019d made as a father. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my team counting on my presence, my children counting on my love. I stared at my calendar, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I\u2019d have to let down."}
