I knew I needed to teach him about respect and discipline, to gently but firmly correct his behavior before it spiraled. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket\u2014a message from my mentee, desperate for advice about a job offer that could change her life. She was waiting for my guidance, expecting me to help her weigh the pros and cons, to be present and thoughtful in my response. My heart pounded as I watched my son weave dangerously close to a display of glass jars, while my mind raced with the responsibility I felt toward my mentee\u2019s future. Both needed me, right now, in completely different ways. I felt torn, the weight of being a good mother and a reliable mentor pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
