My daughter\u2019s open class at school was tomorrow evening\u2014the one she\u2019d been talking about for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play, asking if I\u2019d be there in the front row. At the same time, it was the only evening my girlfriend and I had free before she left for a week-long work trip. She\u2019d been hinting at a special dinner, just the two of us, to reconnect before her schedule swept her away.\n\nI could already hear my daughter\u2019s hopeful voice, \u201cWill you come, Dad?\u201d and see her searching for me in the crowd. But I also remembered the look in my girlfriend\u2019s eyes last night, the way she squeezed my hand and said, \u201cI miss us.\u201d Both needed me, both deserved my time. My chest tightened as I imagined letting either of them down. I wanted to be the parent who never missed a moment, and the boyfriend who made her feel cherished. But I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The weight of their expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, unable to choose."}
