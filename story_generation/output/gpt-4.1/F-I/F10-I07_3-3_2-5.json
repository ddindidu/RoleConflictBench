I knew she was waiting for my usual lunchtime call, eager to hear about my day and share her own stories. We\u2019d always kept this routine, and I could already imagine her worry growing with each minute I didn\u2019t respond.

If I missed the deadline, the whole team would be in trouble. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between typing out the final section and picking up the phone.
