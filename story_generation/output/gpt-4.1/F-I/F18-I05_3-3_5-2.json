The holiday trip was a big deal\u2014my parents had planned it for months, and everyone expected me to join, to laugh, to be present. But as I scrolled, another notification popped up: my mentee, Sarah, asking if I could review her application before the midnight deadline. She was on the verge of a life-changing opportunity, and she trusted me to help her make the right choice. My family needed me to be a sibling, to show up and share in our traditions. Sarah needed me to be a mentor, to guide her through a pivotal moment. I felt the pressure mounting, my heart tugged in two directions, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be disappointed."}
