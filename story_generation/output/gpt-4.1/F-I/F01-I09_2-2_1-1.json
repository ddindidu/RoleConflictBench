As his grandfather, I felt the familiar urge to sit beside him, offer a story from my own tangled youth, and remind him that storms do pass. But just as I reached for the door, the bell rang. It was the new neighbor, smiling nervously, holding a small cake wrapped in a checkered cloth. She\u2019d just moved in and wanted to introduce herself, her eyes searching mine for warmth and welcome. I knew the right thing was to invite her in, chat a while, and make her feel at home\u2014after all, that\u2019s what good neighbors do. Yet, my heart tugged me toward my grandson, who needed me now more than ever. I stood there, torn, the neighbor\u2019s hopeful smile on one side and my grandson\u2019s silent plea on the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
