She sighed, mentioning a tense meeting with her boss, her voice light but her eyes tired. I knew she wanted me to listen, to offer comfort, maybe just a hug or a few gentle words. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from Sam, my mentee. He was stuck on a project, asking if I had a moment to help him think it through. I could hear the hope in his words\u2014he relied on my guidance, and I\u2019d promised to be there when he needed advice. My wife looked at me expectantly, waiting for a response, while my phone vibrated again. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of their needs pressing on me. I wanted to be present for both, but I could already feel the tension rising in my chest, unsure which role to step into first."}
