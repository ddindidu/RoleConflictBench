My kids would be finishing school in twenty minutes, and I\u2019d promised to pick them up today. They always looked for me at the gate, their faces lighting up when they spotted me. I didn\u2019t want to let them down, not after missing last week\u2019s art show. But just as I was about to excuse myself, I noticed Mark, an acquaintance from work, standing awkwardly with a newcomer at the gathering. The new guy looked lost, barely speaking, and Mark caught my eye, silently asking for help to break the ice. I knew how important it was to be welcoming, to make someone feel included, especially in a new environment. My mind raced\u2014should I stay a few more minutes to help, risking being late for my kids, or leave now and possibly seem cold or uninterested? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
