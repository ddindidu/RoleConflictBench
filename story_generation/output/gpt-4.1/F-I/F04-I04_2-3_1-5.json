His car had broken down on the side of the highway, and he sounded scared, asking if I could come pick him up right away. I grabbed my keys, ready to rush out the door, when I heard muffled sobs from my sister\u2019s room. She\u2019d been having a rough week, and tonight was especially hard for her\u2014she needed someone to talk to, someone to just sit with her. As her brother, I knew she counted on me to be there, especially when she was feeling this low. But Mark was stranded, alone and anxious, and I was the only person he trusted to call. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the desperate plea of my friend and the silent pain of my sister. Both needed me, both expected me to be there, and I felt the weight of letting one down no matter what I chose."}
