She wanted to make sure I\u2019d be there, that I\u2019d call my grandson tonight to talk about his school play. Family time was sacred, especially during the holidays, and I knew how much it meant to everyone that I stayed connected. But as I waited for the elevator, Mrs. Lee from down the hall approached, her face tight with concern. The noise complaint had everyone on edge, and as her neighbor, I was expected to be calm, friendly, and understanding\u2014maybe even mediate if things got tense. She started to talk, her voice low, and I felt the weight of her expectation to listen and respond with patience. My mind raced between the warmth of my family\u2019s anticipation and the immediate need to be a good neighbor. I could feel the tension rising inside me, torn between the pull of my family\u2019s traditions and the demands of neighborly civility, unsure which role needed me more in that moment."}
