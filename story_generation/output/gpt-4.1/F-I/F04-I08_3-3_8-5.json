We\u2019d argued the night before, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d talk things through with him today\u2014no more silent treatment, just honest conversation to rebuild the respect we\u2019d always had. But the message flashing on my screen was from Mark, a guy I knew from work. \u201cCar broke down. Stuck on Oak Lane. Can you help?\u201d I could picture him stranded, anxious, maybe even a little embarrassed to ask for help. I knew what it felt like to be in that spot, and I\u2019d always believed in being there for people when they needed it.\n\nBut my brother was waiting inside, probably pacing, maybe even rehearsing what he\u2019d say. I\u2019d told him I\u2019d be there at six sharp. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting him down again, risking another misunderstanding, another crack in our relationship. But if I ignored Mark, I\u2019d be turning my back on someone who\u2019d reached out in a moment of need. My hand hovered over the doorknob, my phone still buzzing, my mind torn between two promises I didn\u2019t want to break."}
