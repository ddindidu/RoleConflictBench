She looked tired, and I felt that familiar tug of responsibility. \u201cIs everything okay, Mom?\u201d I asked, hoping she\u2019d open up if something was wrong. She smiled, but it didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. I wanted to stay, to make sure she was really alright, to be the support she needed.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was Jamie, an acquaintance from work. Her message was urgent: her car had broken down on a quiet road outside town, and she needed someone to come help. I could almost hear the anxiety in her words. She didn\u2019t have anyone else nearby, and I knew she was counting on me.\n\nI looked at my mom, still lost in her thoughts, and then at my phone, Jamie\u2019s message glowing on the screen. Both needed me, but in completely different ways. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to do, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in from opposite sides."}
