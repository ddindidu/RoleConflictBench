She was leaving for a week and asked if I could keep an eye on her apartment, especially with the planned power outage. She mentioned a package arriving tomorrow, and I promised I\u2019d help. But as I set the phone down, my sister called from the kitchen, reminding me about tonight\u2019s family dinner. Mom had been looking forward to all of us being together, and I knew how much it meant to her. I felt the weight of both promises pressing on me\u2014my family expecting me to be present, laughing and sharing stories at the table, while my neighbor trusted me to look after her place and make sure her delivery was safe. I could already imagine the disappointment in my mom\u2019s eyes if I left the dinner early, and the worry in my neighbor\u2019s voice if I told her I couldn\u2019t help. My stomach twisted as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, torn between being a good sister and a reliable neighbor."}
