Instinctively, my hand shot out, grabbing his backpack to pull him back. My heart pounded\u2014my first thought was to keep him safe, like I always had since we were kids. But then he glared at me, annoyed, and muttered, \u201cI\u2019m not a kid anymore. You don\u2019t have to treat me like one.\u201d \n\nI hesitated, torn. As his sibling, I felt responsible for his safety, but as his mentor, I knew I was supposed to let him make his own choices, even if they were careless. He\u2019d asked me earlier about which internship to pick, and I\u2019d tried to guide him without pushing too hard. Now, I wondered if I was overstepping, blurring the line between protecting him and letting him learn. My mind raced, caught between the urge to scold him for being reckless and the need to respect his independence. I stood there, unsure which role to lean into, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
