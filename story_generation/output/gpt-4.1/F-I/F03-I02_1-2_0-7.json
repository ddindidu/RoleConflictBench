Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d I stare at the screen, guilt prickling at me. I know she worries if I don\u2019t check in, and I promised I\u2019d be better about keeping in touch. But my mind is still tangled in the argument I had with Emily last night\u2014our third this week, all about money and how we\u2019re going to make rent. She\u2019s in the other room, quiet, waiting for me to come talk things through. I know she expects me to step up, to help us find a solution, to not just walk away when things get hard. I want to be there for her, to show her I care, but I also want to reassure my parents, to let them know I\u2019m okay. My thumb hovers over the phone, torn between sending a quick text to Mom or going to Emily to try and fix things. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I can\u2019t seem to move."}
