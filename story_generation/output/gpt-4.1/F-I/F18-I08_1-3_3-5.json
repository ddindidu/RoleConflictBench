My younger sister wanted to go hiking, and my parents were excited about a movie night. I could feel their eyes on me, waiting for my input, and I knew how much it meant to them that I joined in. Just as I was about to suggest a picnic, my phone buzzed. It was Sam, an acquaintance from work. His message was urgent\u2014his car had broken down on a quiet road outside town, and he needed someone to pick him up. He didn\u2019t know many people here, and I was one of the few he could call. I glanced at my family, their faces expectant, and then at my phone, Sam\u2019s message blinking on the screen. The weight of both expectations pressed on me: the warmth of family togetherness and the responsibility to help someone in need. My mind raced, torn between staying and being the sibling my family hoped for, or leaving to be the supportive acquaintance Sam desperately needed."}
