I know how much it means to her that we all gather, hands dusted with flour, laughter echoing through the house. But as I glance out the window, I see Mrs. Patel, my elderly neighbor, struggling to carry her trash bags to the curb. Trash pickup is tomorrow, and our bins are only half-full\u2014there\u2019s plenty of space for her bags. I remember the unspoken rule in our neighborhood: be considerate, don\u2019t overfill the bins, respect each other\u2019s boundaries. My mother calls again, and I feel the weight of her expectation to honor our family\u2019s traditions. At the same time, I can\u2019t ignore the tug of responsibility to be a good neighbor, to help Mrs. Patel without crossing any lines. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the kitchen\u2019s warmth and the cold night outside, wrestling with the demands of being both a dutiful daughter and a considerate neighbor."}
