The home loan repayment loomed over me, just two months away, and I needed to double-check every expense, every possible way to save. My mind raced with worries\u2014school fees, groceries, the electricity bill. I knew I had to be careful, to make sure nothing slipped through the cracks. Just as I was about to review the budget again, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my friend, sounding confused about where we were supposed to meet later. She\u2019d been upset lately, and I knew this was my chance to clear the air, to be the friend she needed\u2014someone who communicates, who doesn\u2019t let misunderstandings fester. But my hands hovered over the phone, torn. If I stopped now, I might lose my train of thought, miss something important in the budget. If I ignored her, I risked letting our friendship drift further apart. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each too important to neglect."}
