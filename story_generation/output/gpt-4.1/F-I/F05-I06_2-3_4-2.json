But my phone buzzes again\u2014another message from my mentor, checking in on the progress of the report I\u2019m supposed to finish before tomorrow\u2019s big evaluation. The pressure in my chest tightens. If I let my mentor down, I risk my reputation and the trust I\u2019ve worked so hard to build. If I let my wife down, I break a promise and add to her stress, knowing she\u2019s counting on me. I glance between the laptop on the kitchen table and the laundry basket by the door, feeling pulled in two directions. My mind races with the weight of both expectations, and I can\u2019t shake the guilt that, no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
