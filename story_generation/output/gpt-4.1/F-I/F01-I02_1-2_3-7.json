Saturday was circled in red\u2014family gathering at my daughter\u2019s house. My grandson had called me twice this week, excited to show me his new model train. I could already picture his face lighting up when I walked through the door. My daughter had gently reminded me, \u201cDad, it means a lot to the kids when you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nBut my phone buzzed again. It was her\u2014my girlfriend. We\u2019d argued three times this week about money, about how we split things, about what\u2019s fair. Her last message was short: \u201cWe need to talk. Tonight?\u201d I could feel the tension in my chest. She expected me to show up, to listen, to help us find a way through this mess. I wanted to be there for her, to prove I could be the partner she needed.\n\nI sat in my quiet kitchen, torn between the laughter of my family and the hope of mending things with her. Both sides needed me, both sides expected me to show up. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of being pulled in two directions, not sure which part of my heart to follow."}
