My heart pounded as I read the message again: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted to meet with me this afternoon. As a parent, I knew I needed to be there, to show my son that his actions had consequences and to support him through this difficult moment. I imagined his anxious face, waiting for me to walk through the school doors.\n\nBut just as I was about to call the school back, my mentee\u2019s email popped up. She was preparing for a crucial interview that could change her career, and she needed my guidance today. She\u2019d been working so hard, and I\u2019d promised to help her practice. As her mentor, I felt responsible for her growth and success. I could picture her, nervously waiting for my advice, counting on me to help her shine.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed down on me. My child needed me as a parent, my mentee needed me as a mentor. I sat at my desk, torn, the clock ticking, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
