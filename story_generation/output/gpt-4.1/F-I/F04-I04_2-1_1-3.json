He\u2019d been quiet all day, and Mom mentioned he seemed down after a tough exam. I knew he needed me, maybe just to sit with him or listen. But then my friend Sam\u2019s name flashed on the screen. \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m losing my mind with this IKEA thing,\u201d he texted. I could almost hear the frustration in his words. Sam had always been there for me, especially last month when I was stressed about my internship. I owed him.\n\nBut my brother\u2014he rarely asked for help, and I could sense he was struggling. I felt torn, standing in the hallway, phone in hand. If I ignored Sam, I\u2019d let down a friend who counted on me. If I put off my brother, I\u2019d miss a rare chance to be there when he actually needed support. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, caught between two people who both expected me to show up for them."}
