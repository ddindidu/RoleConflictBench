She mentioned a tense meeting at work, her voice light, almost dismissive. As her husband, I knew she valued open communication, so I asked a few gentle questions, trying to draw her out. She shrugged, insisting it was nothing, and changed the subject. I let it go, not wanting to push.\n\nLater that evening, my phone buzzed. My girlfriend had received harsh feedback at work and was clearly upset, her messages full of frustration and self-doubt. As her boyfriend, I felt the urge to be there for her, to offer comfort and reassurance. She needed me to listen, to validate her feelings, to be her emotional anchor.\n\nBut as I typed out a supportive reply, I glanced at my wife, who was quietly folding laundry, her earlier words echoing in my mind. Was I failing her by not pressing further, by not being the open communicator she expected? Was I giving too much of my emotional energy elsewhere? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding a different part of myself, and I sat there, torn, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
