My phone buzzed with a message from my partner: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you promised Jamie the Nintendo today. He\u2019s been counting down the days.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014if I left now, I could make it to the store before it closed. But the task for the client was still unfinished, and the deadline was tomorrow morning. My manager had stressed how crucial this delivery was, how the whole team was depending on me to keep the project on track. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. Jamie\u2019s hopeful face flashed in my mind, the trust he\u2019d placed in me as his step-parent, the promise I\u2019d made. But I also thought of my colleagues, the late nights we\u2019d all put in, and the risk of letting everyone down. My heart pounded as I sat frozen, torn between keeping my word to Jamie and fulfilling my responsibility to my team."}
