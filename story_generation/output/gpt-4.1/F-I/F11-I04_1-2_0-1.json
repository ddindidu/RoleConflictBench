She was glowing with pride, and I knew how much this day meant to her\u2014and to me, too. We\u2019d promised to always be there for each other, especially for big moments like this. Just as we were about to bring out the cake, my phone buzzed. It was my best friend, her name flashing on the screen. I answered, and immediately heard the tears in her voice. She\u2019d just had a huge fight with her partner and needed someone to talk to\u2014someone to listen, right now. I could hear the pain in her words, and I knew how much she counted on me to be there for her, to listen and help her through tough times. My heart twisted as I looked at my sister, waiting for me to join the celebration, and then at my phone, my friend\u2019s voice trembling. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by the people I cared about most, each needing me in a different way at the exact same moment."}
