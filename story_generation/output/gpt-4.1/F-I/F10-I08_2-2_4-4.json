We all need to be together for the family ceremony. It\u2019s tradition.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation. Our family had always taken pride in honoring our customs, and lately, everyone seemed even more insistent that we not let anything interfere. Just as I was about to leave for my room, my phone buzzed. It was Maya, an acquaintance from my art class. \u201cHey, I know it\u2019s last minute, but could you help me move some boxes on Saturday? I don\u2019t have anyone else to ask.\u201d I stared at the message, torn. Maya sounded desperate, and I knew how hard it was for her to reach out. I wanted to help, to be the kind of person others could rely on. But the thought of disappointing my family, of breaking a tradition they held so dear, made my stomach twist. I sat there, phone in hand, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I could bear to let down."}
