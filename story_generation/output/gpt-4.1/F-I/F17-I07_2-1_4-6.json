My mother was explaining, for the third time this week, how important it was to attend the family dinner tonight. \u201cIt\u2019s tradition,\u201d she said, her eyes searching mine for reassurance. I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation settle on my shoulders. At the same time, my phone screen lit up with a new email from a colleague. The subject line was simple: \u201cFYI\u2014No action needed.\u201d Still, I knew the unspoken rule at work: respond promptly, show you\u2019re engaged, even if it\u2019s just a quick acknowledgment. My family wanted me present, attentive, honoring our customs. My team expected me to be responsive, reliable, always connected. I stared at the phone, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s traditions and the silent pressure of my professional world, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first."}
