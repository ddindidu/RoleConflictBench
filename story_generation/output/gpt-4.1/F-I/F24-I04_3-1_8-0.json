It was Mia, my best friend, texting me about how awful her day had been. She needed someone to listen, and I knew she counted on me to be there for her, especially when she was feeling down. As I started typing a reply, I noticed Ethan drifting ahead, earbuds in, not paying attention. He stepped off the curb, about to cross the street, and I saw a car coming fast around the corner. My heart pounded. I was supposed to look out for him\u2014Mom and Dad always said we had to take care of each other. But Mia\u2019s messages kept popping up, her words growing more desperate. I felt torn, my fingers frozen above my phone, my eyes darting between Ethan and the screen. I could only do one thing at that moment, but both needed me in different ways."}
