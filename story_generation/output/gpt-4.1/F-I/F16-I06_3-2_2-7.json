My partner\u2019s eyes were red, their voice trembling as they recounted the latest blow in a string of bad news. I could feel their need for me\u2014my presence, my words, my arms around them. I wanted nothing more than to stay, to be the anchor they needed right now. But my phone buzzed again: a reminder for the meeting my mentor had squeezed into a jam-packed schedule. She\u2019d made it clear how valuable her time was, and I\u2019d promised to be prompt and prepared. I glanced at the clock, my heart pounding. If I left now, I\u2019d make it. If I stayed, I\u2019d be the partner I wanted to be. My partner\u2019s hand found mine, squeezing tight, silently pleading for me not to go.
