It was just a routine catch-up, nothing urgent, and I knew it would be recorded for anyone who missed it. Still, as a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute, to show that I valued the team\u2019s time. But as I glanced over the screen, I saw my grandson sitting on the porch, shoulders slumped, eyes fixed on the ground. He\u2019d been quiet all morning, and I could sense something was weighing on him. As his grandfather, I felt a deep responsibility to offer guidance, to share some of the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years, to let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. The meeting was about to start, but my heart was already outside with him. I felt torn, the expectations of my colleagues pulling me one way, the needs of my grandson tugging me another. I sat there, wrestling with the choice, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
