My family was bustling around, preparing for our annual tradition of sharing stories and cooking together. My mother called me to help with the dumplings, a task she always entrusted to me, saying it was my way of honoring our family\u2019s heritage. I knew how much it meant to her, to all of them, that I was present and engaged, upholding the rituals that tied us together.\n\nBut in my room, my mentor\u2019s email blinked on my laptop screen. She\u2019d suggested a stack of articles to read, not mandatory, but she\u2019d hinted that discussing them soon would help me grow. I respected her deeply and wanted to show my commitment, to prove I was serious about my development. The thought of disappointing her, of falling behind, gnawed at me.\n\nAs laughter echoed from the kitchen, I felt torn. My family expected me to be fully present, to honor our traditions. My mentor expected me to be proactive, to seize every opportunity. I stared at the dumpling dough in my hands, my mind wrestling with the weight of both worlds."}
