My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind from this morning: \u201cCan you please fold the laundry today? I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d I promised I would, and I meant it. But now, as I open my laptop, a new email pings from my teammate, Mark: \u201cHey, just checking if you\u2019ll have the report ready by 5? I need it to finish my part tonight.\u201d The deadline is tight, and I know if I don\u2019t deliver, the whole project will stall. I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in. If I fold the laundry, I\u2019ll be a good partner, but I\u2019ll let my team down. If I finish the report, I\u2019ll be a reliable colleague, but I\u2019ll break my promise at home. My hands hover over the keyboard, my eyes flicking between the laundry and the screen, heart pounding as I wrestle with what to do next."}
