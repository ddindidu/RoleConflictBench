He grinned at me, asking if I thought he could land the new trick. As his sibling, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014should I warn him about the risks, maybe even tell him not to try? I wanted to keep him safe, but I also didn\u2019t want to crush his confidence.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. A group chat with some acquaintances was blowing up. They were dissecting every move our mutual colleague had made at work, speculating about her motives. One acquaintance messaged me directly, asking for my opinion. I knew the expectation: don\u2019t gossip, don\u2019t add fuel to the fire. But I also didn\u2019t want to seem aloof or judgmental by refusing to join in.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions\u2014my brother\u2019s hopeful face on one side, the pressure of the group chat on the other. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be a good sibling and a respectful acquaintance at the same time."}
