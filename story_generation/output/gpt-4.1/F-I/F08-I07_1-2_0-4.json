The spreadsheet deadline loomed\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish my part tonight, the whole project would stall, and I knew how much my teammate was counting on me. Just as I started typing, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandma, can I call you? I need advice about starting high school.\u201d My heart squeezed. She rarely reached out like this, and I knew how much she valued my guidance. I wanted to be the wise, supportive grandmother she expected, to listen and help her feel confident about this new chapter. But the clock ticked, and the pressure from work gnawed at me. If I stopped now, I\u2019d be letting my colleague down, risking the team\u2019s progress. I stared at the phone, torn between the urgent needs of my work and the emotional needs of my family, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
