He was upset\u2014apparently, I\u2019d forgotten to confirm our weekend plans, and now he felt overlooked. I could sense the tension in his words, and I knew he expected me to smooth things over, to reassure him that he mattered. Just as I started typing a reply, my granddaughter wandered in, her eyes uncertain. She hesitated, then asked, \u201cGrandma, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d Her voice was soft, searching for the kind of wisdom she believed I always had. I wanted to give her my full attention, to offer the guidance she needed, but my phone kept vibrating insistently. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the gentle trust in my granddaughter\u2019s question, and the urgent need to resolve the tension with my boyfriend. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing on me, each demanding my presence, each too important to ignore."}
