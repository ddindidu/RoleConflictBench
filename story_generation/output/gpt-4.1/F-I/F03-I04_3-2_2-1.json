She\u2019d asked for a quick update on my day, as she always did, and I knew she\u2019d worry if I didn\u2019t answer soon. But before I could type a word, my friend\u2019s name flashed on the screen. I answered, and immediately heard the strain in his voice. \u201cHey, do you have a minute? I really need to talk,\u201d he said, his words shaky. He\u2019d just had a fight with his partner, and I could tell he needed me to listen, to be there for him like I always promised I would.\n\nBut as he started to talk, my phone vibrated again\u2014another message from my mom, asking if everything was okay. I felt the pressure mounting. My parents expected me to keep them in the loop, to reassure them with quick, thoughtful replies.
