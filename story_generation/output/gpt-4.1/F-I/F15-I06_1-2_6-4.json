But the price tag made my stomach twist; with bills piling up, I wasn\u2019t sure if I could justify the expense. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cProject update due.\u201d I was stuck on a technical issue, and my mentor had always encouraged me to reach out early if I hit a wall.
