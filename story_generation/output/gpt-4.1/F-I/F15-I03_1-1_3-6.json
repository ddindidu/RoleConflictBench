It was a message from Alex, my boyfriend, about our weekend plans. He sounded upset, thinking I\u2019d forgotten our date. I glanced at my son, who was fidgeting and not paying attention to his math problems. I knew I needed to remind him gently about focusing and being respectful during study time\u2014teaching him discipline and good manners was important to me. But Alex\u2019s texts kept coming, each one a little more frustrated, and I felt the pressure to reply and clear up the misunderstanding before it grew into a real argument. My son looked up at me, waiting for guidance, while my phone vibrated insistently in my hand. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014wanting to be the patient, attentive parent my son needed, and the understanding, communicative girlfriend Alex expected. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat there, caught between the demands of the people I loved most, unsure which need to answer first."}
