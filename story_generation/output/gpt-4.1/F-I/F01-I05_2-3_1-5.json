The project deadline loomed, and I knew any misstep could cost the company dearly. My phone buzzed, and I glanced up to see my grandson shuffling into the room, eyes downcast. He hesitated, then sat across from me, silent but clearly troubled. As a grandfather, I felt the urge to set aside everything, to offer him comfort and the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. But as a mentor, I was expected to be fully present for my mentee, to review every detail and ensure nothing was overlooked. My mind raced\u2014should I close my laptop and listen to my grandson, or focus on the critical guidance my mentee needed? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my undivided attention, and I felt torn, caught between the needs of my family and my professional responsibility."}
