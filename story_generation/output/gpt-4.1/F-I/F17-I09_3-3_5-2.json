My parents had asked me to lead the family\u2019s annual blessing ceremony, a tradition passed down for generations. They expected me to recite the prayers perfectly, to show respect for our ancestors, and to set an example for my younger cousins. I could see the pride in my mother\u2019s eyes, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. But as I rehearsed the words in my head, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mrs. Lee, our neighbor. She wanted to talk in the lobby about the noise complaint that had been circulating. I knew I had to be polite and understanding, to show the friendliness our building was known for. But the ceremony was starting soon, and my family was counting on me. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my family and the need to be a good neighbor. I could feel the expectations pressing in from both sides, and I stood frozen in the hallway, unsure which door to open first."}
