Dad barely spoke at dinner, his eyes fixed on the window, lost in thought. I knew they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure them, to just be present. But as I sat there, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the project report for work was due soon. It wasn\u2019t urgent, and my colleagues could manage without it for a bit, but I\u2019d promised to get it done early. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, praising my reliability. My parents needed comfort, but my team expected consistency. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides. I wanted to be the daughter who could ease my parents\u2019 worries, but I also wanted to be the colleague who never let the team down. My heart ached as I sat between the two worlds, unsure which one needed me more right now."}
