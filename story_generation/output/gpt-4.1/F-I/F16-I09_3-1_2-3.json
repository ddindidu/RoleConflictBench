Their eyes are red, voice barely above a whisper as they recount the day\u2019s anxieties. I know how much they need me right now\u2014steady, attentive, present. I nod, squeeze their hand, and try to offer the comfort they seek. But in the back of my mind, I remember the trash bins outside. Tomorrow is pickup day, and our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, has asked me several times not to put out half-full bins, saying it\u2019s wasteful and inconsiderate. She\u2019s sensitive about the shared curb space, and I promised I\u2019d be mindful. \n\nNow, I feel the weight of both promises. My partner\u2019s pain tugs at me, urging me to stay, to listen, to be the anchor they need. But the clock ticks closer to midnight, and if I don\u2019t take out the trash soon, I\u2019ll miss the pickup\u2014and risk upsetting Mrs. Lee again. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the urge to slip away for just a moment, torn between being the spouse my partner needs and the neighbor I promised to be."}
