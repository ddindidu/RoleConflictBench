At the same time, my granddaughter slid into the chair across from me, her eyes wide with uncertainty. \u201cGrandma, how did you know what to do when everything in your life started changing?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. I could see she needed reassurance, a steady hand to guide her through her confusion. But my mind kept drifting to the technical problem I hadn\u2019t solved yet, the one I was supposed to report to my mentor. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my granddaughter expecting wisdom and calm, my mentor expecting honesty and progress. My heart ached to be fully present for her, to offer the comfort she sought, but anxiety gnawed at me, reminding me of my responsibility to communicate my struggles at work. I wanted to be the wise grandmother she needed, but also the reliable mentee my mentor counted on. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding my attention, and I sat there, torn, unsure which need to answer first."}
