My mom had texted twice already, reminding me not to be late, and I knew how important it was for her that I show up and try to bond with my new family. As I hurried down the street, I spotted Maya, a girl from my literature class, sitting on a bench with her head in her hands, shoulders shaking. I hesitated, remembering how she\u2019d always been friendly to me, and how I\u2019d promised myself to be more approachable and supportive to people around me. I could see she needed someone to talk to, and I felt the pull to sit beside her, to ask if she was okay, to be the kind of acquaintance who doesn\u2019t just walk by. But my phone buzzed again\u2014my stepbrother asking where I was. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me, unsure which part of myself I was supposed to honor in that moment."}
