As a grandfather, I felt the urge to offer him comfort, to share a story from my own tangled youth, hoping it might help him find his way. I could see he needed someone to listen, to guide him gently through whatever storm he was facing. But just as I was about to speak, I remembered the neighbor\u2019s words from earlier: \u201cLet\u2019s not put the bins out unless they\u2019re full. We should be mindful of space and the collection schedule.\u201d The trash bins were only half-full, but tomorrow was pickup day, and if I didn\u2019t put ours out tonight, we\u2019d be stuck with overflowing garbage for a week. I could hear my grandson\u2019s quiet sigh, feel the weight of his need for me, but I also knew the neighbor would be watching, expecting me to respect our agreement. I sat there, torn, the porch light flickering above us, caught between the wisdom my grandson needed and the consideration my neighbor expected."}
