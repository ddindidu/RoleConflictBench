I could already picture my grandkids\u2019 faces, the way they\u2019d light up when I walked in with a bag of old board games.\n\nBut as I closed the call, my work email pinged. A message from my project manager: \u201cNeed your section of the report by Sunday morning. Client\u2019s delivery depends on it.\u201d I knew the task was critical\u2014if I missed the deadline, the whole team would be held up, and the client would be disappointed. My colleagues were counting on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down.\n\nI felt the pressure building in my chest, torn between the laughter of my grandchildren and the silent, urgent demands of my inbox. Both sides needed me, both expected me to show up. I sat at my desk, heart heavy, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
