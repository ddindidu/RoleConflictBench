My wife was sitting on the couch, scrolling through her phone, but I could tell something was off. She looked up and sighed, \u201cWork was a bit much today. Nothing huge, just\u2026 exhausting.\u201d I knew she wanted me to sit with her, listen, maybe offer a hug or a few words to help her unwind. That\u2019s what I always try to do\u2014be present, supportive, her safe place after a long day.\n\nBut my mind was already racing through the agenda for the meeting. This was the last chance to voice concerns before the project plan was set in stone. My team expected me to be there, to contribute, to show I cared about our work as much as they did. I could feel the pressure building in my chest, torn between the warmth of the living room and the cold glow of my laptop screen. I wanted to be the husband she needed, but I also couldn\u2019t let my colleagues down. I stood there, caught in the hallway, heart pounding, unsure which way to turn."}
