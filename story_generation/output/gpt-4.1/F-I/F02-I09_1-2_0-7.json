My kids would be waiting at the school gate, eyes searching the crowd for me, just like every other day. I promised them I\u2019d be there, and I could already picture their faces lighting up when they spotted me. But as I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed with a weather alert: a severe storm was rolling in tonight. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, who lived alone just down the hall. She always asked me to check in on her during bad weather, and I knew she\u2019d be anxious about the storm. I could see her frail hands trembling as she peered out her window, hoping someone would stop by. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014my children\u2019s expectant faces on one side, Mrs. Lee\u2019s vulnerability on the other. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the pull of family and the quiet responsibility of being a good neighbor, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me as the first drops of rain began to fall."}
