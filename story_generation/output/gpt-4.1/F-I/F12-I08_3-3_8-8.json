We were discussing our finances, and he pressed me for complete honesty\u2014he wanted to know if there was anything, anything at all, that could affect our plans. I knew he expected me to be open, to share everything, no matter how uncomfortable. But just yesterday, an acquaintance confided in me about a mutual friend\u2019s financial troubles\u2014details that, if revealed, would explain some of the oddities in our own accounts. My husband deserved transparency, but my acquaintance trusted me not to spread what she\u2019d told me, especially since it could damage someone\u2019s reputation. My mind raced, torn between my loyalty as a wife and my responsibility as a trustworthy acquaintance. I could feel the pressure mounting, my heart pounding as I weighed the consequences of each choice, knowing that whatever I said\u2014or didn\u2019t say\u2014would have lasting effects."}
