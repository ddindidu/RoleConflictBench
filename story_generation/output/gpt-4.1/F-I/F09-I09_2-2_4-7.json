I knew I had to stop him\u2014teach him about respect, about not disturbing others. That\u2019s what a good mother does, right? But as I opened my mouth to call him back, my phone buzzed. It was a weather alert: the storm advisory for tonight had been upgraded. My thoughts immediately jumped to Mrs. Kim, my elderly neighbor who lived alone just down the hall. She always relied on me to check in, especially when bad weather was coming. I could almost hear her frail voice, \u201cThank you, dear, for thinking of me.\u201d \n\nBut right now, my son was weaving dangerously close to a display of glass jars, and I could see the disapproving glances from other shoppers. I felt torn\u2014should I rush after my son and correct his behavior, or should I call Mrs. Kim to make sure she was prepared for the storm? The weight of both responsibilities pressed down on me, and for a moment, I just stood there, caught between being the mother my son needed and the neighbor Mrs. Kim depended on."}
