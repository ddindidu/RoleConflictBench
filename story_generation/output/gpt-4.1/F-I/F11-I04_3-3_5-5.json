It was Mia, my best friend, her voice shaky and scared. Her car had broken down on the side of the highway, miles from home, and she needed me to come get her right away. My mom called from the hallway, reminding me not to be late for the family dinner before we left in the morning. I could already hear my dad talking about how important it was for everyone to be together, especially since we hadn\u2019t all gathered in so long. But Mia was alone, stranded, and I knew she had no one else to call. My heart pounded as I stared at my suitcase, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the desperate plea of my friend. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both at once."}
