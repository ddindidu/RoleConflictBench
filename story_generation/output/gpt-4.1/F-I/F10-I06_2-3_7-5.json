I knew they were both under a lot of pressure at work, and lately, they seemed to lean on me more, sharing their worries and looking for comfort. I wanted to be there for them, to listen and reassure them that things would get better. But my phone buzzed with another message from my mentor, asking for an update on my project. The truth was, my teammates and I had hit a wall\u2014arguments and misunderstandings had stalled our progress, and I was supposed to let my mentor know about any issues right away. I could almost hear her voice in my head, reminding me that open communication was key to growth. My parents needed me to be present, to offer support, but my mentor expected honesty and responsibility. I felt torn, my chest tight with worry, unsure which need to answer first."}
