I\u2019ve done the last three loads.\u201d I promised I would, and now, after a long day, I finally have a moment to tackle it. Just as I reach for the first shirt, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s my friend, Sarah. \u201cHey, are you free for a quick video call? I\u2019m losing my mind with this IKEA dresser.\u201d I know she\u2019s been having a rough week, and she rarely asks for help. I glance at the laundry, then at my phone, feeling the pressure build in my chest. My spouse expects me to share the load at home, to keep my word. But Sarah needs me, and I want to be the kind of friend who shows up when it matters. My hands hover, uncertain, as I wrestle with the pull of both roles, knowing that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
