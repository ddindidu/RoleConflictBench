It\u2019s our routine\u2014me updating them on my week, them asking about my job and reminding me to eat well. Today, though, as I\u2019m about to dial, I remember Mrs. Lee next door mentioned she\u2019s expecting an important package. She\u2019s at work, and I promised I\u2019d listen for the doorbell and grab it for her if it comes. I can\u2019t shake the feeling of being pulled in two directions. If I focus on the call, I might miss the delivery and let Mrs. Lee down. But if I hover by the door, distracted, my parents will notice I\u2019m not really present, and I know how much these calls mean to them, especially since I moved out. My phone buzzes with a text from Mrs. Lee: \u201cPackage should come soon\u2014thank you!\u201d I stare at my phone, heart pounding, torn between the family I\u2019m trying to stay close to and the neighborly trust I don\u2019t want to break."}
