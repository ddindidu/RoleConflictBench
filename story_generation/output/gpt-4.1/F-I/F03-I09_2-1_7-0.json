At dinner, my mother barely touched her food, and my father stared at the TV without really watching. I felt the weight of their exhaustion pressing on me, the unspoken expectation that I should be there for them, listen, and offer comfort. As I cleared the table, I heard footsteps in the corridor. Our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, was coming home. She always greeted me with a warm smile, expecting a friendly hello in return. I stepped out to take out the trash, and there she was, waiting for that brief, polite exchange. My mind was still with my parents, replaying their tired faces, but I knew Mrs. Lee would notice if I seemed distant or cold. I felt torn\u2014should I rush back to my parents, or pause and give Mrs. Lee the neighborly kindness she expected? The pressure of both roles squeezed my chest, and I hesitated, caught between the door to my family and the hallway to my neighbor."}
