I knew he expected a quick reply, maybe even a photo of my dinner. That\u2019s how it\u2019s always been since Mom remarried: daily check-ins, sharing every little detail, making sure I\u2019m okay. But tonight, my mind was somewhere else. My boyfriend and I had argued again, the third time this week, about money\u2014who pays for what, how much we should save, whether we\u2019re being fair. He was waiting in the living room, expecting me to come out and talk, to finally resolve things instead of letting them fester. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me: my stepdad\u2019s need for connection, my boyfriend\u2019s need for resolution. I stared at my phone, torn between sending a cheerful update and walking out to face another difficult conversation. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out who needed me more right now, and what I was supposed to do."}
