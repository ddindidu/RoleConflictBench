The home loan repayment is looming, just two months away, and I know I need to get ahead on the bills, maybe pick up extra shifts at work. My son\u2019s school fees are due soon, too. I feel the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest\u2014my family depends on me to keep everything afloat. \n\nBut tonight is the only evening my boyfriend and I have together before he leaves for a week-long business trip. He\u2019s been looking forward to this, texting me all day about the movie he wants to see and the new restaurant he\u2019s found. I can hear the hope in his voice, the expectation that I\u2019ll be present, relaxed, and happy to just be with him. \n\nInside, I\u2019m torn. I want to be the girlfriend who makes him feel special, but the mother in me is anxious, calculating, wondering if I should spend the evening working on our finances or even taking a freelance gig. My heart aches with the pull of both roles, each demanding more than I feel I can give."}
