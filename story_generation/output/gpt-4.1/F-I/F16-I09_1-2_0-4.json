They looked up and gave me a tired smile, mentioning offhand that work had been a bit much today. I could tell they needed me to listen, to be present, to offer the kind of comfort that only I could give. I sat down beside them, ready to be that support, when suddenly our dog started barking loudly in the hallway. I winced, remembering the note our neighbor had left last week about the noise. The barking echoed through the thin walls, and I imagined our neighbor sighing in frustration next door. My partner\u2019s story faded into the background as I debated whether to rush out and quiet the dog, risking my partner feeling brushed aside, or stay and listen, risking another complaint from the neighbor. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between being the attentive spouse my partner needed and the considerate neighbor I was expected to be."}
