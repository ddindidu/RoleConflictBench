I glanced at the screen\u2014my best friend\u2019s name glowed in the darkness. I answered, and immediately heard her sobs. She could barely speak, but I understood enough: something terrible had happened in her family, and she needed me to listen, to be there for her, even if only through the phone. As I sat up, I caught sight of the overflowing laundry basket in the corner of our bedroom. My spouse had asked me earlier that evening if I could help fold the laundry before bed, since it had been piling up for days. I\u2019d promised I would, knowing how much it bothered them to wake up to a mess. Now, I felt torn\u2014my friend\u2019s pain was raw and immediate, but so was my spouse\u2019s need for partnership and reliability. My heart ached as I weighed the silent expectations pressing in from both sides, wishing I could be enough for both of them at once."}
