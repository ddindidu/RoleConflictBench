It\u2019s our ritual, and I know how much it means to them, especially since I moved out. But as I glanced at the clock, my laptop chimed with a calendar alert\u2014our team\u2019s final project meeting was about to start. This was the last chance to voice concerns before the big launch, and my manager had stressed the importance of everyone\u2019s input. I could already picture my parents waiting by the phone, expecting my call, while my team would be watching for my name to pop up in the meeting. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment in my parents\u2019 voices against the pressure from my colleagues. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which expectation I would have to let down."}
