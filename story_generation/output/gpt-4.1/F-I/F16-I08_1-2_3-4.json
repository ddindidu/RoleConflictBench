We agreed to share the chores, and I know it\u2019s my turn to fold. The clothes have been sitting there for days, and I can almost hear the silent disappointment in my partner\u2019s sighs as they walk past the pile. Just as I reach for a shirt, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s Sam, an old acquaintance from college. \u201cHey, could you help me move some boxes this afternoon? I\u2019m really in a bind.\u201d I remember how Sam once helped me out when I was in a tough spot, and I know he\u2019s counting on me now. My mind races\u2014if I leave the laundry, I\u2019ll let my spouse down, but if I say no to Sam, I\u2019ll feel like a bad friend. The pressure builds in my chest as I weigh the expectations on both sides, torn between being a reliable partner at home and a supportive friend outside it."}
