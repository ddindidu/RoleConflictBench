Our argument from last night still hung in the air, unresolved, and now she was questioning if we should even stay together. My chest tightened with the weight of her words, knowing she expected me to step up, to fix things, to show her I could resolve our conflicts. Just then, my grandson wandered in, his eyes uncertain. He asked me how to handle the changes he was facing at school, how to make good choices when everything felt new and overwhelming. He looked to me for wisdom, for calm guidance, for the steady reassurance only a grandfather could give. I could feel the pull from both sides\u2014my girlfriend\u2019s urgent need for resolution, my grandson\u2019s quiet hope for advice. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be a wise, patient grandfather and the demand to be a present, attentive boyfriend. I felt the pressure mounting, unsure how to be both at once, knowing that whatever I chose, someone I loved would be left waiting."}
