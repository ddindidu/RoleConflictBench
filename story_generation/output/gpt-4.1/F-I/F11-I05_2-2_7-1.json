She was struggling with her part of the group assignment, and as her mentor, I was expected to provide clear guidance and regular feedback. My phone buzzed\u2014another message from my younger brother, Sam. He was upset after a disagreement we\u2019d had earlier about his choice of friends. As his sister, I knew I needed to be patient, to listen and respect his perspective, even if I didn\u2019t agree. But Maya\u2019s deadline was looming, and she was waiting for my advice. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the mentor who should be available and proactive, and the sister who should be understanding and supportive. My mind raced, torn between the urge to call Sam and smooth things over, and the responsibility to help Maya succeed. The expectations clashed inside me, each demanding my full attention, and I sat frozen, unsure which role to answer first."}
