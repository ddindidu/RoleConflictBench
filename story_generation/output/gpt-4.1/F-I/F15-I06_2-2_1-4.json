She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the class play and asking if I\u2019d be there to watch. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But just as I was about to close the app, a message from my mentor popped up: \u201cAny updates on the project? Let me know if you\u2019re stuck.\u201d My heart sank. The technical issue I\u2019d hit was bigger than I\u2019d let on, and I knew I should have reached out sooner. My mentor expected transparency and initiative, and I could almost hear his disappointment if I stayed silent any longer. The open class and the project update were scheduled for the same afternoon. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my daughter\u2019s hopeful eyes, my mentor\u2019s trust in my communication. I wanted to be present for both, but the demands pulled me in opposite directions, leaving me torn and anxious, unsure which expectation I would have to let down."}
