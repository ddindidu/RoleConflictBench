He\u2019d called me, voice trembling, and I could hear the pain in every word. As his step-sibling, I knew I was supposed to be there for him, to offer comfort and let him lean on me. I wanted to rush back to his side, to listen and reassure him that he wasn\u2019t alone. But as I turned the corner, I nearly bumped into Sarah, someone I only knew from class. She smiled and slowed, clearly expecting a friendly greeting. As an acquaintance, I was supposed to be approachable, polite, maybe even chat for a moment. My heart pounded with the weight of my stepbrother\u2019s distress, but I could feel Sarah\u2019s eyes on me, waiting for a smile or a simple \u201chello.\u201d I stood there, caught between the urge to be the supportive sibling my family needed and the expectation to be the pleasant acquaintance Sarah expected. My mind raced, torn by the demands of both roles, unsure which part of myself to honor in that moment."}
