I knew I should gently remind him, reinforce those lessons about respect and kindness. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a friend, asking if I could join a small get-together to help welcome a new acquaintance who was reportedly shy and anxious in groups. I pictured myself there, smiling, making light conversation, being the warm, easygoing person everyone expected. But my mind kept drifting back to my son, who needed my attention and guidance right now. I felt torn\u2014should I stay and focus on my role as a parent, patiently teaching my child the values I hold dear, or should I go and fulfill my social obligation, making someone else feel comfortable and included?
