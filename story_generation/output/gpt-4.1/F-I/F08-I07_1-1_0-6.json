The subject line read, \u201cNo rush, just FYI,\u201d but I knew from experience that a timely response was always appreciated, even if not explicitly required. As I glanced at the screen, my granddaughter slid into the chair across from me, her eyes wide and uncertain. \u201cGrandma, how did you know what to do when you started your first job?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. I could see she was searching for reassurance, for the kind of wisdom only someone who\u2019s lived through it could offer.\n\nMy mind tugged in two directions. I wanted to give her my full attention, to share stories and advice that might ease her worries. But the email nagged at me, a silent reminder of my responsibilities as a colleague. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one asking for patience and presence, the other for promptness and professionalism. My heart ached, caught between the urge to nurture and the need to respond, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
