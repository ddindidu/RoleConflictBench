She was struggling with her project deadline, asking if I could review her latest draft tonight. At the same time, my mother was bustling around, setting the table for our annual family dinner\u2014a tradition that meant everyone was present, no exceptions. I could hear my father in the living room, reminiscing about past gatherings, expecting me to join in and uphold the family\u2019s sense of togetherness. My mind raced. As a son, I was supposed to be fully present, honoring our traditions and showing respect for my parents\u2019 values. But as a mentor, I knew Sarah was counting on me for timely feedback, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each expecting my loyalty. I stared at my phone, torn between the warmth of family and the responsibility I felt toward Sarah, feeling the tension knot in my chest as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
