My partner sighs as they pass by, not saying anything, but I can feel the weight of their expectation: it\u2019s my turn to fold. I promised I\u2019d help more, that we\u2019d share the load, and I meant it. But my phone buzzes again\u2014another reminder from my mentor. The task they assigned is due before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation, and I know how much they\u2019re counting on me to deliver. I want to prove myself, to show I\u2019m reliable and ready for more responsibility. My mind races, torn between the home I\u2019ve built and the future I\u2019m chasing. I can\u2019t shake the guilt, knowing that whichever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down. My hands hover over the laundry, but my eyes drift to my laptop, the cursor blinking impatiently. The clock ticks on, and I feel the pressure mounting, caught between two worlds that both need me right now."}
