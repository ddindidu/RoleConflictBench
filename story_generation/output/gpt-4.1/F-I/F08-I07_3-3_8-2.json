It was a message from my daughter: \u201cGrandma, can you call? It\u2019s urgent. Mom\u2019s not okay.\u201d My heart clenched. I knew my daughter wouldn\u2019t reach out unless it was serious. As a grandmother, I\u2019ve always promised to be there, to listen, to support my family no matter what. But as a colleague, I was expected to be present and engaged\u2014this meeting would determine the direction of our project for the next six months, and my input was crucial. I could already see the faces of my teammates waiting for me to log in, expecting my usual thoughtful contributions.
