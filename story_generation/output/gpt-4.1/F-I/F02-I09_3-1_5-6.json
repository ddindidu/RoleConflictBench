As his father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to make sure he understood the seriousness of stealing. My mind raced with how to handle it\u2014should I make him apologize to the store manager, or talk to him quietly at home? Just as I was about to address it, my phone buzzed. It was Mrs. Lee from next door, reminding me about her package delivery this afternoon. She was counting on me to receive it, since she\u2019d missed so many before. I promised her I\u2019d be home, but now my son needed my full attention. I felt torn\u2014my neighbor trusted me, but my child needed guidance right now. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, unsure which role to fulfill first."}
