My stepdaughter\u2019s voice echoed from her room, asking if we\u2019d have enough for groceries this week. I promised her I\u2019d figure it out, but my mind was already racing through overtime shifts and side gigs. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mrs. Lee, our elderly neighbor. She was worried about the storm advisory and asked if I could check in on her later, maybe help secure her windows. I glanced at the clock. If I took on the extra delivery shift tonight, we\u2019d have enough for food, but I\u2019d be gone when the storm hit. Mrs. Lee had no one else nearby. My family needed me to provide, but Mrs. Lee needed me to be present. The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, torn between the promise I made at home and the responsibility I felt next door."}
