She didn\u2019t say anything, just trudged to her room. I knew something was wrong\u2014she always tried to hide it, but I could tell. I wanted to go after her, to sit on her bed and listen, like I always did when things got rough at school. But my phone buzzed. It was my girlfriend, reminding me that she was waiting at the caf\u00e9. This was our last weekend together before she left for months, and we\u2019d promised to make every moment count. She\u2019d been looking forward to this all week, and so had I. I stood in the hallway, torn. My sister needed me now, but so did my girlfriend. I could feel the weight of both their expectations pressing down on me, my heart pulled in two directions. I hesitated, keys in one hand, my sister\u2019s closed door in front of me, and my phone lighting up with another message."}
