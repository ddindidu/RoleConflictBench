Every week, I call my stepdad and mom to check in, just like they\u2019ve asked. It\u2019s our routine, a way to show I care and keep the peace in our blended family. I know they\u2019re waiting for my call, probably watching the clock, expecting to hear about my week and to share theirs. But just as I\u2019m about to dial, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from Jamie, my closest friend. She\u2019s upset, thinking I was cold in my last text. Her reply is sharp, and I can feel the hurt behind her words. I know I should call her right now, clear things up before the misunderstanding grows. But if I do, I\u2019ll miss my parents\u2019 call, and they\u2019ll worry or feel neglected. My thumb hovers over the screen, torn between the family I\u2019m trying to belong to and the friend who\u2019s always been there for me. My heart pounds as I wrestle with who needs me more in this moment, feeling like I\u2019m letting someone down no matter what I choose."}
