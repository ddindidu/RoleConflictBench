The school had just called\u2014my son was caught bullying a classmate, and they needed me to come in immediately. I could picture his face, the confusion and fear, and I knew I had to be there for him, to show him right from wrong. But as I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed again. It was a reminder: my mentor, Dr. Lee, had managed to squeeze in a session with me before her flight. She\u2019d made it clear how precious this hour was, how much she expected me to be prepared and present. I\u2019d waited weeks for this chance, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down.
