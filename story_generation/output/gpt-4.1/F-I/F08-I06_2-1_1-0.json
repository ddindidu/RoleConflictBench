Her shoulders slumped, and I could sense the heaviness in her silence. As her grandmother, I felt the urge to reach out, to share a story from my own childhood, to offer comfort and guidance. I knew she needed someone to listen, to help her find her way through whatever was troubling her.\n\nBut in the back of my mind, I kept thinking about the reading my mentor had suggested. The book was thick, the topic dense, and though the deadline was weeks away, I knew I should start now if I wanted to impress her. She expected me to be diligent, to show initiative, to prove I was worthy of her time and wisdom.\n\nI felt torn, caught between the pull of my granddaughter\u2019s unspoken need and the pressure to meet my mentor\u2019s expectations. My heart ached with the desire to be present for my family, but my mind buzzed with the fear of falling short as a mentee. I stared at my granddaughter, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
