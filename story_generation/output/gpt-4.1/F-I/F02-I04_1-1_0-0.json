They always looked for me, their faces lighting up when they spotted me in the crowd. As I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed. It was Mark, my oldest friend. \u201cRough day. Can you talk?\u201d he wrote. I could almost hear the heaviness in his words. Mark rarely reached out like this, and I knew he needed someone to listen, someone to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. I stared at the phone, torn. If I called him now, I\u2019d risk being late for the kids, letting them down on a day they looked forward to all week. But if I left Mark hanging, I\u2019d be failing him when he needed me most. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, feeling the weight of both promises pulling me in opposite directions."}
