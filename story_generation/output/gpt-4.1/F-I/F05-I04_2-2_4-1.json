It was Mark, my closest friend. I hesitated, but answered. His voice was shaky, and I could tell he\u2019d been crying. \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now,\u201d he said. I glanced at the overflowing laundry basket, thinking about how my wife had reminded me this morning that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow. I could hear her in the kitchen, already juggling dinner and homework. I knew she was counting on me to help out tonight. But Mark\u2019s words tumbled out, raw and desperate, and I felt the weight of his need for support. My mind raced\u2014if I stopped now, the laundry wouldn\u2019t get done, and I\u2019d be letting my family down. But if I brushed Mark off, I\u2019d be failing him as a friend when he needed me most. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the two people who needed me in completely different ways, unsure which responsibility to put first."}
