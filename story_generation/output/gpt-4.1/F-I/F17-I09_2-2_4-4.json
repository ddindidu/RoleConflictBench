Don\u2019t forget who you are.\u201d Lately, they\u2019d been reminding me how important it was to greet every neighbor with a warm smile and a few words, just as our family had always done back home. But as I reached the shared door, my dog started barking loudly, startling Mrs. Lee from next door. She frowned, clearly annoyed, and I remembered how she\u2019d asked me last week to keep the noise down, especially in the evenings. I felt torn\u2014should I stop and greet her, risking more barking and her irritation, or hurry past, which would disappoint my family\u2019s expectations? My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between honoring my family\u2019s values and respecting my neighbor\u2019s peace, unsure which part of myself I should listen to."}
