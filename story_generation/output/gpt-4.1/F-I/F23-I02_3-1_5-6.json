My heart pounded as I knelt beside him, remembering all the talks I\u2019d had with him about honesty and respect. I knew I had to address this, to teach him right from wrong, but my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. It was Mia, my girlfriend, texting about our weekend plans. She thought I\u2019d forgotten, and her messages grew sharper, hinting at disappointment and frustration. I could almost hear her voice, expecting me to smooth things over, to be the calm, understanding boyfriend who always made things right. But here I was, torn between guiding my stepson through a lesson he needed and reassuring Mia that I cared about her feelings. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to do the right thing. I took a shaky breath, feeling the conflict twist inside me, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
