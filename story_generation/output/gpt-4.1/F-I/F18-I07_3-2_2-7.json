She had just learned about her job loss, and her eyes were red from crying. I reached for her hand, trying to offer comfort, but my mind kept drifting to the notifications piling up on my work phone. The team chat was lighting up\u2014everyone was waiting for my input on a project detail before they could move forward. I knew they expected a quick response, and the deadline was tight. But my sister\u2019s pain was raw and immediate, and I could feel her leaning on me for support. I wanted to be fully present for her, to listen and reassure her that things would be okay.
