It\u2019s our ritual\u2014my mom expects to hear my voice, to know I\u2019m okay, to share her stories and ask about mine. Tonight, as I dial, my dog starts barking at the sound of footsteps outside our apartment door. The walls are thin, and I know my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, has mentioned before how the noise disrupts her evenings. I try to hush my dog, but he only gets louder, his barks echoing down the hallway.\n\nMy mom answers, her voice warm and expectant. She asks about my week, and I try to focus, but I can hear Mrs. Lee\u2019s door open, her sigh audible even through the wood. I feel torn\u2014my mom wants to talk, to feel connected, but my neighbor expects peace and quiet, especially at this hour. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, can\u2019t meet both needs. My heart pounds as I juggle the phone, the barking, and the guilt pressing in from both sides, unsure which role I should honor in this moment."}
