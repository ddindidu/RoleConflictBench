I knew how much this meant to her, to all of us\u2014keeping our traditions alive, honoring our ancestors. But as I tried to memorize the ceremonial lines, my phone buzzed with a message from Maya, my mentee at work. She was struggling with a project and needed my advice. I\u2019d always promised to be there for her, to share what I\u2019d learned and help her grow. I glanced at the family altar, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed me to be the torchbearer, to show respect and commitment. Maya needed me to be present, to guide her through her challenges. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the gravity of tradition with the responsibility of mentorship, torn between the expectations of home and the needs of someone who looked up to me."}
