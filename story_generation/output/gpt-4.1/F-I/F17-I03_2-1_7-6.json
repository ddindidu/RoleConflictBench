Lately, they\u2019d been working longer hours, and I knew they needed me to be present, to listen, maybe even to make them laugh like I used to. I wanted to sit with them, ask about their day, and show them I cared. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from Alex. We\u2019d just had a silly argument about our weekend plans, but it had spiraled into something bigger. He was upset, and I could feel the weight of his expectation: to talk things through, to fix it, to be the understanding girlfriend he counted on. My heart tugged in two directions.
