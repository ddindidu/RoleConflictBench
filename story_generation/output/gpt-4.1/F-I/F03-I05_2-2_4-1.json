I knew how much it meant to her, to all of them, that I be there\u2014present, engaged, upholding the values passed down through generations. But as I scrolled through my phone, a message from my mentee popped up: \u201cCan we meet this Saturday? I\u2019m really stuck and could use your help before the deadline.\u201d I\u2019d promised to be there for her, to guide her through this tough project, and she was counting on me. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest\u2014my family\u2019s expectations on one side, my responsibility as a mentor on the other. I could feel the tension building, torn between honoring my roots and supporting someone who needed me. My mind raced, searching for a way to be both the son my family wanted and the mentor my mentee deserved."}
