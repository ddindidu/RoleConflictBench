My wife\u2019s voice echoed in my mind from earlier\u2014her tears, her trembling words about how lost she felt after her father\u2019s diagnosis. She needed me, she said, just to sit with her, to hold her hand, to be present. I promised I\u2019d be there, that I\u2019d help her through this. But now, my phone flashed with another message: my girlfriend, reminding me that this was our last weekend together before she left for Europe. She wanted to make memories, to feel close before the distance set in. I could hear the hope in her voice, the expectation that I\u2019d make her a priority, just this once. My chest tightened. I wanted to be the anchor my wife needed, but I also wanted to give my girlfriend the goodbye she deserved. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, torn between two worlds, unable to move."}
