My mentee, Sarah, was anxiously waiting for my call\u2014her big interview was tomorrow, and she needed my advice. I glanced at my son, who was darting between displays, giggling as he weaved dangerously close to a pyramid of apples. As a father, I knew I had to teach him about respect and discipline, to gently but firmly correct his behavior before he caused trouble. But as a mentor, I felt the weight of Sarah\u2019s expectations\u2014she trusted me to help her grow, to be present and supportive at this crucial moment. My heart pounded as I watched my son, torn between the urge to guide him and the responsibility to be there for Sarah. Both needed me, right now, in different ways. I gripped my phone, feeling the pressure mount, caught between the demands of being a good father and a reliable mentor, unsure which role to answer first."}
