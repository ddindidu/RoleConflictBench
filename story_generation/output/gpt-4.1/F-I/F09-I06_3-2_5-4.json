My heart pounded as I knelt beside him, feeling the weight of my responsibility as a mother. I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to guide him with patience and firmness, but my mind was racing with another worry. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014my mentor\u2019s name flashing on the screen. I was already behind on my project, stuck on a technical problem I couldn\u2019t solve alone. She expected me to reach out as soon as I hit a roadblock, but I hadn\u2019t told her yet. I felt torn, pulled between the urgent need to address my son\u2019s behavior and the pressure to be a proactive, communicative mentee. My son\u2019s eyes filled with tears, and I wanted to comfort him, but the thought of disappointing my mentor gnawed at me. I took a shaky breath, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
