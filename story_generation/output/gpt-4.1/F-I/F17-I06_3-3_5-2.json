My parents\u2019 voices echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was to lead the ceremony tonight, just as my grandparents had done. They looked at me with pride, expecting me to honor our traditions and show the younger cousins how it\u2019s done.

I knew how much my mentor counted on me, how this assignment could shape my future.
