My sister had just messaged, \u201cMovie night at my place? Bring Alex!\u201d She always wanted us to include each other, to build that sense of family and respect. But Alex, my boyfriend, was still upset after our argument about splitting rent and groceries. He\u2019d barely spoken to me all week, and I knew he expected me to help resolve things, to talk it out and not just brush it aside.\n\nI could hear my sister\u2019s laughter in my mind, picturing her disappointment if I showed up alone or, worse, didn\u2019t come at all. But I also felt the weight of Alex\u2019s silence, the tension in our apartment, and the unspoken hope that tonight we\u2019d finally sit down and work through our issues. My heart pounded as I typed and erased messages, feeling pulled in two directions\u2014wanting to be the supportive sister who brings everyone together, and the caring girlfriend who doesn\u2019t run from hard conversations. I just sat there, phone in hand, unable to choose which role to let down."}
