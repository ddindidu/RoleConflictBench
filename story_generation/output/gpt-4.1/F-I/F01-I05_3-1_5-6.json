My grandson had gotten into trouble at school, and she needed me to come over, to talk to him, to be the steady hand the family counted on. I could hear the urgency in her voice, the unspoken plea for me to be present, to help guide him through this rough patch. At the same time, my mind kept drifting to my mentee, Sarah. Just yesterday, during our coffee break, I noticed her eyes darting to her watch, her words rushed and scattered. She was falling behind at work, and I knew she needed guidance\u2014someone to help her find her footing before she slipped further. Both needed me, but in different ways. My family expected my warmth and wisdom, my presence in a moment of crisis. Sarah needed my encouragement, my experience to help her grow. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart torn between the people who needed me most, wondering how I could possibly be enough for both."}
