Lily\u2019s got something to show everyone\u2014she\u2019s been practicing for weeks!\u201d I could hear my granddaughter giggling in the background, and my heart swelled. I promised I\u2019d be there, picturing her proud little face as she performed. But as I hung up, I noticed the email from the HOA: inspection today, and anything left in the corridor would be cited. My neighbor, Mrs. Kim, had left her walker and a few boxes outside her door again. She relies on me to help her move them, and I know she can\u2019t do it alone. If I leave now, she might get fined\u2014or worse, the inspector might think I\u2019m careless about our shared safety. I stood in my hallway, keys in hand, torn between the joy of being the grandparent Lily expects and the responsibility of being the neighbor Mrs. Kim needs. My chest tightened as I weighed the disappointment in my granddaughter\u2019s eyes against the worry in Mrs. Kim\u2019s."}
