My father barely spoke during dinner, his eyes fixed on the window, lost in thought. I knew they needed me\u2014just to sit with them, to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. But as I cleared the dishes, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the project report was due tomorrow morning. My part was crucial; if I didn\u2019t finish tonight, my teammate would be stuck waiting, and the whole team\u2019s schedule would unravel. I could almost hear the disappointment in my manager\u2019s voice if I missed the deadline. My parents\u2019 silent plea for comfort pulled at me, but so did the weight of responsibility to my colleagues. I stood in the hallway, torn, feeling the pressure build in my chest, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be let down."}
