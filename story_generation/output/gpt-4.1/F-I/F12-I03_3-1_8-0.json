My husband was across from me, his brow furrowed as we tried to untangle the mess of our finances. He wanted honesty, clarity\u2014he needed me to lay everything out, even the uncomfortable truths about my spending and the debts I\u2019d hidden. I could see the worry in his eyes, the expectation that I\u2019d be open, that I\u2019d help us find a way forward together.\n\nBut my phone kept lighting up with messages from him\u2014my boyfriend. He\u2019d had a rough day at work, nothing catastrophic, just the slow grind of office politics and deadlines. He needed me too, but in a different way. He wanted comfort, reassurance, a gentle ear to listen and soothe. He didn\u2019t want to hear about my problems; he wanted to forget his own for a while.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, my heart pounding with guilt and anxiety. How could I be honest and vulnerable with my husband while also being the calm, supportive presence my boyfriend needed? The weight of their expectations pressed down on me, and I didn\u2019t know which role to step into first."}
