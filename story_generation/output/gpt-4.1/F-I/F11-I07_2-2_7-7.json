He wanted to talk, to clear the air, and I knew I needed to be patient and listen, to show him the respect he deserved as my sibling. At the same time, my work laptop pinged with a flurry of emails from my team. They were waiting for my input on a project detail before they could move forward, and I could almost feel their impatience through the screen. I was expected to respond quickly, to keep things moving, to be a reliable colleague. My brother\u2019s message sat unread, my inbox filled with reminders, and I felt the pressure mounting from both sides. I wanted to be the understanding sister he needed, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my team down. My heart pounded as I stared at both screens, torn between the demands of family and work, unsure which to answer first."}
