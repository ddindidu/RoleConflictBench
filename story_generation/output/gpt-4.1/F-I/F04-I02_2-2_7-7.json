My sister\u2019s text glowed on the screen: \u201cCan we talk? I feel like you\u2019re always taking her side.\u201d I could hear my girlfriend in the kitchen, her voice tense as she called my name. We\u2019d argued again last night about money\u2014how we spend it, how we save it. She wanted to talk things through, to resolve it before it festered. But my sister needed me to listen, to be patient and not judge her choices, even when I disagreed. I felt pulled in two directions. My girlfriend expected me to step up, to fix things between us, but my sister wanted me to just be there, to accept her without trying to change her. My chest tightened as I stared at the wall, wishing I could be the brother she needed and the boyfriend she deserved, but knowing that whatever I did, someone would feel let down."}
