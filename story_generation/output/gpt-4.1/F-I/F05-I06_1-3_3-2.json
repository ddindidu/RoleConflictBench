My wife\u2019s voice echoes in my mind from this morning: \u201cCan you please fold the laundry today? I have to work late.\u201d I promised I would, and I meant it. But now, as I sit with my laptop open, my mentor\u2019s email blinks at me\u2014urgent, highlighted, impossible to ignore. The assignment he gave me is due before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation with upper management, and he made it clear how much he\u2019s counting on me. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, my mind racing between the guilt of letting my wife down and the anxiety of disappointing my mentor. My hands hover over the keyboard, but my eyes drift to the laundry, each unfolded shirt a reminder of my promise. I can\u2019t seem to move, torn between the two worlds, each demanding more than I feel I have to give."}
