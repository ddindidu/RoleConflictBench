I knew I should open up, share the stress that had been building at work, and let them in on the personal concerns gnawing at me. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014honesty, openness, no matter how hard. But just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed. It was a message from an acquaintance, someone I\u2019d only met a few times, asking if I could meet them at the park. They sounded desperate, and when I arrived, I found them sitting on a bench, tears streaming down their face. I felt the weight of their pain and knew I needed to be friendly, approachable, someone they could lean on. But my mind kept drifting back to my spouse, waiting at home, needing me to be present and vulnerable. I felt torn, pulled between the expectation to be emotionally available for my partner and the need to offer comfort to someone who clearly needed a friend. The pressure built inside me, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for both."}
