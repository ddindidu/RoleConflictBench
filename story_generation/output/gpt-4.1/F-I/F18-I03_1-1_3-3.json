My younger brother\u2019s eyes lit up as he suggested a movie marathon, and my parents chimed in with plans for a picnic. I could feel their excitement, and I knew how much it meant to them when I joined in. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from Alex, my boyfriend. He wanted to know which evening I\u2019d like to spend together this week\u2014he was free, and so was I, for once. I could almost hear his hopeful tone through the screen, remembering how we\u2019d promised to make more time for each other. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of family traditions and the pull of nurturing my relationship. I tried to focus on the conversation around me, but my mind kept drifting to Alex\u2019s message. I wanted to be there for everyone, but I could already feel the tension building inside me, knowing that no matter what I chose, someone would be disappointed."}
