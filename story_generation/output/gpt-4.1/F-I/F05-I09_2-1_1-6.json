She\u2019d just told me about the big decision looming at work\u2014whether to take on a risky project that could change her career. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to help her sort through her fears. I wanted to be fully present, to give her the support she deserved. But as she spoke, my phone buzzed with a message from our neighbor, Mrs. Lee. She was expecting an important package today, and she asked if I could keep an eye out for it, since she\u2019d be out all afternoon. I knew how much she relied on me for these small favors, especially after the last time her delivery was stolen. I felt torn\u2014my wife needed my undivided attention, but Mrs. Lee was counting on me too. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself caught between wanting to be the supportive husband and the dependable neighbor, unsure how to be both at once."}
