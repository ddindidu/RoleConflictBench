The home loan repayment loomed over me like a storm cloud, and I knew I had to tighten our budget if we were going to make it through the next two months. Every dollar counted, and I was determined not to let my family down. Just as I was about to double-check the utility bills, my phone buzzed. It was Mark, my old college friend. \u201cHey, man, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m losing my mind with this furniture. The instructions make no sense, and I could really use your help.\u201d\n\nI stared at the phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. Mark had always been there for me, especially during my rough patches, and I knew he wouldn\u2019t ask unless he really needed it. But the thought of losing focus on the loan preparations made my chest tighten. I wanted to be the reliable friend Mark expected, but I also couldn\u2019t afford to let anything distract me from my responsibilities as a father. My thumb hovered over the call button, torn between two parts of myself, each demanding my attention."}
