My mind kept drifting to the home loan repayment looming in two months. As a father, I felt the weight of ensuring my family\u2019s financial stability pressing down on me. Every decision, every late night, was for them. But tonight, my phone buzzed with a message from my mentor: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, the task needs to be ready for upper management\u2019s evaluation tomorrow.\u201d I knew how important this was for my career growth\u2014my mentor had high expectations, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down.\n\nBut as I stared at the numbers, I realized I needed to review our finances, maybe even call the bank, to make sure we\u2019d be ready for the repayment. My heart pounded with anxiety. If I focused on the mentor\u2019s assignment, I might miss something crucial for my family. If I prioritized the loan, I risked disappointing my mentor and jeopardizing my future at work. The demands pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt trapped, torn between being a responsible father and a dedicated mentee, unsure which role to serve first."}
