I felt the familiar tug of my role as her guide, the one who should offer wisdom and help her steer clear of trouble. But just that morning, an acquaintance from my walking group had confided in me about a neighbor\u2019s past mistake\u2014something that, if shared, could color how others saw them. As a friend, I knew I shouldn\u2019t spread rumors or speak ill, but as a grandparent, I wanted to protect my granddaughter, to warn her if she might be at risk. My mind spun with the weight of both roles, the urge to shield her clashing with the promise I\u2019d made to keep a confidence. I looked at her, searching for the right words, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
