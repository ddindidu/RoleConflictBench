The kids are finishing school soon, and I promised I\u2019d be there to pick them up\u2014something I know matters to them, especially after all the changes they\u2019ve been through. But as I reach for my keys, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from my partner, her words shaky and raw. She\u2019s alone at home, barely holding it together after the news about her brother. She needs me, maybe more than ever, to just sit with her, to listen, to hold her hand through the storm of her grief.\n\nMy heart twists. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. If I leave now, I\u2019ll let her down when she\u2019s most vulnerable. But if I stay, the kids will be waiting, scanning the crowd for my face, wondering if I forgot them. Both need me, both expect me to show up, and I feel myself pulled apart by love and responsibility, wishing I could split in two."}
