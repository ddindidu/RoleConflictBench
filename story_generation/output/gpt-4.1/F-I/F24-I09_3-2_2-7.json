He\u2019d just gotten the call about his father\u2019s health, and I knew he needed me\u2014someone to listen, to sit with him in the silence, to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone. That\u2019s what we promised each other when our parents married: to be there, especially when things got hard. But as I reached for his hand, my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Lee, our elderly neighbor. The storm warning had just been announced, and she was worried about her medication delivery. She asked if I could check in on her and maybe pick up her package if it arrived late. I glanced at my stepbrother, then at the phone, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. I wanted to be the sibling he could lean on, but I also knew Mrs. Lee depended on me, especially with her family living far away. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, torn between the comfort my brother needed and the reassurance Mrs. Lee was hoping for."}
