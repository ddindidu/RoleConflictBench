It\u2019s really important.\u201d I could see the worry etched on his face, and I knew he needed more than just a quick answer\u2014he needed my full attention, my stories, my advice. As I turned to sit with him, I heard the familiar jingle of keys in the hallway. Mrs. Lee, my neighbor, was coming down the corridor. She always expected a warm greeting, a friendly exchange, and I knew she\u2019d be hurt if I ignored her. My grandson\u2019s anxious gaze pulled at my heart, but so did the neighborly duty to be polite and present. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
