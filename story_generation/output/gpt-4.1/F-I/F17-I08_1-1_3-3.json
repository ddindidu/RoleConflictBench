My mother was telling me, once again, how important it was to keep our family traditions alive\u2014how every year, we all had to be present, help with the preparations, and share stories from our heritage. I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectations, knowing how much it meant to her that I participate fully and respect our customs.\n\nAt that moment, I glanced at my phone and saw a message from an acquaintance I\u2019d met at work. She was new in town and asked if I could recommend a good restaurant nearby. I knew she didn\u2019t have many friends here yet, and she\u2019d probably appreciate a quick reply, maybe even an offer to join her. I felt torn\u2014my family expected my undivided attention, but I also didn\u2019t want to let down someone who was reaching out for help. My mind raced, caught between honoring my family\u2019s wishes and being the supportive acquaintance I wanted to be."}
