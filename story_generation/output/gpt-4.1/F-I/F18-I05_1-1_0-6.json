My younger brother, slumped on the couch, stared blankly at his notes, his anxiety about tomorrow\u2019s final exam almost palpable. As his sibling, I knew he needed me to sit with him, reassure him, maybe even just listen as he vented his fears. That\u2019s what we always did\u2014leaned on each other when things got tough.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from Maya, my mentee at work. She\u2019d missed another deadline, and during our last check-in, she admitted she was overwhelmed and couldn\u2019t manage her time. As her mentor, I was supposed to help her grow, push her to develop better habits, and not let her off the hook just because things were hard.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. My brother needed comfort, but Maya needed guidance. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and I knew that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, caught between the expectations of being a good sibling and a responsible mentor."}
