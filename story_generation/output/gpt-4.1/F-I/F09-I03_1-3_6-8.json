Our argument from last night still hung in the air, unresolved and raw. He wanted to talk, to fix things before they spiraled further, but my mind kept drifting to the promise I\u2019d made to Jamie. His birthday was tomorrow, and he\u2019d been counting down the days for that Nintendo. I\u2019d set aside the money, but after the unexpected car repair last week, things were tight. I could dip into our savings, but that would mean less security for us, for Jamie\u2019s future. Mark\u2019s words echoed in my head\u2014\u201cWe can\u2019t keep avoiding things. If you care, you\u2019ll make time for us.\u201d But Jamie\u2019s hopeful eyes this morning, asking if I\u2019d remembered, tugged at my heart. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of being a good mother and a loving girlfriend pressing down on me, each demanding more than I felt I had to give. My hands trembled as I stared at the bank app, torn between the needs of my child and the needs of my relationship, unsure which promise I was about to break."}
