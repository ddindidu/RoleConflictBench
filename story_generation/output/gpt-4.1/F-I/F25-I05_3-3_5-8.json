It\u2019s your turn to lead the New Year\u2019s ceremony. Your father would be proud.\u201d Her eyes searched mine, full of hope and expectation. I knew how much this meant to her, to the family\u2014preserving the rituals that made us whole, even if I sometimes felt like an outsider. \n\nMy phone buzzed. It was a message from Jamie, my mentee at work. \u201cCan you review my project tonight? The presentation\u2019s tomorrow.
