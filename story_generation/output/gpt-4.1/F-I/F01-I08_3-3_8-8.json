As a grandfather, I felt the weight of my role\u2014my family expects me to be present, to offer guidance, and to keep everyone connected, especially in times of crisis. Later that day, while chatting with an old friend at the park, he mentioned hearing rumors about a boy at the school, not realizing it was my grandson. He pressed for details, hoping I might know more. As an acquaintance, I know I\u2019m expected not to gossip or speak ill of others, to respect privacy and avoid fueling rumors. But as a grandfather, I feel the urge to defend my grandson, to explain his side, maybe even clear his name. The expectations of both roles pull at me\u2014one demands loyalty and openness with family, the other demands discretion and restraint. I stand there, heart pounding, caught between protecting my family and upholding my integrity as a trustworthy acquaintance, unsure of what to say next."}
