My wife had mentioned this morning that the kids needed clean uniforms for tomorrow, and I\u2019d promised to handle the laundry tonight. It was one of those unspoken agreements we\u2019d settled into\u2014sharing the chores so neither of us felt overwhelmed. But just as I was about to start sorting the clothes, my phone buzzed. A message from my girlfriend: \u201cRough day. Can we talk?\u201d I could almost hear the fatigue in her words, and I knew she needed me to listen, to be present, to offer comfort. \n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing in. If I ignored the laundry, my wife would be disappointed, and the kids would be unprepared. If I delayed responding to my girlfriend, she\u2019d feel alone, maybe even neglected. My mind raced, torn between the practical demands of home and the emotional needs of someone I cared about deeply. I stood there, heart pounding, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
