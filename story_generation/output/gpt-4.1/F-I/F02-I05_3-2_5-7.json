The store manager\u2019s stern gaze bore into me, and my son\u2019s eyes brimmed with tears. As a father, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences, even if it meant seeing him cry or feel ashamed. But my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my mentee was waiting for our scheduled call, desperate for guidance before her big interview tomorrow. She was counting on me to help her grow, to be present and encouraging at this pivotal moment in her career. The weight of both roles pressed down on me. My son needed me to be a firm, loving parent right now, but my mentee needed my undivided attention and support. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
