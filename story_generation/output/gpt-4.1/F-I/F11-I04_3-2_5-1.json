It was Mia, my best friend. Her message was short: \u201cCan you talk? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I could almost hear the tears in her words. I knew she\u2019d just had a huge fight with her boyfriend, and she always turned to me when things got rough. My family, though, had been planning this dinner for weeks. My parents expected me to be present, to laugh and share stories, to help make the evening special. I could see my little brother already waiting for me to join the board game we always played after dinner. But Mia needed me, too. She\u2019d always been there for me, and I knew she was counting on me to listen, to help her sort through her feelings. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the warmth of my family and the pain in my friend\u2019s voice, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
