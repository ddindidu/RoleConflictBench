Miss you!\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014already past noon. I hadn\u2019t replied to her last text from two days ago, and guilt pricked at me. I knew she just wanted to hear from me, to know I was okay, to feel connected. But at the same time, my mentee, Sarah, sat across from me, her brow furrowed as she pored over the project plans. She was about to take the lead on a task that could make or break her career, and she needed my full attention. Every question she asked demanded thoughtful, careful answers. I could see her anxiety, and I wanted to be the mentor she deserved\u2014present, patient, and wise. My phone vibrated again. I felt torn, my mind split between the daughter my parents hoped I\u2019d be and the mentor Sarah needed right now. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat there, phone in hand, heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role to answer first."}
