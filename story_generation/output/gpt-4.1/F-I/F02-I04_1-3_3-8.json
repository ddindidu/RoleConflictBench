I knew this was one of those moments where I needed to be patient, to guide her gently but firmly, to teach her the importance of kindness and respect. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my closest friend, short and cold: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that.\u201d My heart dropped. I suddenly remembered the careless joke I\u2019d made earlier, and guilt washed over me. I knew I needed to call him right away, to explain, to apologize before the misunderstanding grew. But my daughter\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for my response, needing my attention and guidance. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time. My mind raced, caught between the responsibility of being a good father and the urgency of being a good friend."}
