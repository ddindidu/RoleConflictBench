The open class at Mia\u2019s school started in thirty minutes, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks. \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Mom?\u201d she\u2019d asked this morning, her eyes shining with hope. I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But just as I was about to leave, my phone buzzed. It was Alex, my boyfriend. His message was curt: \u201cCan we talk? I\u2019m really upset about what happened with the weekend plans.\u201d I could sense the tension, the misunderstanding that had been brewing since last night. He hated unresolved issues, and I knew he expected me to call and clear things up right away. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the classroom where Mia would be searching for my face and the phone in my pocket, heavy with Alex\u2019s disappointment. My chest tightened as I weighed their needs against each other, feeling the pressure of being the mother my daughter needed and the girlfriend Alex wanted. I closed my eyes, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be let down."}
