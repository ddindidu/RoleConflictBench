Her words were shaky, even through the screen\u2014my grandson was in trouble, and she needed someone to talk to. My heart clenched; I knew I should call her right away, offer comfort, and be the steady presence my family expects from me. As I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, Mrs. Lee from next door appeared, her arms full of groceries. She smiled and greeted me warmly, expecting the usual friendly chat we share every morning. I could see she wanted to linger, maybe talk about her new grandchild or the weather. I felt torn\u2014my family needed me urgently, but I didn\u2019t want to seem cold or unfriendly to Mrs. Lee, who always counted on our little exchanges to brighten her day. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between the pull of family crisis and the gentle demands of neighborly kindness."}
