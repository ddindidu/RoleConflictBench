It was our ritual, and I knew how much it meant to them, especially since I moved out.\n\nBut tonight, my girlfriend sat across from me, arms folded, eyes fixed on the table. We\u2019d just argued about our weekend plans\u2014she thought I\u2019d promised to spend Saturday with her, but I\u2019d forgotten and made other commitments. The air between us was thick with tension. I could see she wanted to talk, to clear things up before the night ended.\n\nMy phone vibrated again. 7:59. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my parents waiting for my call, expecting warmth and attention, and my girlfriend needing me to be present, to listen and resolve things. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the comfort of family and the urgency of love, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
