He looked tired, his brow furrowed as he scrolled through his phone. I remembered our promise to always talk things through, to share our worries instead of bottling them up. I wanted to ask him what was wrong, to be the supportive wife he needed. Just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed.

She rarely asked for help, and I knew she was overwhelmed. I felt torn\u2014my husband needed me to listen, to be present, but Mia was counting on me too. My heart raced as I weighed their needs, feeling the pressure of being a good wife and a dependable friend at the same time."}
