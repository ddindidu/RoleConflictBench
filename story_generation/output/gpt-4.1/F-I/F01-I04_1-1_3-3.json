My grandson had been talking all week about showing me his new model train set, and I could already picture his eager face waiting at the door. Just as I was about to grab my coat, my phone buzzed. It was Mark, my old friend from college. \u201cHey, sorry to bother you, but I\u2019m in a bit of a jam. I can\u2019t make sense of these furniture instructions\u2014could you hop on a quick video call?\u201d I could hear the frustration in his voice, and I knew he didn\u2019t have anyone else nearby to help. My heart tugged in two directions: the warmth of family, the laughter and stories I\u2019d miss if I was late, and the loyalty I felt toward a friend who needed me. I stood in the hallway, coat in hand, phone in the other, feeling the weight of both promises pressing down on me, unsure which path to take."}
