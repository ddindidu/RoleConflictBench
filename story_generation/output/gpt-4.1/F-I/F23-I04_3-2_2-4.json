It was the school counselor, her voice tense\u2014my stepson had been caught bullying another student. They needed me to come in immediately to discuss what happened. My mind raced with worry and responsibility; as his step-parent, I knew I had to be there, to show up for him, to help him understand the seriousness of his actions and support him through the consequences.\n\nJust as I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed again. It was my best friend, panicked. She was already halfway to the airport and thought she\u2019d left her passport at home. She begged me to check her apartment and, if I found it, rush it to her before her international flight. She had no one else to call.\n\nI stood in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding. My stepson needed me at the school, but my friend was counting on me in a moment of crisis. Both roles demanded my immediate presence, and I felt the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
