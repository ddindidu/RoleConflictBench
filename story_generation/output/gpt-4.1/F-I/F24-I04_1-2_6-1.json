Mom always said to keep an eye on him, especially since he\u2019s younger and still gets distracted by every stray cat or shiny rock. I was watching him, making sure he didn\u2019t wander into the road, when my phone buzzed. It was my best friend, Sam. I could hear the tears in her voice before she even finished saying hello. \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now,\u201d she whispered, her words shaky. I glanced at my step-brother, who was already veering toward someone\u2019s front yard, and then back at my phone. Sam never called like this unless it was serious. I knew she expected me to listen, to be there for her, but I also knew Mom would be furious if anything happened to my step-brother on my watch. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once\u2014one as a protector, the other as a confidant\u2014feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
