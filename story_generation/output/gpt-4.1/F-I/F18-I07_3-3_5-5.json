Mom\u2019s counting on you.\u201d My heart squeezed a little. Family gatherings were sacred in our house, and I knew how much it meant to everyone, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last year. But as I glanced at my laptop, the reality of my other world crashed in. My inbox was full of reminders from my project manager\u2014my part of the client deliverable was due tomorrow, and it was the linchpin for the whole team. If I missed the deadline, the client would be furious, and my colleagues would have to scramble to pick up the pieces. I could almost hear the disappointment in my sister\u2019s voice if I bailed, but I could also picture the frustration on my manager\u2019s face if I let the team down. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing I had to choose."}
