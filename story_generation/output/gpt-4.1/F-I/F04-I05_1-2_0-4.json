My little sister, Maya, had just called, her voice bubbling with excitement\u2014she\u2019d won the regional debate championship. She wanted me to come over, to celebrate with the family, to be the proud brother she could lean on. But as I hung up, my phone buzzed again: a reminder for the mentoring session I\u2019d scheduled with my team. The project deadline was looming, and they were counting on me to guide them through the final steps, to share the strategies and insights they needed to succeed. I could picture their anxious faces, waiting for me to start the session I\u2019d promised would be thorough and focused. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward Maya, who deserved my cheers and hugs, and toward my mentees, who needed my guidance. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, torn between being the supportive brother and the reliable mentor, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
