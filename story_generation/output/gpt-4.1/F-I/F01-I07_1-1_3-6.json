The family gathering had been on the calendar for weeks, and I\u2019d promised myself\u2014and them\u2014that I\u2019d be fully present. My daughter caught my eye, smiling, and I felt a swell of warmth. But then my phone buzzed on the kitchen counter. A message from a colleague. \u201cNo immediate action required,\u201d it read, but I knew the unspoken rule: timely responses were expected, even for informational notes. I hesitated, thumb hovering over the screen. If I replied now, I\u2019d be upholding my reputation as a reliable teammate. If I waited, I\u2019d honor my commitment to my family, showing my grandkids that they mattered most. The tug-of-war inside me tightened, each role demanding my attention, each expectation valid. I stood there, caught between the pull of work and the embrace of family, uncertain which part of myself to answer first."}
