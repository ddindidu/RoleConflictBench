My spouse\u2019s text from work is clear: \u201cCan you please fold the laundry today? I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d I know how much it means to share the load, to show I care in these small, everyday ways. But my phone buzzes again\u2014this time, it\u2019s my girlfriend. \u201cCan\u2019t wait for our weekend together. I\u2019ll miss you so much.\u201d She\u2019s leaving for months, and this is our last chance to make memories before the distance stretches between us.\n\nI feel pulled in two directions. If I stay home and fold laundry, I\u2019m a good spouse, reliable and supportive. If I go out, I\u2019m the attentive boyfriend, making the most of precious time. Both expect my presence, my care, my love. My chest tightens as I weigh the guilt of letting one down against the ache of disappointing the other. I sit on the edge of the bed, laundry on one side, suitcase on the other, heart caught in the middle, unsure which role to step into next."}
