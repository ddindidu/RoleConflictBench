Mom sat across from me, her eyes red, voice trembling as she confided in me about her worries at work and how lonely she\u2019d been feeling. She reached for my hand, searching my face for comfort, for the kind of support she rarely asked for but clearly needed now. I wanted to be there for her, to listen, to reassure her that things would get better. But my mind kept drifting to my mentor, who had carved out this tiny window in a jam-packed schedule just for me. I knew how much she valued punctuality and how important this meeting was for my growth. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides\u2014my mom\u2019s vulnerability anchoring me to the kitchen, my mentor\u2019s expectations pulling me toward my room and the waiting laptop. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how to be the child my mom needed and the mentee my mentor expected, both at the same time."}
