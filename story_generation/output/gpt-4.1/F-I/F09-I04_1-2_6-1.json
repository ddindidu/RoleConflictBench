My son bounced into the room, eyes shining with excitement. \u201cMom, is today the day? You promised we\u2019d get the Nintendo!\u201d His hopeful face tugged at my heart, but the reality of our tight budget pressed down on me. I wanted to give him everything, to keep my promise, to see that joy on his face. Just as I was about to answer, my phone buzzed. It was my best friend, her name flashing on the screen. I answered, and immediately heard the tremble in her voice. \u201cCan you talk? I really need you. I just had a huge fight with Alex, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d I could hear her trying not to cry. My son tugged at my sleeve, eyes pleading, while my friend\u2019s pain echoed in my ear. Both needed me, right now, in different ways. My mind raced, torn between being the mother who keeps her promises and the friend who\u2019s always there. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which way to turn."}
