She reminded me about her package deliveries and the power outage scheduled for tomorrow. She asked if I could keep an eye out, maybe even store her frozen food in our fridge if the outage lasted longer than expected. I agreed, knowing how much she\u2019d helped us in the past. But as I put my phone down, I heard my wife\u2019s quiet sob from the bedroom. She\u2019d barely slept in days, her father\u2019s illness weighing on her, and she needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words, my presence. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest. My wife\u2019s pain was raw and immediate, but Mrs. Lee was counting on me too, trusting me with her home and her peace of mind. I paced the hallway, heart pounding, wondering how I could possibly be enough for both of them when they needed me at the same time."}
