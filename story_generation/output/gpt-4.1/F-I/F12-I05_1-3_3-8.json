My husband\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan we try to keep up with the chores this week?\u201d I promised I\u2019d help more, that we\u2019d share the load, but now the hours have slipped away. My phone buzzes\u2014my mentee, anxious about tomorrow\u2019s big presentation, needs a last-minute call. She\u2019s counting on me to help her find her confidence, to guide her through this make-or-break moment. I want to be there for her, to nurture her growth, but the laundry is a tangible reminder of my other promise, my other life. My heart tugs in two directions: the comfort of home, the duty of mentorship. I pace the living room, torn between folding shirts and dialing her number, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, demanding more than I have to give."}
