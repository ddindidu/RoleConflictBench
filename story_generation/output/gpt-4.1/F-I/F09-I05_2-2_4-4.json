In just an hour, I was supposed to lead a crucial mentoring session for my team, sharing the strategies they\u2019d need to meet our looming project deadline. I\u2019d spent days preparing, determined to give them the guidance I wished I\u2019d had early in my career. But right now, I was in the supermarket with my six-year-old, who was darting between aisles, giggling and ignoring my calls to stay close. Other shoppers shot me disapproving looks. I knew I needed to teach him about respect and discipline, to be the mother who set boundaries and modeled good behavior. Yet, my phone buzzed with reminders about the session, and I felt the weight of my mentees\u2019 expectations. They were counting on me to be present, focused, and insightful. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to drop everything and chase after my son, while another part of me screamed to hurry home and review my notes. I stood frozen, torn between the mother my child needed and the mentor my team expected."}
