Miss you!\u201d I glance at it, guilt prickling at the back of my mind. I haven\u2019t called home in days, just sent a quick \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d text yesterday. I know how much it means to my parents to hear from me, especially on weekends. But right now, I\u2019m sitting across from Alex at our favorite caf\u00e9, trying to memorize every detail of his face. He leaves for London tomorrow, and I promised we\u2019d spend every moment together before he goes. He reaches for my hand, smiling softly, and I feel the weight of his expectation\u2014be present, make this time count. My phone vibrates again. I want to call Mom, to reassure her, but I can\u2019t pull myself away from Alex, not now. The pressure builds inside me, torn between being the attentive daughter my parents hope for and the loving girlfriend Alex needs. I stare at my phone, heart pounding, caught between two worlds, unsure which one to answer first."}
