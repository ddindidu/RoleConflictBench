He asked about my day, and I hesitated, unsure how much to share. I wanted to be open, to let him in on the stress I felt at work, but I also didn\u2019t want to burden him. He looked at me expectantly, waiting for me to communicate, to be the wife who shares her thoughts and feelings.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from one of my mentees, asking for advice about a small but urgent career decision. I knew she relied on me for guidance, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility. I wanted to respond right away, to be the mentor who is always there, offering support and wisdom.\n\nI glanced at my husband, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. I wanted to be present for him, to talk honestly about my day, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my mentee down. The expectations pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
