I promised her I\u2019d be there, and I wanted to keep that promise. But as I closed the email, my phone buzzed with a message from my mentor: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to finish the code sample before our next meeting. Looking forward to seeing your approach.\u201d The assignment was tough, and I needed every spare hour to get it right. My mentor expected me to be prepared, to show progress and commitment. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I went to the open class, I\u2019d lose precious time for coding. If I stayed home to work, I\u2019d let my stepdaughter down. My mind spun with guilt and anxiety, torn between being the supportive parent she needed and the dedicated mentee I wanted to be. I sat at my desk, heart pounding, unable to decide which role to disappoint."}
