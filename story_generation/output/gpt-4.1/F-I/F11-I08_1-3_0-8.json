She had just landed her dream job, and I knew how much this meant to her. As her sister, I was expected to celebrate her achievements, to be her biggest supporter. We hugged, and she started telling me all about her new position. Then, halfway through our conversation, my phone buzzed. It was a message from an acquaintance, Sarah, who worked in the same company Mia was about to join. Sarah had just learned something sensitive about Mia\u2019s new boss\u2014something that, if spread, could seriously damage his reputation. As an acquaintance, I was expected to avoid gossip and not speak negatively about others, especially when the information could be harmful. But Mia was eager to know everything about her new workplace, and she asked if I\u2019d heard anything about her boss. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I wrestled with the urge to protect my sister and celebrate her milestone, while also honoring the trust and discretion expected of me as an acquaintance."}
