It was Sunday evening, the hour I always called my parents. They looked forward to these calls, and I knew how much it meant to them to hear about my week and share their own stories. I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss it, not after last time when Mom sounded disappointed. But tonight, I was at a small gathering, and I\u2019d just started talking to a new acquaintance, Jamie. Jamie seemed anxious, barely making eye contact, and I could tell they needed someone to help them feel comfortable. I wanted to be that person\u2014friendly, open, someone who could draw them out of their shell. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder from Dad. I felt a knot in my stomach. If I stepped away to call my parents, I\u2019d leave Jamie alone, maybe make them feel even more out of place. But if I stayed, I\u2019d break my promise to my parents. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
