I\u2019m freaking out.\u201d He had his final exam tomorrow, and I knew how much he depended on me to calm his nerves. I promised him I\u2019d be there, that we\u2019d get through it together, just like always. But as I was about to leave, my boyfriend called, his voice tight and hurt. \u201cWe need to talk. Now. I can\u2019t keep doing this if we don\u2019t figure things out.\u201d Our last argument still echoed in my mind, and I knew this conversation could decide everything between us. My brother needed me to be his anchor, to reassure him that he wasn\u2019t alone. My boyfriend needed me to show I cared enough to fight for us, to resolve the tension that was tearing us apart. I felt pulled in two directions, my heart pounding with guilt and anxiety, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
