She\u2019d just started her first job, and the family group chat was alive with her updates\u2014her excitement, her nerves, her little victories. I knew how much it meant to her, and to the rest of the family, that I responded quickly, shared in her joy, and offered encouragement. But just as I started typing a reply, my mentee, Alex, slid into the seat across from me. \u201cHey, do you have a minute? I\u2019m stuck on that project you mentioned last week.\u201d His eyes were hopeful, and I could see he was eager to learn, to soak up any advice I could give. I felt the familiar tug\u2014my family expecting my presence and support, my mentee needing my guidance. My thumb hovered over the send button, my mind split between the warmth of family connection and the responsibility of nurturing someone\u2019s professional growth. The seconds ticked by, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my attention, each unwilling to wait."}
