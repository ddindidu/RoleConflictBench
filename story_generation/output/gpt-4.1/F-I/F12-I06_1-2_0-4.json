He told me about a frustrating meeting, his voice light but his eyes tired. I knew he wanted me to listen, to be present, to offer the comfort he always found in our evening talks. I sat beside him, but my mind kept drifting. My phone buzzed with a reminder: my mentor was expecting an update tonight. The technical issue I\u2019d hit today had left me stuck, and I knew I should reach out, explain the problem before it grew worse. But my husband\u2019s hand found mine, and I saw the hope in his face\u2014he needed me, right now, to be his support. My chest tightened as I tried to split my attention, guilt rising no matter which way I leaned. I wanted to be the wife he could count on, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my mentor down or risk falling behind. The weight of both expectations pressed in, and I sat there, torn, unsure which need to answer first."}
