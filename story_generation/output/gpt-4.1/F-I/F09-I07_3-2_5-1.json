My phone buzzed with reminders, but before I could check it, I saw my son\u2019s small hand slip a candy bar into his pocket. My heart dropped. I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to make him understand that stealing is unacceptable. But as I knelt down to talk to him, my phone vibrated again\u2014my colleague\u2019s message: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, this meeting is crucial. We need your input.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me. My son\u2019s wide, guilty eyes pleaded for comfort and guidance, while my team expected me to be present, focused, and professional. I could feel the clock ticking, my mind racing between the lesson my child needed and the responsibility my colleagues counted on. I stood there, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
