As his step-parent, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing\u2014even just a pack of cookies\u2014was unacceptable. I could already hear my partner\u2019s voice in my head, urging me to be firm but fair, to set a good example. But as soon as we got home, my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Lee next door. She was already on her way to the airport, reminding me to keep an eye out for her package and to make sure her fridge stayed cold during the power cut. I promised her I\u2019d help, but now I was torn. My stepson needed my full attention, a serious talk, maybe even a trip back to the store to make things right. But Mrs. Lee was counting on me, too, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, my stepson\u2019s small, trembling hand in the other, feeling the weight of both responsibilities pressing in on me."}
