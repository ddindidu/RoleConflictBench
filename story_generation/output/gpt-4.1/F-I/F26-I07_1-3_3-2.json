The family gathering had been planned for weeks\u2014my daughter had even called to remind me how much the grandkids were looking forward to baking cookies together. I could already picture their flour-dusted faces and the laughter echoing through the kitchen. But then, an email notification blinked on my screen: the final team meeting was set for the exact same afternoon. My manager\u2019s message was clear\u2014everyone\u2019s input was crucial before we locked in the new project direction. I knew my colleagues expected me to be present, to contribute my experience and insights. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My family wanted my warmth and attention, my team needed my expertise and commitment. I could almost hear my granddaughter\u2019s disappointed sigh if I missed the gathering, and I could imagine the awkward silence in the meeting if my chair sat empty. My mind raced, torn between the joy of family and the responsibility of work, unable to see how I could possibly be in two places at once."}
