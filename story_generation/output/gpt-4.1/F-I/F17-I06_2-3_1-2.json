I know how much they look forward to these calls, especially since I moved out. But my laptop screen glares at me, the unfinished project from my mentor staring back. She assigned it last minute, emphasizing its importance\u2014upper management will review it tomorrow. I can almost hear her voice, \u201cThis is your chance to shine. Don\u2019t let me down.\u201d My parents expect warmth and presence; my mentor expects focus and results. My heart pounds as I glance between my phone and the blinking cursor.
