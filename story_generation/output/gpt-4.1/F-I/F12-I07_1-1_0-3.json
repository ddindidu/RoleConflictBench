He looked up and smiled, but I could see the tiredness in his eyes. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, setting my things down. He shrugged, trying to play it off, but I knew him well enough to sense he needed to talk. I wanted to sit beside him, listen, and offer comfort\u2014he always did the same for me.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the report for tomorrow\u2019s meeting. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I\u2019d promised my team I\u2019d finish it tonight. They were counting on me to keep things moving smoothly, even if the deadline was generous. I could hear my husband sigh softly, and I felt the pull between my roles\u2014wife and colleague. Both expected something from me, and I wanted to be there for both. My heart ached as I stood in the hallway, torn between opening my laptop and sitting down beside him, unsure which role to choose in that moment."}
