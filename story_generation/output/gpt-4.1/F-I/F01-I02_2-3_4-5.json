My daughter had just called, her voice bubbling with excitement\u2014my grandson had won his first art competition, and the family was gathering tonight to celebrate. She wanted me there, to see his proud smile, to be the grandfather who never misses a milestone. But as I hung up, another message flashed on my screen. It was from Anna, my girlfriend. She reminded me, gently, that this was our last weekend together before her big move overseas. She\u2019d planned a quiet evening for just the two of us, a chance to savor every moment before the distance set in.\n\nI could feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me. My family expected me to be the steady presence, the one who shows up. Anna needed me to be her anchor, to make our last night together count. My heart tugged in two directions, guilt and longing swirling inside me. I stared at the clock, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once, and wondered how I could possibly choose."}
