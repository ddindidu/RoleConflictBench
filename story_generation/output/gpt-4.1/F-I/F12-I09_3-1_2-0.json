He\u2019s been struggling for weeks, and I know he needs me\u2014my words, my arms, my quiet presence. I want to drop everything and sit beside him, to let him know I\u2019m here, that he\u2019s not alone. But just as I\u2019m about to go to him, I hear footsteps in the corridor. Through the peephole, I see Mrs. Lee, our neighbor, heading out with her dog. She always expects a cheerful hello, a quick chat about the weather or her garden. I know she\u2019ll notice if I don\u2019t greet her, and she\u2019s told me before how much she values our friendly exchanges. My heart pounds as I stand frozen by the door, torn between the desperate need in my husband\u2019s eyes and the polite expectation waiting just outside. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the weight of both roles presses down on me, making it hard to breathe."}
