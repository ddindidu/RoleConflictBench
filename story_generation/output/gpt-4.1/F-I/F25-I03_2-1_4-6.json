We all need to be together for the family dinner\u2014no excuses.\u201d She looked at me with that hopeful, almost pleading expression, and I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation. My dad chimed in, reminding me how much it would mean to him if I helped keep our family traditions alive, especially now that things were finally settling down.\n\nBut my phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen. It was Mia, my girlfriend. Her message was short but tense: \u201cCan we talk? I thought we agreed to spend Saturday together. I don\u2019t get why you keep changing plans.\u201d I could sense her frustration, and I knew she expected me to call, to smooth things over, to show her that our relationship mattered.\n\nI stared at the phone, torn.

My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be both the step-child they wanted and the girlfriend Mia needed."}
