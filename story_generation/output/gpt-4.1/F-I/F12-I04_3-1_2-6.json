His eyes were red, his voice barely above a whisper as he tried to make sense of the news he\u2019d just received. I could feel the weight of his need for me\u2014he needed me to be present, to listen, to reassure him that things would be okay, even if I wasn\u2019t sure myself. My phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. I glanced at the screen and saw a string of confused messages from my friend, who was waiting for me at the caf\u00e9. She thought we were meeting at the park. I knew if I didn\u2019t reply now, she\u2019d feel abandoned, maybe even hurt, and the misunderstanding would only grow. My husband squeezed my hand tighter, searching my face for comfort. My friend\u2019s messages kept coming, each one more anxious than the last. I felt torn in two, my heart pulled by the urgent needs of the two people I cared about most, unsure how to be the support they both expected from me in this moment."}
