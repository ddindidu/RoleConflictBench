It\u2019ll mean a lot to your dad if you\u2019re there.\u201d I knew how much these family trips mattered, especially since I was still the \u201cnew\u201d sibling, always trying to fit in, to show I cared. But as I scrolled, another notification popped up\u2014my mentee, Jamie, asking if we could meet Friday afternoon. She\u2019d been missing deadlines, her confidence slipping. As her mentor, I was supposed to be available, to help her set goals and find her footing. I could hear my dad\u2019s voice, hopeful for a rare weekend together, and Jamie\u2019s, anxious and uncertain. My chest tightened. If I left Jamie hanging, I\u2019d fail her when she needed me most. If I skipped the trip, I\u2019d disappoint my family and risk widening the gap I\u2019d worked so hard to close. I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, each expecting me to show up, each needing me in a different way."}
