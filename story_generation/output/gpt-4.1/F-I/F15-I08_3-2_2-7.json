The principal had called earlier, explaining that my son was caught bullying a classmate. My heart ached with worry and disappointment, knowing I needed to be present for him, to show up at the school and address the situation as a responsible parent. I rehearsed what I might say, torn between defending him and holding him accountable.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed again. It was a group chat with some acquaintances from work. One of them, Mark, made a snide remark about another colleague\u2019s recent project, hinting at incompetence. I felt the familiar pressure to join in, to not seem aloof or judgmental, but I also knew I shouldn\u2019t encourage gossip or negativity. My mind spun with the weight of both roles\u2014my child needed me to be a guiding parent, while my acquaintances expected me to blend in and not disrupt the flow of conversation. I stared at my phone, feeling the tension build, unsure which expectation I could meet without betraying the other."}
