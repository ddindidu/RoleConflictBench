My younger brother, Sam, texted, \u201cCan you come over? I really need to talk.\u201d He never asked for help unless he was truly upset. At the same time, my boyfriend, Alex, messaged, \u201cCan we talk? I\u2019m confused about our plans this weekend.\u201d I could sense the tension in his words; we\u2019d just had a small disagreement about whether to spend Saturday with his friends or mine.\n\nI stared at the screen, feeling my chest tighten. Sam had always counted on me to be there when things got rough at home, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never let him down. But Alex expected me to work through issues together, not leave things hanging. I knew if I didn\u2019t respond soon, he\u2019d feel ignored, maybe even hurt. Both needed me, both right now, and I felt pulled in two directions\u2014torn between being the reliable sister and the understanding girlfriend. My mind raced, guilt and worry swirling as I tried to figure out who needed me more, and what I was supposed to do next."}
