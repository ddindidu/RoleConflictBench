She needed me\u2014her breakup had left her shattered, and she\u2019d always been there for me. I promised I\u2019d come over, that I\u2019d help her through this, just like we always did. But as I reached for my keys, my phone buzzed again. It was my boyfriend, his message sharp and urgent: \u201cWe need to talk. Now. If we can\u2019t fix this, I don\u2019t know if we should keep trying.\u201d My heart pounded. He was waiting for me to show I cared enough to fight for us, to resolve the argument that had left us both raw and uncertain. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my sister\u2019s pain, my boyfriend\u2019s ultimatum. Both needed me, both expected me to be there, and I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of letting either down. My hands shook as I stared at the screen, torn between the two people I loved most, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
