I knew they needed me\u2014my mother\u2019s sighs lingered in the air, and my father\u2019s silence was heavier than usual. I wanted to sit with them, listen, and offer the comfort I knew they expected from me as their son. But my phone buzzed again: a message from Maya, my mentee. Her big presentation was tomorrow, and she was panicking, desperate for guidance. She counted on me to help her grow, to push her to believe in herself, especially now when her future seemed to hinge on this one moment. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the living room, where my parents waited for a reassuring word, and toward my phone, where Maya\u2019s anxious words blinked on the screen. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to be the anchor they needed. I closed my eyes, torn, unsure which need to answer first."}
