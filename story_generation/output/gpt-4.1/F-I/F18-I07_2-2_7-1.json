My team was gathering in ten minutes, and I knew this session was crucial\u2014project updates, new assignments, things I couldn\u2019t afford to miss. But just as I was about to head out, my younger brother called from the backyard. He was strapping on his helmet, grinning, and pointing at the steep, cracked ramp he\u2019d been eyeing for weeks. \u201cWatch this, I\u2019m finally going to nail it!\u201d he shouted. My heart pounded. As his sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t get hurt. But as a colleague, I was expected to be present, engaged, and reliable. I could already imagine my manager\u2019s disappointment if I skipped the meeting, and my brother\u2019s crushed look if I left him alone. Torn between the urgent pull of family and the pressing demands of work, I stood frozen, phone in one hand, helmet in the other, wrestling with which part of me should take the lead."}
