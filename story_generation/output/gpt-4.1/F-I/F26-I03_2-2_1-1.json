Rough day.\u201d I glanced across the room at my granddaughter, slumped over her homework, her eyes red-rimmed. She\u2019d barely spoken since coming home, and I could sense the weight she carried, the silent plea for comfort. As a grandmother, I felt the urge to sit beside her, offer gentle words, and share stories of my own struggles, hoping to guide her through this storm. But my partner\u2019s text tugged at me too\u2014he needed me, needed my reassurance and warmth after the blow at work. I could picture him, shoulders hunched, waiting for my call. My heart ached, torn between the wisdom I owed my granddaughter and the emotional support my partner expected. Both needed me, right now, in different ways. I stared at my phone, then at my granddaughter, feeling the pressure mount, unsure which role to step into first."}
