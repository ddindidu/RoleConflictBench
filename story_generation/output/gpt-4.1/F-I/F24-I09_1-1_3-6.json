My mom looks at me, expecting me to chime in, to show I\u2019m part of this family, not just a guest. I nod, trying to seem enthusiastic, but my phone buzzes with a message from Mrs. Lee next door. She\u2019s asking if I can keep an eye out for her package this afternoon; she\u2019s at work and it\u2019s something important. I glance at the clock. The family meeting will probably stretch into the afternoon, and I know my stepdad wants us all together, no distractions. But Mrs. Lee has always been kind, watering our plants when we\u2019re away, and I don\u2019t want to let her down. My heart pounds as I try to figure out how to be a good step-sibling and a good neighbor at the same time, feeling the pressure of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
