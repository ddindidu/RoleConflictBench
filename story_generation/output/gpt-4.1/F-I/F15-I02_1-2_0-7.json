I could already picture their faces scanning the crowd, hoping to spot me. But my phone buzzed again, a message from Emily: \u201cCan we talk? I can\u2019t keep going like this.\u201d We\u2019d been arguing all week about money, bills piling up, and I knew she needed me to listen, to help fix things between us. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my children expecting their dad to show up, Emily expecting her boyfriend to step up. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, torn between the school\u2019s familiar routine and the urgent need to mend things with Emily.
