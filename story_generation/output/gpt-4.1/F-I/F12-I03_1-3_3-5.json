As a wife, I know I should help fold it, share the load, keep our home running smoothly. My husband\u2019s been working late all week, and I promised I\u2019d take care of it. But my phone buzzes\u2014a message from Alex, my boyfriend. He\u2019s leaving for Europe tomorrow, gone for months, and this is our last weekend together. He wants to spend every moment with me, just us, making memories before the distance stretches between us. My heart aches with guilt and longing. I want to be the reliable wife, the one who keeps her promises, but I also want to be the loving girlfriend, present and attentive. The laundry sits untouched, and I feel pulled in two directions, each role demanding more than I can give. I pace the living room, torn, the weight of expectation pressing down, unsure which part of me to disappoint."}
