During family gatherings, we\u2019re encouraged to discuss things openly, never shying away from what\u2019s really happening, even if it means pointing out someone\u2019s mistakes. Today, at a holiday dinner, my mother brought up a story about a distant cousin\u2019s recent troubles at work, and everyone chimed in with their opinions. \n\nLater, while helping clear the table, an acquaintance who had joined us for the first time quietly told me that in their circle, it\u2019s considered wrong to talk about others\u2019 shortcomings, especially when they\u2019re not present. They said it\u2019s better to avoid gossip and focus on positive things. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing on me\u2014my family\u2019s tradition of open, sometimes critical discussion, and my acquaintance\u2019s belief in kindness and restraint. I stood there, plate in hand, torn between defending my family\u2019s way and respecting my acquaintance\u2019s values, unsure of what to say next."}
