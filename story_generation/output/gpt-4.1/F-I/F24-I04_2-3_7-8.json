He was determined to land a new trick, but I knew how risky it was. As his step-sibling, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014Mom always said we had to look out for each other, and I couldn\u2019t shake the image of him falling, getting hurt. But just as I opened my mouth to warn him, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my best friend, short and cold: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that.\u201d My stomach twisted. I\u2019d made a careless joke earlier, and now I realized it had cut deeper than I intended. As a friend, I owed it to them to call right away, to explain and apologize before things got worse. But if I turned away now, my stepbrother might try the trick without anyone watching out for him. My heart pounded, torn between the urgent need to protect my brother and the desperate need to fix things with my friend. I stood frozen, phone in hand, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
