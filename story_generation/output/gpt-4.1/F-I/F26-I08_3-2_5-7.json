She needed me\u2014something serious had happened, and as a grandmother, I knew my presence would bring comfort and stability to the family. My heart ached to be there, to hold my grandchildren and reassure my daughter that everything would be alright. Just then, my neighbor, Linda, who had stopped by for coffee, leaned in and whispered, \u201cDid you hear about Mark\u2019s latest project at work? It was a disaster. I don\u2019t know how he keeps his job.\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip, believing it only bred negativity.
