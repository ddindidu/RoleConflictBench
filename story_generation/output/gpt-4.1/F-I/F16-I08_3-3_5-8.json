My cousins will be here in an hour, and the place needs to look perfect.\u201d I nodded, feeling the pressure mount. Every surface had to shine, every cushion fluffed\u2014my partner was counting on me to help make a good impression. Just as I reached for the vacuum, my phone buzzed. It was Priya, an acquaintance from work. Her voice was urgent, \u201cDid you hear about Rohan? I just found out something big\u2014he\u2019s been lying about his credentials.\u201d She wanted to talk, to share, maybe even to vent. I knew the expectation: don\u2019t gossip, don\u2019t spread rumors, don\u2019t be the person who harms someone\u2019s reputation.

My heart pounded as I tried to figure out which role I should honor first."}
