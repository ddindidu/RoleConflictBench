My husband paced the living room, his face drawn with worry. He\u2019d just been offered a promotion, but it meant relocating\u2014something he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted. He looked at me, searching for reassurance, for the kind of unwavering support I\u2019d always promised. I wanted to be there for him, to listen, to help him sort through his doubts. But my mind kept drifting to the spreadsheet on my screen. My team at work was waiting for my part of the project. The deadline wasn\u2019t tight, but I\u2019d promised to finish it tonight, and I hated letting people down. I could hear the ping of new emails, reminders of my responsibilities as a colleague. My husband\u2019s voice broke through my thoughts, soft and uncertain, \u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting something different from me, and I didn\u2019t know how to be everything to everyone at once."}
