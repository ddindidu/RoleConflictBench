He\u2019d helped me once before, so I felt obligated to return the favor. At the same time, I glanced at the note on the fridge: \u201cDon\u2019t forget the Nintendo for Jamie\u2019s birthday!\u201d My partner and I had promised Jamie, my stepchild, that we\u2019d get it this year, and I knew how much it meant to them. But money was tight, and I\u2019d planned to pick up extra shifts to cover the cost. If I helped my acquaintance, I\u2019d have to skip those shifts, making the Nintendo purchase nearly impossible. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me\u2014Jamie\u2019s hopeful eyes, my partner\u2019s trust, and my acquaintance\u2019s reliance. My stomach twisted as I tried to figure out how to be the dependable step-parent and the supportive friend at the same time, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy both."}
