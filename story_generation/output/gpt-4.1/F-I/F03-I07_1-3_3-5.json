The deadline was tomorrow, and my part was crucial\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish tonight, the whole project would stall, and the client would be furious. My phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, dinner starts at six. Grandpa is counting on you to help with the prayers.\u201d It was the annual family gathering, a tradition I\u2019d never missed. I could already picture my father\u2019s disappointed look if I arrived late, the silent judgment from my relatives if I prioritized work over family. But my team was counting on me too; I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d deliver. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations\u2014uphold the family\u2019s values, or meet my professional commitment. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me from both sides, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
