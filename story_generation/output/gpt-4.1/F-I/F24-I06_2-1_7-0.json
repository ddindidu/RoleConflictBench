He grinned, skateboard in hand, ready to try a trick he\u2019d only seen online. My heart thudded. As his step-sibling, I knew Mom expected me to look out for him, especially since he\u2019d broken his wrist last year. But Jamie hated being told what to do, and I didn\u2019t want to be the nagging sibling who ruined his fun.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder about the optional reading my mentor suggested. She\u2019d said it wasn\u2019t urgent, but I wanted to impress her and prove I was serious about learning. I could sneak inside for a quiet hour to get ahead, but if I left Jamie alone, what if he got hurt? The pressure from both sides squeezed my chest\u2014my mentor\u2019s trust in my independence, my family\u2019s trust in my care. I stood frozen on the porch, torn between the ramp and the reading, feeling the weight of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
