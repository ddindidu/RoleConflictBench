She was curled up on the couch, tears streaming down her face, and I knew she needed me to be there, to listen and reassure her that things would be okay. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the HOA inspection was in an hour, and I\u2019d left a stack of boxes in the corridor outside my apartment\u2014boxes my sister had brought over when she moved in temporarily. If I didn\u2019t move them, we could get cited, and my neighbors would be upset about the blocked exit. But if I left my sister now, even for a few minutes, I\u2019d be abandoning her when she needed me most. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between being the supportive sibling she expected and the responsible neighbor everyone relied on. My heart pounded as I glanced between my sister\u2019s tearful face and the door, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
