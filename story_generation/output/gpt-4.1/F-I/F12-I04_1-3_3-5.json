He\u2019d been picking up the slack all week, and I knew he was counting on me to do my part. Just as I reached for the first shirt, my phone buzzed. It was a frantic call from my best friend\u2014her car had broken down on the highway, and she sounded scared, stranded in the dark. She needed me, now. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock, then at the laundry, then back at my phone. I could hear my husband in the kitchen, probably expecting me to finish up soon so we could relax together. But my friend\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, desperate and alone. I felt torn in two, guilt and worry twisting inside me. Both needed me, both counted on me, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
