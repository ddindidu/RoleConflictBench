He grinned at me, excitement in his eyes, but all I could see was the jagged concrete and the memory of his last fall. As his step-sibling, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014Mom always said we had to look out for each other, and I knew she trusted me to keep him safe. I wanted to tell him to wait, to practice somewhere safer, but I also didn\u2019t want to be the nagging sister who ruined his fun.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my boyfriend, asking which night I wanted to go out this week. He\u2019d been hinting that we needed more time together, just us, and I missed him too. But if I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning my stepbrother right when he might need me most. My heart twisted as I tried to balance the pull of both roles\u2014caring for my family and nurturing my relationship\u2014knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
