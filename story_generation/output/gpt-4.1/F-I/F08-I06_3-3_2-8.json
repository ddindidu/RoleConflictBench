She\u2019d squeezed me in before her flight, and I knew how precious her time was. I\u2019d prepared questions, determined to make the most of every minute. Just as I opened my laptop, my granddaughter appeared in the doorway, her eyes red and anxious. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? It\u2019s really important,\u201d she whispered, voice trembling. My heart clenched. She rarely asked for help, and I could see she needed me now, not later. I wanted to wrap her in my arms, listen, and offer the wisdom she trusted me to give. But the clock ticked down, and I pictured my mentor waiting, expecting me to be focused and respectful of her tight schedule. Torn between the urgent needs of my granddaughter and my commitment to my mentor, I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore."}
