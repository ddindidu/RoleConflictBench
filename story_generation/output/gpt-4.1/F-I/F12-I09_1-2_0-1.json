As I set it on the counter, my husband walked in, dropping his bag with a sigh. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d he said, rubbing his temples. I could tell he wanted to talk, maybe just unwind with me for a while. I reached for his hand, but just then, I saw our neighbor through the window, heading toward our door. I remembered how important it was to make a good first impression, to be warm and welcoming. The cake was ready, and I\u2019d been waiting for this chance. But my husband\u2019s tired eyes pulled at me, reminding me that he needed comfort, too. I stood there, torn, the cake in my hands and my husband\u2019s needs in my heart, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me at once."}
