My daughter\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, pleading for me to come over\u2014something serious had happened, and the family needed me. As a grandmother, I knew how much my presence meant, especially in moments like these. But just as I was about to grab my keys, a message from my friend flashed on the screen. She\u2019d read my earlier comment, the one I\u2019d meant as a joke, and now she was hurt, her words sharp with pain. I felt a knot tighten in my chest. As her friend, I owed her an immediate apology, a real conversation to clear the misunderstanding before it festered. Both roles pulled at me\u2014my family expecting my comfort and wisdom, my friend needing my honesty and care. I stared at the phone, torn, my heart heavy with the weight of two worlds colliding."}
