He\u2019d squeezed me into his schedule for a quick check-in, and I knew how rare that was. I grabbed my bag, rehearsing the questions I wanted to ask, when my brother\u2019s name flashed on the screen. He never called during the day unless it was serious. I answered, and his voice was shaky\u2014he\u2019d just gotten some bad news and needed to talk. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, no matter what. But Dr. Patel\u2019s time was precious, and I\u2019d already rescheduled twice. My brother\u2019s words tumbled out, raw and urgent, while the clock ticked closer to my meeting. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me from both sides. I wanted to be the brother he could count on, but I also didn\u2019t want to let down the mentor who believed in me.
