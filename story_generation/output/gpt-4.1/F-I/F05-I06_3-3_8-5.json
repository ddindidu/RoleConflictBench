She wanted me to be open, to share every worry and every number, so we could face it together. I knew she expected nothing less than full transparency, and I wanted to give her that. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my mentor, asking for an update on the project. The truth was, my team was falling apart, and the deadline was slipping through my fingers. I was supposed to communicate any challenge immediately, to be upfront about setbacks, but I hadn\u2019t told him yet. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me: my wife\u2019s need for honesty, my mentor\u2019s demand for promptness.
