She\u2019d been holed up for hours, textbooks scattered everywhere, her anxiety about tomorrow\u2019s final exam almost palpable through the walls. I knew she needed me\u2014she always counted on me to help her talk through her worries, to remind her she was capable. But Mark\u2019s email sat unread in my inbox, and even though he said there was no rush, I could almost hear the unspoken expectation: be responsive, be reliable, don\u2019t let the team down. I stood in the hallway, torn. If I went to my sister now, I\u2019d be ignoring my colleague\u2019s trust in my professionalism. If I answered Mark first, I\u2019d be letting my sister down when she needed me most. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My hand hovered over my phone, heart pounding, as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to disappoint."}
