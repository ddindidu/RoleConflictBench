I wanted to guide her, to share stories from my own tangled friendships, to help her avoid the mistakes I\u2019d made. Just as I opened my mouth, I heard laughter from the group of acquaintances nearby. They were discussing a mutual colleague\u2019s recent choices, their words sharp and judgmental. One of them turned to me, inviting me into the conversation with a knowing look, expecting me to join in. I felt the weight of my granddaughter\u2019s expectation for honesty and guidance, and the unspoken rule among acquaintances not to speak ill or fuel gossip. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to share a cautionary tale that might help my granddaughter, but would mean speaking about someone not present. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding something different, and I sat frozen, caught between the wisdom I wanted to offer and the respect I knew I should uphold."}
