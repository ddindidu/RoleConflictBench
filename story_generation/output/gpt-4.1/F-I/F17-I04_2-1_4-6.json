My family had just finished reminding me how important it was to respect our traditions, especially during meals\u2014no phones, no distractions, just us and our customs. I nodded along, feeling the weight of their expectations settle on my shoulders. But my mind kept drifting to my friend, who was waiting for me after dinner. She\u2019d already messaged twice, sounding confused about where we were supposed to meet. I knew she valued honesty and quick communication, especially when things got mixed up. I could almost hear her voice in my head, urging me to just send a quick text to clear things up. My fingers itched to reach for my phone, but I could feel my parents\u2019 eyes on me, expecting me to honor our family\u2019s rules. The pressure built inside me, torn between being the respectful child they wanted and the reliable friend I promised to be."}
