I knew they needed me to be present, to listen, to offer comfort. Tonight, I planned to sit with them, maybe make tea, and just be there. But as I was about to head to the kitchen, my phone buzzed with a message from the building group chat: a noise complaint had been made about our apartment. My heart sank. I remembered the laughter from last night\u2019s movie, the clatter of dishes. \n\nJust then, I saw Mrs. Lee, our neighbor, waiting in the lobby. She smiled, but her eyes were searching. I knew I had to be extra polite, to smooth things over, to show I was a considerate neighbor. But my mind was split\u2014my parents needed me upstairs, and Mrs. Lee expected a friendly, apologetic neighbor right now. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the comfort my parents deserved and the courtesy my neighbor required. My feet felt rooted to the spot, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which door to walk through first."}
