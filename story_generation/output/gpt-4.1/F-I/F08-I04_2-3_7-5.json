Family means everything to me, and I know how much it matters to her that I\u2019m involved and supportive. As I reached for the phone, it buzzed with a frantic call from my oldest friend, Linda. Her voice trembled as she told me her car had broken down on the highway, miles from home, and she was scared and alone in the dark. She needed me right away. My heart twisted. I could picture my granddaughter waiting for my call, eager to share her news, and I could hear the fear in Linda\u2019s voice, counting on me to be there for her. Both needed me, right now, in different ways. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, torn between the warmth of family and the loyalty of friendship, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
