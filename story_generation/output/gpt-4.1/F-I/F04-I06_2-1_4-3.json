Mom\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, everyone\u2019s looking forward to catching up.\u201d As the eldest brother, I knew how much these gatherings meant, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last year. I could already picture my younger siblings waiting for me, expecting me to bring my usual energy and jokes.\n\nBut as I was about to leave, I remembered the email from my mentor. She always emphasized open communication, urging me to reach out with any questions, no matter how small. I had stumbled over a term in the latest project brief\u2014nothing urgent, but I knew she valued promptness and initiative. If I messaged her now, I\u2019d be late for dinner. If I waited, I\u2019d be ignoring her advice and possibly seem disengaged.\n\nI stood in the hallway, phone in hand, torn between the warmth of my family waiting at the table and the responsibility I felt toward my mentor\u2019s expectations. My heart pounded as I weighed which role needed me more in this moment."}
