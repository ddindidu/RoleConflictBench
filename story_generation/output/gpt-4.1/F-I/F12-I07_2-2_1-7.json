My husband paced the living room, his brow furrowed, pausing every few minutes to glance at me with anxious eyes. He\u2019d just told me about the difficult choice he had to make at work\u2014one that could change the course of his career. He needed me to listen, to reassure him, to help him sort through his tangled thoughts. I wanted to be present, to offer the comfort and advice he was seeking.\n\nBut my phone kept lighting up with notifications from my team. They were waiting for my response to a question that would determine the next steps of our project. I knew they couldn\u2019t move forward until I clarified a key detail, and the clock was ticking. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing on me, the urgency in their messages growing with each passing minute.\n\nMy heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my husband, who needed my undivided attention, and toward my colleagues, who depended on my timely input. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the pressure mount as I wrestled with which role to answer first."}
