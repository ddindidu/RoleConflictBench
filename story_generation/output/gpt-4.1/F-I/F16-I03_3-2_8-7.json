My spouse was across from me, eyes searching mine, waiting for me to open up about the medical bill that had just arrived. \u201cWe need to talk about this,\u201d he said gently, expecting honesty and partnership. But my mind was tangled. Just an hour ago, my boyfriend and I had another heated argument about money\u2014he wanted me to be more understanding, to help us move past our fights and find solutions. He hated when I shut down or avoided the issue, and I could still feel the sting of his words from earlier.\n\nNow, my spouse needed me to be transparent, to share everything so we could make decisions together. But I was exhausted, torn between the need to be open here and the pressure to smooth things over there. Both wanted something from me\u2014honesty, resolution\u2014but I felt like I was failing at both. My heart pounded as I tried to find the right words, knowing that whatever I said next would matter deeply to someone I cared about."}
