She was upset after our argument last night, and I knew she expected me to reach out first, to listen and show patience with her point of view. We\u2019d always promised to respect each other, even when we disagreed. But as I sat at my desk, my inbox pinged with another reminder from my manager: the report I was working on was overdue, and the client was waiting. My part was holding up the whole project, and my team was counting on me to deliver. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my sister needed me to be understanding and present, but my colleagues needed me to be focused and efficient. My mind raced, torn between the urge to call my sister and the guilt of letting my team down. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt paralyzed, unable to choose which role to fulfill first."}
