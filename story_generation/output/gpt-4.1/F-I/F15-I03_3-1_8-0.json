The numbers glared at me, reminding me that the home loan repayment was looming in just two months. I needed to find a way to tighten our spending, maybe even take on extra shifts at work. My mind raced with calculations and worries about keeping our home secure for my child.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my boyfriend: \u201cRough day. Can I come over?\u201d I could hear the fatigue in his words, and I knew he needed me to listen, to comfort him, to be present. But my head was still full of bills and deadlines. I wanted to be the supportive girlfriend he deserved, but the weight of my responsibilities as a parent pressed down on me. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the stability my family needed and the emotional support my partner longed for. I stared at my phone, paralyzed, unsure which role to answer first."}
