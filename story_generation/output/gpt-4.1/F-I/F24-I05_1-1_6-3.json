Today, though, he\u2019s unusually quiet, glancing at his phone every few steps. I notice a group of older kids hanging out by the corner store, the same ones who sometimes tease younger students. As his step-sibling, I feel the urge to keep Jamie close, to make sure he\u2019s safe and doesn\u2019t get drawn into trouble. But as his mentor\u2014something our parents encouraged, since I\u2019m a couple of years older\u2014I know I\u2019m supposed to let him handle small challenges, to answer his questions and help him grow more independent.\n\nJamie suddenly asks, \u201cWhat do you do if someone tries to mess with you?\u201d He\u2019s looking at me, expecting the kind of advice I usually give during our breaks at home. My mind races. Should I step in and steer us away, keeping him safe like a protective sibling? Or do I let him face the situation, offering guidance but not interference, like a good mentor would? The weight of both roles presses on me, and I can feel my heart pounding as we approach the corner, torn between shielding him and letting him learn."}
