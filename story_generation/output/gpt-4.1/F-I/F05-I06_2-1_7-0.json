I knew that look\u2014something was weighing on her. As her husband, I wanted to be there, to listen, to share my own worries and invite her to do the same. We\u2019d promised each other open communication, especially when life felt heavy. But as I sat down, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the articles my mentor had suggested. They weren\u2019t due for weeks, but I knew he\u2019d ask about them soon, and I wanted to show initiative, to prove I was serious about my growth. I felt the pull\u2014my wife needed me now, but so did my ambition, my commitment to my mentor. My mind raced, torn between the urge to open up to my wife and the pressure to get a head start on the reading. I could almost hear both voices in my head, each expecting something different, each certain their need was more urgent. I sat there, heart pounding, caught between the person I wanted to be for her and the person I wanted to become for myself."}
