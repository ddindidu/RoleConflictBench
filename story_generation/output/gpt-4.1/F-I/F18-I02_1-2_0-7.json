My sister\u2019s texts were frantic, full of worry about her final exam tomorrow. She needed me to listen, to reassure her, to remind her she was smart enough to get through this. I could almost hear her voice trembling, and I knew how much she counted on me to be her anchor when things got rough.\n\nAt the same time, my girlfriend\u2019s messages were sharp, frustrated. We\u2019d argued about money again, and she wanted to talk it out tonight, to finally resolve the tension that had been building all week. She expected me to be present, to help fix things between us, to show her that our relationship mattered.\n\nI stared at the screen, feeling pulled in two directions. My sister needed comfort, my girlfriend needed resolution. Both were counting on me, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out who needed me more, and what it would mean to let the other down."}
