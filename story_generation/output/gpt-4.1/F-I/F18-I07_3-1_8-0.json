I glanced at the time, feeling the familiar tug of responsibility. My manager always emphasized the importance of being present, even for routine meetings, and I knew my absence would be noticed, even if the session was recorded. As I typed a quick message to let my team know I might be a minute late, I saw my brother step off the curb, eyes glued to his phone, not noticing the car speeding down the street. My heart leapt into my throat. I was torn\u2014should I shout and grab him, risking being late and possibly missing something important at work, or trust that he\u2019d be fine and focus on my professional obligations? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention at the exact same moment."}
