My family\u2019s annual holiday lunch was today, a tradition my parents cherished. Every year, we gathered around the table, shared stories, and laughed over old memories. My parents expected me to be there, to honor our family\u2019s values and keep the tradition alive. But at the same time, my work email pinged\u2014a reminder for the team meeting scheduled at the exact same hour. This meeting wasn\u2019t just routine; it was the only chance to hear crucial project updates, and my manager had stressed the importance of everyone\u2019s participation. I could already imagine my colleagues\u2019 faces if I missed it, the subtle disappointment, the risk of being left out of decisions. My heart pounded as I weighed the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations against the professional responsibility tugging at me. I felt torn, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
