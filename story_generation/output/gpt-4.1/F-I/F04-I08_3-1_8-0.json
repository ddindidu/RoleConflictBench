He looked upset, and I remembered our argument from last night. As his brother, I knew I should take this chance to talk things out, to show him respect by addressing our misunderstanding openly. But just as I was about to call out to him, I noticed that he was walking with Mark, a guy I only knew as an acquaintance from class. Mark caught my eye and gave a small, friendly nod. I felt the pressure to respond in kind, to keep things light and approachable, as acquaintances do. But Sam glanced at me, his expression uncertain, clearly waiting to see if I\u2019d reach out to him or just play it cool for Mark\u2019s sake. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the urge to resolve things with my brother and the expectation to keep things casual with Mark. I hesitated, caught between two roles, unsure which expectation to meet."}
