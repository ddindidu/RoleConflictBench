She\u2019d sounded tired, her voice softer than usual, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check in more often. As their son, I felt responsible for making sure my parents were okay, so I made it a habit to call and ask if everything was going well at home. Today, though, her vague answers left me uneasy, and I couldn\u2019t shake the worry as I locked my door.\n\nJust then, Mrs. Lee from next door stepped into the corridor. She smiled, expecting the usual friendly hello. As her neighbor, I knew I should return her greeting with warmth and maybe even a bit of small talk. But my mind was still tangled with concern for my parents, and I felt my face tighten, my voice falter. I wanted to be polite, but the weight of my other role pressed down on me. I hesitated, caught between the urge to be a good son and the expectation to be a friendly neighbor, unsure which part of me should take the lead in that moment."}
