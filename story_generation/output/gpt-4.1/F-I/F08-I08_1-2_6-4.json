My daughter had called earlier, reminding me how much the grandchildren looked forward to our annual gathering. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the same without you, Mom,\u201d she\u2019d said, her voice warm with expectation. I felt the familiar tug of responsibility, the need to be present, to keep our family\u2019s traditions alive. Just as I was setting out the recipe cards, my phone buzzed again. It was Linda, a woman from my book club. She sounded frazzled, explaining she had to move apartments on short notice and needed help with a few heavy boxes. \u201cI don\u2019t have anyone else to ask,\u201d she admitted, her voice trembling. I could hear the desperation, and I knew how lonely she\u2019d been since her husband passed. My heart ached, torn between the comfort my family expected and the support Linda needed. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my time and care, and I stood in my kitchen, uncertain which way to turn."}
