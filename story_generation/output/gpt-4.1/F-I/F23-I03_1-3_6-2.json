I knew how much it meant to him, and I\u2019d promised\u2014promised\u2014that I\u2019d make it happen. But the price tag gnawed at me, especially now, when every dollar mattered. I was supposed to keep us afloat, to make sure the bills were paid and the fridge was full.\n\nFrom the living room, I heard my partner\u2019s quiet sobs. She\u2019d barely spoken since the funeral, her grief a heavy fog that filled the house. She needed me\u2014needed my comfort, my presence, my understanding. I wanted to be there for her, to hold her hand and let her know she wasn\u2019t alone. But my mind kept drifting to Jamie, to the promise I\u2019d made, and the money I wasn\u2019t sure I could spare.\n\nI felt torn in two, pulled by love and duty in opposite directions. My heart ached with the weight of both their needs, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
