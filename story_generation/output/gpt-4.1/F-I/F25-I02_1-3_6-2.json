My mom and stepdad had been arguing more lately, and I knew they needed me to check in, to ask if everything was okay, to be the steady presence that kept our fragile home from splintering. I could hear my mom\u2019s voice in my head, soft but tired, \u201cThank you for caring, it means a lot.\u201d \n\nBut my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from my girlfriend. She was devastated, barely able to get out of bed since her brother died last week. She needed me, too. She needed me to listen, to hold her, to be her anchor in a storm that I couldn\u2019t calm. \n\nI stared at the screen, torn. If I called my mom, I\u2019d be letting my girlfriend down when she needed me most. If I went to my girlfriend, I\u2019d be abandoning my parents, who were counting on me to hold things together. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out who needed me more, and who I\u2019d have to disappoint."}
