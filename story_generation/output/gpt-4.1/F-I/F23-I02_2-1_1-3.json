My partner and I had finally found a week where both of us had a few free evenings\u2014something that hadn\u2019t happened in months. She\u2019d been hinting at how much she missed our quiet dinners, just the two of us, and I wanted to make it special. But then, a reminder popped up: my stepson\u2019s open class at school was scheduled for Thursday evening. His mom couldn\u2019t make it, and he\u2019d already asked if I\u2019d be there. I could hear his hopeful voice in my head, and I knew how much it meant to him that I showed up for these things. At the same time, I could picture my girlfriend\u2019s face, lighting up at the thought of a night out together. Both roles pulled at me\u2014one expecting me to be a reliable parent, the other wanting me to be a loving partner. My chest tightened as I realized that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down. I sat there, torn, unable to decide which expectation I should meet."}
