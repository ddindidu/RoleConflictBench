As his sister, I knew how much it meant to him for all of us to be there, cheering him on, making him feel special. I wanted to be present, to laugh and share stories, to make this milestone unforgettable for him.\n\nBut just as I was setting up the decorations, my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Lee next door. She was expecting an important package and asked if I could receive it for her since she\u2019d be out all afternoon. She\u2019s always been a good neighbor\u2014watering our plants when we\u2019re away, checking in during storms. I knew how much she relied on me for these small favors, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down.\n\nStanding in the living room, I felt torn. My brother\u2019s celebration was about to start, but the delivery window for Mrs. Lee\u2019s package overlapped perfectly. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing on me, unsure how I could possibly be the supportive sister and the dependable neighbor at the same time."}
