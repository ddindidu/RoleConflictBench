My phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you call? It\u2019s about Sam.\u201d My grandson, Sam, had been struggling lately, and I knew this wasn\u2019t just a casual check-in. As a grandfather, I felt a deep responsibility to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and advice. My family expected me to be present, especially in times of crisis.\n\nBut just as I reached for my phone, a calendar reminder popped up\u2014team meeting in five minutes. This wasn\u2019t an ordinary meeting; the agenda was packed with project updates that would shape our next quarter. My manager had stressed the importance of everyone\u2019s participation, and my colleagues counted on me for input. Missing it would mean falling behind, letting the team down.\n\nI stared at the phone, then at my computer, my heart pounding. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my family needing my support, my team needing my presence. I felt torn, caught between the urgent needs of those I care about most and the professional responsibilities I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
