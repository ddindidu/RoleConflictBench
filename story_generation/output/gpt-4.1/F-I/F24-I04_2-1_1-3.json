My stepbrother, Ethan, trudged in, his shoulders slumped and eyes red. I knew something was wrong\u2014he barely glanced at me before heading straight to his room. As his step-sibling, I felt the weight of Mom\u2019s words echoing in my mind: \u201cYou two need to look out for each other, especially when things get tough.\u201d I wanted to go after him, to be there and listen, just like I promised I would.\n\nBut just as I stood up, my phone buzzed. It was Mia, my best friend, texting frantically: \u201cCan you hop on a video call? I\u2019m losing my mind with this bookshelf. The instructions make no sense and I need help.\u201d She\u2019d just moved into her new apartment, and I\u2019d told her I\u2019d always be there when she needed me. I could almost hear the frustration in her messages.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. Ethan needed me now, but so did Mia. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I felt my chest tighten, unsure which way to turn."}
