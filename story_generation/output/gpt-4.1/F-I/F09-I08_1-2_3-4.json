I could see her trying, sometimes forgetting, and I knew how important it was to be patient and consistent, to show her the right way. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was Lisa, an old acquaintance, asking if I could come over and help her move some boxes into her new apartment. She sounded desperate\u2014her usual helpers had canceled, and she didn\u2019t know who else to call. I glanced at my daughter, who was waiting for my next prompt, and felt a knot tighten in my stomach. I wanted to be there for Lisa, to show her she could count on me, but I also knew that leaving now would mean cutting short this precious teaching moment with my child. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat there, phone in hand, torn between being the mother my daughter needed and the friend Lisa hoped I would be."}
