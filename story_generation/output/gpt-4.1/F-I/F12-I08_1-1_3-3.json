My husband has been working late all week, and I know he expects me to help keep the house running smoothly. The laundry has been piling up for days, and I promised myself I\u2019d finally fold it tonight. Just as I reach for the first shirt, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s Maya, an acquaintance from my yoga class. She\u2019s in town for the evening and asks if I can recommend a good restaurant nearby. I know she\u2019s counting on me for a quick, thoughtful reply\u2014she\u2019s mentioned before how much she values local tips, and I don\u2019t want to let her down. But my mind is split. If I stop to write a detailed message, the laundry will sit untouched, and I\u2019ll feel guilty for not sharing the load at home. If I ignore Maya, I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m not living up to the helpful, friendly person I want to be. My hands hover over the laundry and my phone, heart tugged in two directions, unsure which role to answer first."}
