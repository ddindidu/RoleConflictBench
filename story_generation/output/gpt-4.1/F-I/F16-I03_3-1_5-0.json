My spouse had just reminded me that his parents would arrive in two hours, and the house still looked like a whirlwind had passed through. He expected me to help scrub, vacuum, and make everything perfect\u2014after all, we always presented a united front when family visited. But my phone buzzed again. My boyfriend had texted, \u201cRough day. Can we talk?\u201d I knew he needed me to listen, to be gentle and supportive, to help him unwind from the stress of his job. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. If I focused on the chores, I\u2019d be letting my boyfriend down when he needed comfort. If I called him, I\u2019d be leaving my spouse to handle everything alone, risking disappointment and tension before the relatives even arrived. My heart pounded as I stared at the bubbles, torn between the two people who needed me in completely different ways, unsure which demand to answer first."}
