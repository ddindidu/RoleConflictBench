Her voice trembled as she explained her car had broken down on the highway, and she was alone, scared, and needed me to come get her right away. My heart raced\u2014I knew how much she depended on me, especially in emergencies like this. But as I tiptoed toward the door, my younger sister, Lila, called out from her room. She\u2019d had a rough week, and tonight we\u2019d promised to talk things through, to listen and be patient with each other, to rebuild the respect that had frayed between us. I could hear the hope in her voice, the expectation that I\u2019d finally be there for her. I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between the urgent need of my friend and the quiet, fragile trust of my sister. The weight of both their expectations pressed on me, and I felt my chest tighten as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be the sister Lila needed and the friend Maya counted on\u2014all at the same time."}
