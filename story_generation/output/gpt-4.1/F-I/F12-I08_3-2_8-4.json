He wanted us to be completely honest about our finances, to lay everything out so we could make a big decision together. I knew he expected me to be open, to share every detail, even the uncomfortable ones. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the message. It was from Lisa, an acquaintance from work. She was moving apartments and needed help with a few boxes. She rarely asked for anything, and I knew she expected me to say yes, to be supportive and show up for her. I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. If I helped Lisa, I\u2019d have to postpone the talk with my husband, risking his trust. If I stayed, I\u2019d let Lisa down when she needed a hand. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how to be the wife who communicates openly and the acquaintance who offers support, all at the same time."}
