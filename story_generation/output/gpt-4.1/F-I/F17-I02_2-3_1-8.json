We\u2019ve been at it for hours, voices rising and falling, neither of us willing to back down. She\u2019s waiting for me to say something, to fix this, to prove that I care enough to fight for us. But the phone keeps ringing. It\u2019s Sunday\u2014my parents expect my call, the one I never miss, where I tell them about my week and ask about Dad\u2019s new hobby or Mom\u2019s garden. I can almost hear my mother\u2019s gentle voice, her disappointment if I don\u2019t call. My girlfriend\u2019s arms are crossed, her jaw set, and I know if I turn away now, it\u2019ll only make things worse. My chest tightens, torn between the comfort of my parents\u2019 familiar love and the urgent, fragile tension in the room. I want to be a good son, but I also want to be the boyfriend she needs right now. The phone keeps ringing, and I\u2019m frozen, caught between two worlds, unable to move."}
