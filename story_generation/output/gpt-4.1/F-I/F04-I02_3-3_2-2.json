My sister\u2019s text was frantic\u2014she needed to talk, her voice trembling through the phone as she confessed she\u2019d just lost her job and didn\u2019t know how to face our parents. At the same moment, my girlfriend called, her sobs barely contained as she told me her uncle had passed away unexpectedly. I could hear the pain in both their voices, each reaching out to me, expecting comfort and support. As a brother, I\u2019d always promised my sister I\u2019d be there, no matter what. As a boyfriend, I knew how much my girlfriend needed me to hold her together right now. My heart pounded, torn between the two people who needed me most, both expecting me to drop everything and be their anchor. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of their needs pressing down on me, paralyzed by the impossibility of being in two places at once."}
