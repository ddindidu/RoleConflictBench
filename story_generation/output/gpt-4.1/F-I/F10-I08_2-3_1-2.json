They always looked forward to these calls, and I knew how much it meant to them to hear about my week and to share their own stories. Just as I was about to dial, I noticed someone I recognized from work\u2014Sarah\u2014sitting nearby, her shoulders shaking as she wiped away tears. We weren\u2019t close, but we\u2019d always exchanged friendly greetings. I hesitated, torn. My parents would be waiting, probably already glancing at the clock, expecting to hear my voice. But Sarah looked so alone, and I felt a tug to go over, offer comfort, and be the approachable, kind person I always tried to be. My thumb hovered over the call button as I glanced between the phone and Sarah, my heart pounding with the weight of both expectations."}
