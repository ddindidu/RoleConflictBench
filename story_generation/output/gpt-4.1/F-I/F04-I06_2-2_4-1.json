Mom\u2019s making your favorite.\u201d I knew how much these family dinners meant, especially to my younger brother, who always looked up to me to be there. But my mentor\u2019s email echoed in my mind\u2014he wanted the code sample done before our next meeting, and I was nowhere near finished. He\u2019d been clear about the importance of meeting deadlines, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down or seem uncommitted. My family expected me to show up, laugh, and be present, but my mentor expected focus and progress. The pressure built in my chest as I tried to decide which expectation to meet, feeling guilty no matter which way I leaned."}
