As a parent, I knew I needed to teach him discipline, to gently but firmly correct his behavior before he knocked something over or disturbed other shoppers. I could feel the eyes of strangers on me, expecting me to step in, to show I was raising him right.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my mentee, apologizing for missing another deadline. She was struggling, and I\u2019d promised to help her develop better time management skills. As her mentor, I wanted to encourage her growth, to be available and supportive, especially when she reached out for help.\n\nI felt torn, pulled between the immediate need to guide my child and the responsibility to support my mentee. Both roles demanded my attention, both expected me to be present and wise. My heart raced as I weighed the urgency of each, feeling the pressure of being needed in two places at once, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
