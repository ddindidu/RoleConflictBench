It\u2019s the only time I have.\u201d My heart sank. Tonight was the annual family dinner, the one night my parents insisted everyone be home, dressed in our traditional clothes, sharing stories and laughter. My mother had already called twice to remind me to come early and help set the table, and my father always looked forward to my presence, saying it kept the family bond strong.\n\nBut my mentor rarely had free time, and I knew how much she valued commitment and punctuality. She\u2019d told me before that showing up when it mattered was the mark of a true professional. I could almost hear her voice, calm but firm, reminding me that opportunities don\u2019t wait.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. If I missed the dinner, I\u2019d disappoint my family and break a tradition that meant so much to them. If I declined the meeting, I might lose my mentor\u2019s trust and a rare chance to learn. My hands trembled as I hovered over the reply button, caught between two parts of myself."}
