The family gathering was something I\u2019d promised not to miss\u2014my daughter had reminded me twice, and my wife had already started preparing my favorite dish. I could almost hear the laughter, the clatter of dishes, the warmth of being surrounded by those I love. But my phone buzzed again, a reminder from my mentor: the project summary needed to be finished tonight, before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation with upper management. I knew how much my mentor counted on me, how this assignment could shape my future opportunities. My laptop sat open on the desk, the cursor blinking impatiently on a half-finished paragraph. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the living room where my family waited, and toward the silent demand of my professional growth. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down, each one important, each one asking for all of me."}
