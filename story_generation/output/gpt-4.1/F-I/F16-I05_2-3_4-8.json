Tonight, clean clothes were a necessity\u2014tomorrow was a big day for both of us, and the kids had activities that required their uniforms. But my phone buzzed again, a desperate message from Maya, my mentee. Her voice trembled through the text: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this. Can you talk?\u201d Her project presentation was tomorrow, and I knew how much she\u2019d invested in it, how much she relied on my guidance to steady her nerves and help her grow. My spouse expected me to be present, to share the load at home, while Maya needed me to be the mentor I\u2019d promised to be. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, my heart torn between the comfort of my family and the responsibility I felt for Maya\u2019s future. I stood in the hallway, laundry basket in hand, phone glowing in the other, paralyzed by the impossible choice before me."}
