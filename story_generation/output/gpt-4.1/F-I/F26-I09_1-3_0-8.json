She looked at me with those searching eyes, hoping for advice on how to handle the nerves and the unknowns. I felt the familiar warmth of being needed, of sharing the lessons I\u2019ve gathered over the years. Just as I was about to answer, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mrs. Lee next door. She reminded me about her package deliveries while she\u2019s away, especially with the building\u2019s power outage tomorrow. She asked if I could keep an eye out, since the intercom won\u2019t work and the packages might be left in the hallway. I could sense the urgency in her words; she\u2019s always been a good neighbor, and I know how much she relies on me. My granddaughter waited, expecting my undivided attention, while my neighbor counted on my reliability. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure how to be present for both at the same time."}
