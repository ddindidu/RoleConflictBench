As a father, I knew I had to teach him that stealing was wrong, that actions have consequences. I wanted to sit him down, talk through what happened, and help him understand why honesty matters. But as soon as we stepped into the apartment, I saw the boxes\u2014our old books and winter coats\u2014still stacked in the corridor. The HOA inspection was in an hour, and I\u2019d already gotten a warning about blocking the emergency exit. As a neighbor, I was expected to keep the shared space clear, to respect everyone\u2019s safety and the building\u2019s rules. I could feel the pressure mounting: my son needed me, but so did my neighbors. If I left the boxes, I\u2019d be inconsiderate and risk a fine for everyone. If I dealt with the boxes, I\u2019d miss the chance to address my son\u2019s mistake in the moment. My heart pounded as I stood between the corridor and my son, torn by the demands of being a good father and a responsible neighbor."}
