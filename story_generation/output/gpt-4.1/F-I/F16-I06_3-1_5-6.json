My spouse was bustling around, reminding me that the living room still needed dusting and the guest room sheets had to be changed before the relatives arrived tomorrow. \u201cWe need to get this done together,\u201d they said, their voice tinged with urgency. I nodded, but my mind was elsewhere\u2014my mentor had just emailed, reminding me that their office hours were open this afternoon, a rare window I\u2019d been waiting for to discuss my project. I knew how much my mentor valued punctuality and initiative; missing this chance could set me back weeks. But at home, my absence would mean leaving my spouse to shoulder everything alone, something we\u2019d promised not to do. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, my heart racing as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, torn between being a supportive partner and a dedicated mentee."}
