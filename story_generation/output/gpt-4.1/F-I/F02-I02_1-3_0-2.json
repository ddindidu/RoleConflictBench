It\u2019s almost three\u2014time to pick up the kids from school. I promised them I\u2019d be there, front and center, just like I always am. They\u2019re counting on me, and I can already picture their faces scanning the crowd, searching for mine. But my phone vibrates again, and I see another message from Emily. She\u2019s barely holding it together after her brother\u2019s sudden passing, and she needs me now more than ever. I can hear her voice trembling from our last call, the way she asked if I could come over, just to sit with her, to help her breathe through the pain. I feel torn in two, pulled by the weight of my children\u2019s expectations and the raw need in Emily\u2019s voice. My mind races, guilt gnawing at me no matter which way I turn. I want to be the father my kids can rely on, but I also want to be the partner who doesn\u2019t let Emily down when she\u2019s at her lowest. I stand frozen, keys in hand, caught between two worlds that both need me right now."}
