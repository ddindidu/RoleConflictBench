We\u2019d argued about something trivial, but it had spiraled into a bigger misunderstanding. I knew I needed to talk to her, to clear the air and rebuild the respect we\u2019d always tried to maintain. Just as I was gathering my thoughts, my phone buzzed. It was my best friend, Sam. His voice was shaky, and I could tell he\u2019d been crying. \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now,\u201d he said, barely holding it together. I felt torn\u2014my sister was in her room, probably waiting for me to make the first move, but Sam rarely reached out like this. I wanted to be the brother who communicates openly and resolves conflicts, but I also wanted to be the friend who listens and supports when it matters most. My heart pounded as I stared at the hallway leading to my sister\u2019s room, then back at my phone, Sam\u2019s voice still echoing in my ear."}
