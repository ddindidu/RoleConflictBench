She\u2019s been hinting all week that it\u2019s my turn to fold, and I know she\u2019s right. I promised we\u2019d share the load, and I want to be the kind of husband who keeps his word. But just as I reach for a towel, my dog starts barking wildly at the hallway door. Through the thin walls, I hear our neighbor\u2019s footsteps pause, then hurry away. I wince, remembering the polite but pointed note about noise last month. I should leash the dog, calm him down, maybe even apologize in person. But the laundry isn\u2019t going to fold itself, and I can\u2019t ignore my wife\u2019s expectations either. My chest tightens as I stand between the couch and the door, torn by the demands of being a good husband and a considerate neighbor, knowing I can\u2019t do both at once."}
