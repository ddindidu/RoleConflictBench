He\u2019s chattering about his day, but my phone buzzes with a message from my boyfriend: \u201cCan you call? I really need you.\u201d He\u2019s had a rough day at work, and I know he\u2019s counting on me to listen, to reassure him. My stepbrother suddenly darts toward the curb, chasing a stray soccer ball, and I instinctively reach out, grabbing his backpack to pull him back. My heart pounds\u2014my mom always says I need to look out for him, keep him safe. But my boyfriend\u2019s messages keep coming, each one more desperate. I feel torn, my mind racing. If I stop to call my boyfriend now, I can be there for him when he needs me most, but I can\u2019t take my eyes off my stepbrother, not even for a second. The weight of both their needs presses on me, and I can\u2019t figure out how to be what they both expect at the same time."}
