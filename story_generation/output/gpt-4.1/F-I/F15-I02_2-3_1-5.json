Saturday was circled in red\u2014my daughter\u2019s open class at school. She\u2019d been practicing her lines for weeks, her eyes shining every time she asked, \u201cWill you be there, Dad?\u201d I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But then, my phone buzzed. A message from Mia: \u201cCan\u2019t believe it\u2019s our last weekend together before I leave. Let\u2019s make it special?\u201d She\u2019d been so patient with my busy schedule, and now, with her move abroad looming, she deserved my undivided attention. I felt torn in two. My daughter needed me in the audience, cheering her on, making her feel important. Mia needed me to show her she mattered, that our relationship was worth holding onto across the distance. Both deserved all of me, but I only had one Saturday. The weight of their expectations pressed on my chest, and I wondered how I could possibly choose without letting someone down."}
