My friend\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and I answered to the sound of her sobs. She could barely speak, her words tumbling out between gasps\u2014her father had just been rushed to the hospital. I sat up, heart pounding, listening as she poured out her fear and confusion. She needed me, needed someone to anchor her in the storm. But as I glanced at the clock, anxiety twisted in my stomach. Tomorrow, my husband and I had to wake up early to clean the house from top to bottom\u2014his relatives were coming, and he\u2019d made it clear how important it was that everything be perfect. He was counting on me to help, to share the load, and I knew he\u2019d be frustrated if I was exhausted or distracted. My friend\u2019s pain tugged at me, but so did the unspoken expectation at home. I felt torn, caught between being the supportive friend she needed and the reliable partner my husband expected. The weight of both roles pressed down on me as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
