My parents chimed in, asking if I could clear my schedule and join them. I could see the hope in their eyes\u2014they wanted all of us together, something we hadn\u2019t managed in months. I nodded along, feeling the warmth of belonging, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the project deadline at work was looming. My part was crucial, and if I didn\u2019t finish by Sunday night, my teammate\u2019s work would be delayed, setting off a chain reaction for the whole team. I could already imagine the disappointment in my manager\u2019s voice and the frustration of my colleagues. My family\u2019s laughter filled the room, but inside, I felt a knot tightening in my stomach. I wanted to be the supportive brother, present and engaged, but I was also a responsible colleague, counted on to deliver. The two worlds pulled at me, each expecting my full commitment, and I sat there, torn, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
