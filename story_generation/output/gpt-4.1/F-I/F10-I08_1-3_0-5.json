Call us when you can!\u201d I smiled, feeling a familiar warmth, but also a twinge of guilt\u2014I hadn\u2019t called home in over a week. I knew how much it meant to my parents to hear from me, especially on weekends. I started typing a quick reply, promising to call later, when another notification popped up. It was Jamie, an acquaintance from work. \u201cHey, sorry to bother you, but my car broke down on Maple Road. Could you help me out?\u201d I stared at the two messages, my thumb hovering uncertainly. I wanted to be the reliable daughter who checked in, but Jamie sounded stranded and anxious. I could almost hear my mom\u2019s gentle disappointment if I put off calling again, but I also imagined Jamie waiting alone, hoping someone would come. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014family connection versus being a supportive acquaintance\u2014feeling pulled in two directions, unsure which need to answer first."}
