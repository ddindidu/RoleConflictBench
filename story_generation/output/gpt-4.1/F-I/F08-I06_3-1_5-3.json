We really need you right now.\u201d My heart tightened. As a grandmother, I knew how much my family counted on me, especially in moments like this. I pictured my grandchildren\u2019s anxious faces, the way they\u2019d look for comfort in my arms. I wanted to be there, to offer the steady presence they expected.\n\nBut as I reached for my keys, I noticed the email notification from my mentor. I\u2019d promised to keep her updated on any challenges, no matter how small. I did have a question about some terminology in the project, but it wasn\u2019t urgent. Still, she always emphasized open communication, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down or seem careless.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. My family needed me now, but my mentor expected me to be proactive and transparent. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each pulling me in a different direction. I hesitated, caught between the demands of being a reliable grandmother and a responsible mentee, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
