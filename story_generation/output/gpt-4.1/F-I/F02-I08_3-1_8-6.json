My mind, though, was elsewhere\u2014calculating numbers, thinking about the home loan repayment looming in two months. I needed to make sure we were financially secure, and every expense, every decision, felt heavy with consequence. Later that evening, I found myself at a small gathering with some acquaintances. The conversation turned to a mutual colleague who had made some questionable decisions at work. The group leaned in, eager for details, and someone nudged me, knowing I had inside information. I felt the weight of their expectations, the unspoken pressure to join in, to share what I knew. But I remembered my own values\u2014never to speak ill of others, never to gossip. At the same time, I wondered if sharing something might help me fit in, maybe even open doors to opportunities that could help with my financial worries. The two roles pulled at me\u2014father, provider, and acquaintance, expected to be discreet and trustworthy. My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do next."}
