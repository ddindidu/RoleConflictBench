The family would arrive soon for our monthly gathering, and I could already hear my grandchildren\u2019s laughter echoing in my mind. I wanted to be present, to listen to their stories, to hold my youngest granddaughter on my lap as she told me about her new puppy. \n\nBut my phone buzzed on the counter. It was Maya, my mentee, with a string of anxious messages about her upcoming presentation. She\u2019d always said my advice calmed her nerves, and I knew she was counting on me to help her through this. I\u2019d promised to be available, even if just for a few minutes during my breaks. \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me. My family expected my undivided attention, especially today. Maya needed my guidance, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between the warmth of my family and the responsibility I felt as a mentor. I stood in the kitchen, phone in hand, wrestling with what to do next."}
