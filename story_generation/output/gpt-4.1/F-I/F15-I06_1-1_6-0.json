He\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, and I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d get it if things went well this month. But as I stared at the price, my mind wandered to the spreadsheet I\u2019d made last night, tallying up bills and groceries. I wanted to give him the joy of a new game console, but I also needed to make sure we\u2019d be okay until my next paycheck.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a message from my mentor, reminding me about the optional reading she\u2019d suggested. \u201cNo rush, but it\u2019ll help with your growth,\u201d she\u2019d said. I knew she expected me to take initiative, to show I was serious about my development. I wanted to impress her, to prove I was committed, but every spare moment seemed to slip away between work and parenting.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my son\u2019s hopeful eyes, my mentor\u2019s encouraging words. I wanted to be everything for both of them, but right now, I wasn\u2019t sure how."}
