My little sister had just texted me, her excitement leaping off the screen\u2014she\u2019d landed her dream job, and the family was gathering tonight to celebrate. She wanted me there, front and center, like always. I could almost hear her voice, \u201cYou promised you\u2019d be there for my big moments.\u201d But as I read her message, my girlfriend sat quietly beside me, her eyes red and distant. She\u2019d lost her father only days ago, and every night since, I\u2019d held her as she cried, trying to be her anchor. She hadn\u2019t asked for much, just my presence, my comfort. Now, she looked at me, searching for reassurance that I wouldn\u2019t leave her alone tonight. My heart twisted. My sister needed me to celebrate with her, to show her she mattered. My girlfriend needed me to help her through the darkest days she\u2019d ever known. I felt pulled in two, the weight of both their expectations pressing down, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
