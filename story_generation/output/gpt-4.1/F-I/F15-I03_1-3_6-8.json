My son\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, his eyes wide with hope as he reminded me, \u201cYou promised, Mom. You said I\u2019d get the Nintendo if I did well in school.\u201d I wanted to keep that promise, to see his face light up, but the price tag was more than I could really afford right now. I needed to be responsible, to make sure we had enough for rent and groceries.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again, another message from Emily. The argument we\u2019d had last night still burned in my chest. She said she felt like I was always distracted, never fully present, and now she was questioning if we should even be together. I knew I needed to call her, to talk things through, to show her I cared enough to fight for us. But how could I be a good girlfriend when my mind was split in two, torn between the needs of my child and the demands of my relationship? I stared at the store entrance, my heart pounding, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which way to turn."}
