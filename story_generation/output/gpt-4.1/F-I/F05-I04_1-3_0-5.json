She didn\u2019t seem too upset, but I could tell she needed me to be present, to listen and reassure her. I nodded, trying to offer comfort, when my phone buzzed. It was a frantic message from my best friend\u2014his car had broken down on the highway, miles from home, and he sounded desperate for help. He needed me right away. My wife looked at me expectantly, waiting for me to respond to her story, her eyes searching for the support she\u2019d come to rely on. At the same time, my friend\u2019s texts kept coming, each one more urgent than the last. I felt torn, my chest tightening with the weight of both their needs. I wanted to be the supportive husband she deserved, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore my friend in his moment of crisis. The pressure of choosing between them pressed in on me, and I sat there, phone in hand, heart pounding, unsure of what to do next."}
