My stepdad had emphasized how important it was for me to be there, especially since my stepsister was coming home from college. I knew how much it meant to them, to have all of us together, to show that we were a real family. But just as I was about to reply, my mentee, Jordan, called. His voice trembled as he explained he\u2019d received a job offer\u2014one that could change everything for him\u2014but he had only a few hours to decide. He needed me to walk him through the pros and cons, to help him see what he couldn\u2019t on his own. I could hear the anxiety in his voice, the trust he placed in me as his mentor. My heart pounded as I looked at the clock, realizing both the dinner and Jordan\u2019s deadline overlapped. I felt torn, the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing on one side, and the responsibility to guide Jordan on the other. I sat there, phone in hand, paralyzed by the impossible choice between being the step-sibling they wanted and the mentor Jordan needed."}
