I nodded, promising I\u2019d be there, even as my phone buzzed in my pocket.\n\nIt was Mia, my girlfriend. Her message was short, but I could sense the tension: \u201cCan we talk about what happened? I just want to clear things up before the weekend.\u201d I knew she was upset about the mix-up with our plans, and I also knew she expected me to help smooth things over, to show her that our relationship mattered.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions\u2014my family needed me to honor their traditions, to prove I belonged, while Mia needed me to be present and attentive, to fix what was broken between us. My chest tightened as I stared at my phone, torn between the weight of family expectations and the responsibility I felt toward Mia."}
