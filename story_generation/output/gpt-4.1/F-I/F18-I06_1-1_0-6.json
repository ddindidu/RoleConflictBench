She barely looked up when I entered the room, but I could feel the tension radiating from her. I knew she was anxious about her final exam tomorrow\u2014she\u2019d always counted on me to help her calm down before big tests. I wanted to sit beside her, listen to her worries, and remind her she was more than capable. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my mentor\u2019s office hours were starting soon. He\u2019d made it clear that these windows were the best time to ask questions and get feedback, and I\u2019d been struggling with a project I desperately needed his guidance on. I felt torn, standing in the hallway, hearing my sister\u2019s shaky sighs while picturing my mentor waiting for students who respected his time. The weight of both expectations pressed on me\u2014my family needed me, but so did my future. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which door to walk through."}
