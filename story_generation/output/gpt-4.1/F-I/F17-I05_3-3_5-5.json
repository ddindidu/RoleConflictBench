It means a lot to Grandma.\u201d My family expected me to step up, to honor our traditions and show respect for the generations before me. I could already picture my parents\u2019 proud faces, the weight of their hopes pressing on my shoulders.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a desperate text from my mentee at work. \u201cI\u2019m stuck. If I mess this up, the whole project could fail. Can you walk me through it?\u201d As a mentor, I was supposed to be available, to guide and support, especially when the stakes were high. I knew how much my mentee depended on me, how much trust they placed in my experience.\n\nThe ceremony and the project overlapped. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by people who needed me for different reasons. My heart ached with the fear of letting someone down, of failing to live up to the expectations that defined who I was\u2014both as a child and as a mentor."}
