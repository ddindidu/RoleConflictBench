The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy weight pressing on my chest. I knew I had to tighten our budget, maybe pick up extra shifts, anything to make sure my family stayed afloat. Just as I was mapping out expenses, my phone buzzed. It was Sam, my old friend, texting: \u201cRough day. Everything feels pointless. Can you talk?\u201d I stared at the message, guilt creeping in. Sam had always been there for me, and I knew he needed someone to listen, to care. But my mind was tangled in numbers and deadlines, the pressure of being a reliable step-parent gnawing at me. I wanted to be the friend Sam deserved, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore the responsibility to my family. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between sending a comforting reply and diving back into the financial maze. The two worlds pulled at me, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
