We\u2019d been practicing with his toy cars, and I was determined to help him understand how important it is to be polite and considerate. Just as he was about to hand me a car, the doorbell rang. I peeked through the window and saw our new neighbor, Mrs. Kim, standing outside with a small cake in her hands and a hopeful smile on her face.\n\nI knew I should greet her warmly, make her feel welcome, and perhaps invite her in for a chat. That\u2019s what a good neighbor would do, especially since she\u2019d gone out of her way to introduce herself. But my son was watching me, waiting for my reaction, and I worried that if I dropped everything to focus on Mrs. Kim, I\u2019d lose this precious teaching moment. My mind raced\u2014should I prioritize my son\u2019s lesson or the neighborly gesture? I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing on me, unsure which role to fulfill first."}
