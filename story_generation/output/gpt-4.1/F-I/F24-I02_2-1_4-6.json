I feel like you\u2019re avoiding me.\u201d My heart sank. We\u2019d just had a small argument about our weekend plans, and I knew she expected me to call and sort things out. But downstairs, I could hear my stepdad calling everyone to the table. Tonight was our first family dinner since my mom remarried, and I was supposed to be there, smiling, making an effort to bond with my new step-siblings. My mom had made it clear how important this was to her, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. But I also couldn\u2019t ignore my girlfriend, not when she was upset and needed reassurance. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one part of me wanting to be the supportive boyfriend, the other not wanting to disappoint my family. My phone buzzed again, and my stepdad\u2019s voice grew louder, calling my name. I stood frozen at the top of the stairs, torn between the two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
