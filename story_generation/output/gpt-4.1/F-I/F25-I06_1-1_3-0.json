She handed me a box of ornaments, her eyes warm but expectant. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn to hang the family star,\u201d she said, a tradition I\u2019d only recently been invited to join. I wanted to fit in, to show I cared about these rituals that meant so much to her and my step-siblings. But my mind kept drifting to the stack of articles my mentor had emailed me that morning\u2014optional reading, he\u2019d said, but I knew he\u2019d ask about them at our next meeting. I wanted to impress him, to prove I was serious about my future. As laughter echoed from the living room, I felt torn. If I slipped away to read, I\u2019d miss the chance to bond with my new family. If I stayed, I\u2019d fall behind and risk disappointing the one person guiding my career. The ornaments felt heavy in my hands, and I wondered how I could possibly be both the step-child they wanted and the mentee I needed to be."}
