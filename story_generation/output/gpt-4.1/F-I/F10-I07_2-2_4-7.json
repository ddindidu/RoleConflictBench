My mother was setting out the special dishes for our family\u2019s annual tradition, her voice warm but firm as she reminded me how important it was to be present and honor our customs, especially this year. I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation, the unspoken hope that I would carry on what generations before us had cherished. But my phone vibrated again, and I glanced at the screen\u2014three new messages from my team at work. They were waiting for my input to move forward on a project, and I knew the delay was holding everyone back. I could almost hear the impatience in their words, the professional expectation that I would be responsive and reliable. My heart pounded as I looked from my family, gathered and expectant, to the glowing screen demanding my attention. I felt torn, the pressure of both worlds pressing in, each side needing me in a way that seemed impossible to reconcile."}
