Everyone gathered around, eager to hear what he had to say. As a grandfather, I knew how important it was to be present, to show him that his achievements mattered to us all. Just as he began, my phone buzzed with a message from an acquaintance who was also at the gathering. She leaned over and whispered, \u201cDid you hear about Mark\u2019s latest project? It was a disaster. I can\u2019t believe they let him present.\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. I wanted to focus on my grandson, to give him my full attention and support, but I also felt the pressure to respond to my acquaintance without encouraging her negativity. I didn\u2019t want to be drawn into gossip, yet I didn\u2019t want to seem rude or dismissive either. The expectations of being a supportive grandfather and a polite acquaintance pulled me in opposite directions, leaving me caught in a moment of silent turmoil."}
