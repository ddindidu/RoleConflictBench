She\u2019d been quiet all evening, her silence heavy with unspoken worries. I knew I should reach out, ask her what was wrong, and share my own work frustrations like we promised we would. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my friend, short and cold. My heart sank as I remembered the careless joke I\u2019d made earlier, the one that clearly stung more than I realized. I needed to call him, to apologize and explain myself before the misunderstanding grew. My wife glanced at me, her eyes searching for comfort, while my phone vibrated again in my hand. I felt torn, pulled by the need to be present for her and the urgency to fix things with my friend. Both expected honesty and openness from me, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My chest tightened as I weighed whose pain to address first, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in."}
