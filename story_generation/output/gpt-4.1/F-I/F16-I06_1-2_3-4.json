We agreed to share chores, but lately, work has swallowed my evenings. The laundry is my turn, and it\u2019s been sitting there for days. I know my spouse expects me to step up, to show I care about our home as much as they do. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: my mentor\u2019s office hours are ending soon. I\u2019ve hit a wall on my project, a technical glitch I can\u2019t solve alone. My mentor always says to reach out early, not to let problems fester. I promised I\u2019d communicate, but I haven\u2019t yet. I feel pulled in two directions\u2014if I fold the laundry, I\u2019ll miss my chance to talk to my mentor and risk falling behind. If I call my mentor, the laundry will sit there, another broken promise at home. My chest tightens as I stand between the couch and my laptop, torn by the expectations of being a good partner and a responsible mentee, wishing I could be both at once."}
