My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cThis needs to be perfect for tomorrow\u2019s evaluation.\u201d The pressure was mounting; I knew my future in the program depended on this assignment. Just as I tried to focus, my granddaughter appeared in the doorway, her eyes red and voice trembling. \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? I really need your advice.\u201d She sat beside me, clutching her hands, waiting for the wisdom she believed only I could give. My heart ached to comfort her, to be the steady presence she needed.
