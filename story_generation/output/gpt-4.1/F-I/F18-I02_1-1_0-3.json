I\u2019m freaking out about this exam.\u201d I could almost hear the panic in her words, and I knew how much she relied on me when things got tough. I wanted to be there for her, to reassure her that she could do it, just like I always had. But then another message popped up, this time from my girlfriend: \u201cHey, which night do you want to go out? I\u2019m free all week, and I miss you.\u201d She\u2019d been looking forward to us finally having some uninterrupted time together, and I\u2019d promised we\u2019d make it special. I stared at the two conversations, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. My sister needed my support, but my girlfriend deserved my attention too. I wanted to be the dependable brother and the caring boyfriend, but I couldn\u2019t see how to be both at the same time. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to say, torn between two people I loved, each needing me in a different way."}
