I knew something was wrong\u2014they\u2019d been quiet all evening. Remembering how important open communication is in our marriage, I reached out, gently asking if everything was okay. As they began to share their worries about work and some personal concerns, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my friend: \u201cRough day. Everything feels pointless. Can you talk?\u201d I felt a pang of guilt. My friend always counted on me to listen, to be there when things got tough. But right now, my spouse needed me too, expecting my full attention and understanding. I glanced between my spouse\u2019s anxious eyes and the glowing phone screen, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in. My heart raced as I tried to figure out how to be the partner my spouse needed and the friend my friend depended on, all at the same time."}
