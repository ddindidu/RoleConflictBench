My daughter had called twice this week, reminding me how much the grandkids missed me, how they wanted to show me their new drawings and play board games. I could already picture their eager faces, the laughter, the warmth of being surrounded by family. But as I set the phone down, I heard the soft sigh from the living room. My partner sat slumped on the couch, eyes red, shoulders heavy. The news from work had hit hard, and he needed me\u2014needed my comfort, my presence, my reassurance that things would be okay. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by love and duty. My family expected me to be the doting grandmother, present and joyful. My partner needed me to be his anchor, his support. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest, and I found myself frozen, unsure which part of my heart to follow."}
