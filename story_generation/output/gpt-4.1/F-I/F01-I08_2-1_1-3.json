His shoulders slumped, and I could sense the weight he carried, the kind that only comes from feeling lost. My instinct as a grandfather was to reach out, to share a story from my own youth, to offer the kind of guidance I wished someone had given me. I wanted to tell him that it\u2019s okay to feel uncertain, that life has a way of working itself out, but I hesitated, not wanting to push him before he was ready.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed.
