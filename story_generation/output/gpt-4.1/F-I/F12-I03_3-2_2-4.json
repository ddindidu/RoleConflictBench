My husband\u2019s voice from the other room was shaky\u2014he needed me, more than ever, as he faced the darkest days he\u2019d ever known. He\u2019d barely eaten, barely slept, and I was the one he clung to for comfort, the only person he trusted to hold him together. But my phone screen glowed with a message from my boyfriend: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you tonight. It\u2019s our only chance this week.\u201d He\u2019d been looking forward to this evening, planning every detail, hoping for laughter and closeness before I disappeared into work and travel. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014one expecting unwavering support, the other craving my undivided attention and joy. My heart twisted as I realized I couldn\u2019t be fully present for both. I stared at the wall, torn, the demands of love pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which part of myself I could bear to disappoint."}
