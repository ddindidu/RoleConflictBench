I stared at the screen, guilt prickling at my chest. For years, I\u2019d made it a point to check in with my parents every evening, sharing little stories and answering their questions right away. It was our ritual, and I knew how much it meant to them, especially since I moved out.\n\nBut tonight, I was sitting beside my girlfriend on her couch, her eyes red and distant. She hadn\u2019t said much since the funeral, and I could feel her pain in the heavy silence between us. She needed me here, present and attentive, not distracted by my phone. Every time I glanced at my messages, I saw her shoulders tense just a little more.\n\nI felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions. My parents expected me to be the attentive son, always reachable, always sharing. My girlfriend needed me to be her anchor, to listen and hold her through her grief. I wanted to be both, but right now, I didn\u2019t know how. My phone buzzed again, and I just sat there, paralyzed, caught between the two worlds that needed me."}
