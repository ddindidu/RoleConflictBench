My stepdad had texted, \u201cRough day. Can we talk?\u201d He rarely reached out like this, and I knew he needed someone to listen, someone to ask if he was really okay. That\u2019s what I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be for him\u2014a step-child who cared, who checked in, who made sure he didn\u2019t feel alone in this new family.\n\nBut just as I was about to call him, my girlfriend\u2019s message popped up: \u201cCan you come over? I really need you.\u201d She\u2019d had a terrible day at work, her boss\u2019s harsh words still echoing in her head. I could picture her curled up on the couch, waiting for me to hold her, to tell her she was more than her job, that I was there for her no matter what.\n\nMy heart twisted. Both needed me, both expected me to be their support. I felt pulled in two directions, guilt and worry tangling inside me as I tried to decide who needed me more right now."}
