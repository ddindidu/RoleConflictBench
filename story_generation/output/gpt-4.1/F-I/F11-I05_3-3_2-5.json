I really need you.\u201d He never reached out unless it was serious. I glanced at the clock\u2014just ten minutes before my scheduled video call with my mentee, Priya, who was about to present her first big project. She\u2019d been anxious all week, and I\u2019d promised to walk her through the final steps, making sure she didn\u2019t miss any crucial details. \n\nBut my brother\u2019s text tugged at me. We\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, especially when things got tough. I could hear his voice in my head, shaky and uncertain, needing his sister. At the same time, I pictured Priya, waiting for my guidance, depending on my experience to help her avoid a mistake that could set her back months. \n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the urge to call my brother and the responsibility to support Priya. Both needed me, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The weight of their expectations pressed down on me, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between sister and mentor."}
