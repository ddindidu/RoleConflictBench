She needed to choose between two projects, each with its own risks, and she looked to me for comfort and guidance. I could see the worry in her eyes, and I knew she wanted me to listen, reassure her, and help her feel less alone in her decision. Just as I reached for her hand, my phone buzzed. It was a message from an acquaintance I\u2019d met at a community event last month. She was outside, crying, needing someone to talk to after a personal loss. She said she didn\u2019t know who else to turn to. I felt torn\u2014my wife needed my full attention and support, but I also didn\u2019t want to turn away someone in distress who saw me as approachable and kind. My heart pounded as I looked from my wife\u2019s anxious face to the glowing phone screen, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
