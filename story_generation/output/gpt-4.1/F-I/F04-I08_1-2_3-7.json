My sister suggested a movie, my mom wanted to visit grandma, and my dad was eager for a hike. I knew they expected me to join in, to be present and enthusiastic, especially since I\u2019d missed the last few family outings. I nodded along, trying to show I was listening, but my phone buzzed with a message from a group chat. An acquaintance, Mark, had just sent a snide remark about a colleague\u2019s recent project, poking fun at their mistakes. The chat was lighting up with reactions, and I felt the unspoken pressure to join in, to be part of the group and not seem aloof. But I hated gossip, and I knew it was wrong to talk behind someone\u2019s back. My family\u2019s voices grew louder, waiting for my input, while my phone vibrated again, Mark asking for my opinion. I felt torn, caught between being the supportive brother my family wanted and the agreeable acquaintance my friends expected. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, unsure which role to answer first."}
