My daughter had been planning this for weeks, and my grandchildren were eager to show me their new drawings. I could already imagine their laughter and the warmth of being surrounded by family. As I gathered my things to leave, I ran into Linda from my book club, sitting on a bench outside my building, her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. She looked up, her eyes red and pleading for comfort. I knew she\u2019d recently lost her job, and she\u2019d always said I was easy to talk to. I felt the weight of her expectation\u2014someone to listen, to be present, to offer a kind word. My phone buzzed with a message from my daughter: \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see you, Grandma!\u201d My heart twisted. I wanted to be the grandmother my family needed, but I also didn\u2019t want to turn away from someone in pain. I stood there, torn, the demands of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which path to take."}
