He\u2019d just started his new job, and the family group chat was buzzing with congratulations and questions. I knew how much it meant to him\u2014and to everyone else\u2014that I stay involved, that I show I care by responding quickly, maybe even calling to hear his excitement firsthand. But just as I started typing, I heard a soft sniffle from the living room. My partner sat curled up on the couch, eyes red, shoulders trembling. She\u2019d gotten harsh feedback at work, and I could see how much it hurt her. She needed me to listen, to hold her, to remind her she was more than her job. My thumb hovered over the phone, torn between sending a cheerful message to my grandson and going to comfort the woman I love. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each urgent in its own way, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure which need to answer first."}
