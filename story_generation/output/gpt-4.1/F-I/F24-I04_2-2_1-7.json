I knew something was wrong\u2014he barely looked at me before heading to the couch, curling up in silence. As his step-sibling, I felt the weight of expectation: I should sit beside him, listen, and offer comfort, especially since Mom always says we need to be there for each other. But just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my best friend, sharp and cold: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that to me.\u201d My heart sank. She\u2019d misunderstood my earlier text, and I knew if I didn\u2019t call her right now, things could get worse. I stood frozen, torn between the brother who needed me and the friend who expected honesty and immediate communication. My chest tightened as I glanced from my phone to my stepbrother, feeling the impossible pull of both roles, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to choose them first."}
