She\u2019d just been passed over for a promotion she\u2019d worked hard for, and she needed someone to talk to. As her brother, I wanted nothing more than to comfort her, to listen and reassure her that she was amazing no matter what. But as her mentor\u2014something that started when she\u2019d asked for career advice a few months ago\u2014I felt the pressure to offer her practical guidance, to help her see what she could do differently next time. \n\nShe was crying, and I could hear the vulnerability in her words. She needed her brother, someone to lean on, not a mentor dissecting her choices. Yet, I also knew she respected my opinion and might expect me to help her figure out her next steps. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I found myself torn, unsure whether to simply listen or to start offering advice. My heart ached as I wrestled with what she needed most from me in that moment."}
