It\u2019ll be great to have the whole family together this year.\u201d My mom had already told me how much it would mean to her if I joined, especially since it was the first holiday since she remarried. I knew my stepbrother was looking forward to it too, hoping we\u2019d finally bond over something other than awkward dinners.\n\nBut as I scrolled through my work emails, I saw a reminder from my manager about the project I\u2019d been assigned. The deadline was still a week away, and the team could technically keep moving without my part for a few days, but I\u2019d promised to have it done before the weekend. I could almost hear my colleague\u2019s voice: \u201cWe\u2019re counting on you to keep things on track.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my family expecting me to be present, my team expecting me to deliver. My stomach twisted as I tried to figure out how I could possibly meet everyone\u2019s expectations without letting someone down."}
