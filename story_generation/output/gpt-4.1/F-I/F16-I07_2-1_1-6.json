My partner paced in front of me, eyes anxious, voice trembling as they described the difficult choice looming at their job. I could see how much they needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure, to help them sort through the mess of options. I wanted to be fully present, to offer the comfort and advice they deserved. But my phone kept lighting up. A colleague had sent a message, nothing urgent, just a request to confirm some details for an upcoming project. They\u2019d written, \u201cNo rush, just when you have a moment,\u201d but I knew the unspoken expectation: colleagues should respond promptly, even to non-urgent matters. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the warmth of my partner\u2019s need and the professional courtesy expected at work. My mind raced, guilt prickling at the thought of letting either side down. I gripped my phone, heart pounding, caught between the roles I was supposed to play."}
