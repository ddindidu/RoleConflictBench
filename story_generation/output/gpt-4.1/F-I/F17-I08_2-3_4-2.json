They reminded me how crucial it was to honor our customs, especially now, when so much seemed to be changing in the world. I nodded, feeling the weight of their expectations settle on my shoulders. Later that day, I ran into Jamie, an acquaintance from school, sitting alone on a bench, tears streaming down her face. She looked up at me, her eyes red and pleading for comfort. I knew she needed someone to talk to, someone open and understanding. But I also remembered my parents\u2019 words\u2014how I should be careful about sharing our family\u2019s ways with outsiders, how I should always represent our values. I felt torn, wanting to be the friendly, supportive person Jamie needed, but also feeling the pressure to protect my family\u2019s traditions. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between the warmth of compassion and the chill of duty."}
