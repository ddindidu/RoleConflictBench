She wanted the whole family to gather at my house\u2014my grandson had just won a big award at school, and they wanted to celebrate together. As a grandmother, I felt a warm sense of pride and a deep desire to make this moment special, to be present and attentive, to bake his favorite cookies and listen to every detail of his achievement.\n\nBut just as I was setting out the plates, my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Lee next door. She reminded me that her medication delivery was scheduled for today, and she\u2019d be at work. She asked if I could keep an eye out and sign for the package, as missing it would mean waiting days for a redelivery. I know how much she relies on me for these little things, and I don\u2019t want to let her down.\n\nStanding in my kitchen, I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my family\u2019s joy and my neighbor\u2019s need\u2014wondering how I could possibly be enough for both at the same time."}
