Just an hour ago, I\u2019d noticed my stepdad looking unusually quiet at dinner, and Mom had barely touched her food. I knew I should check in, ask if everything was okay, like I always tried to do. They counted on me to be the one who noticed, the one who cared enough to ask. But as I scrolled through my messages, I saw a text from my friend, Jamie. She\u2019d read my joke in the group chat the wrong way, and now she was hurt\u2014really hurt. I could feel the weight of her disappointment through her short, cold reply. I needed to call her, explain, apologize, fix things before it got worse. But if I disappeared into my room to make that call, I\u2019d be letting my parents down, ignoring the tension I could feel building in the house. My chest tightened as I stared at the phone, torn between the two people who needed me, both expecting me to be there for them, both right now."}
