My mom\u2019s voice still echoed in my mind\u2014she\u2019d just confided in me about her worries at work, her voice trembling as she asked if I thought she was doing the right thing. I could see how much she needed me to listen, to reassure her, to be the steady presence she\u2019d always tried to be for me. I wanted to be there for her, to offer the comfort she was seeking.\n\nBut my phone kept lighting up with messages from my girlfriend. She was upset about our weekend plans falling through, and I could sense her frustration growing with every unanswered text. I knew she expected me to call, to talk things out, to show her that I cared enough to resolve even the smallest misunderstandings.\n\nMy chest tightened as I stared at the screen, torn between the urge to go back to the living room and sit with my mom, and the need to pick up the phone and call my girlfriend. Both of them needed me right now, in different ways, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure which role to step into first."}
