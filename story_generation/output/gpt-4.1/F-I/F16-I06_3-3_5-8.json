My spouse\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me that the relatives would arrive in just a few hours and the house still needed vacuuming and dusting. I nodded, feeling the weight of shared responsibility settle on my shoulders. At that moment, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my mentor. \u201cI can meet now, but only for the next hour before my flight.\u201d My heart raced. This was the only chance to discuss my project before the deadline, and I knew how much my mentor valued punctuality and commitment. I glanced at the half-cleaned hallway, the pile of laundry, and then at my phone. My spouse\u2019s expectation to work together, to not leave them alone with the chores, clashed sharply with my mentor\u2019s rare availability. I felt torn, guilt rising no matter which way I leaned. The pressure built inside me, my mind racing through possible excuses and compromises, but I knew I couldn\u2019t meet both expectations at once."}
