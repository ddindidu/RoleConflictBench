My spouse sits across from me, eyes searching mine, waiting for me to share everything about the medical bill that arrived today. We promised each other honesty, especially about money and health, but my mind keeps drifting to my mentee, who just called in a panic about tomorrow\u2019s big interview. She\u2019s counting on me to review her presentation, to give her the confidence she needs to take the next step in her career. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing down\u2014my spouse needs my full attention and openness, but my mentee needs my guidance right now. I want to be present for both, but the clock is ticking, and I can\u2019t split myself in two. My heart aches as I wrestle with the impossible choice, torn between the person I love and the person who looks up to me."}
