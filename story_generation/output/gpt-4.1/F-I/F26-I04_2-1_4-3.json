Jamie wants to show everyone his science project!\u201d I could hear the excitement in my grandson\u2019s voice, and I knew how much these moments meant to him\u2014and to me. Just as I was about to get up, my phone buzzed. It was my old friend, Mark, his message popping up: \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m losing my mind with this bookshelf. The instructions make no sense and I could really use your help.\u201d I stared at the phone, torn. My family expected me to be present, to share in Jamie\u2019s big moment, but Mark rarely asked for help, and I knew he was struggling after his recent move. My heart tugged in both directions, the weight of being needed by two people I care about pressing down on me. I stood there, caught between the laughter in the next room and the silent plea on my screen, unsure which way to turn."}
