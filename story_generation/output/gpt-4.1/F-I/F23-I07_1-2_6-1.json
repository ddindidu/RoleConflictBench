The subject line\u2014\u201cCritical Project Updates\u201d\u2014made it clear this wasn\u2019t one I could skip. My manager had already stressed the importance of everyone\u2019s input, and I knew missing it would mean falling behind, maybe even letting the team down. But as I glanced at my phone, a text from my stepson popped up: \u201cAre we getting the Nintendo today? You promised.\u201d I could almost hear his hopeful voice, see the excitement in his eyes. I\u2019d promised him, and after months of saving, today was the day. But the only time I could get to the store before it sold out was during the meeting. My partner was counting on me to keep my word, to show I was reliable, that I cared about our family\u2019s happiness and stability. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014between being the dependable colleague my team needed and the step-parent my family deserved. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment in my stepson\u2019s face against the frustration of my coworkers. I sat at my desk, paralyzed, knowing I had to choose."}
