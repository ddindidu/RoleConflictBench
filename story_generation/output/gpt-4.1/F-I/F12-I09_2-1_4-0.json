My husband had mentioned he needed his shirt clean for an early meeting, and the kids\u2019 uniforms were buried somewhere in the pile. I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014if I didn\u2019t get the laundry done now, tomorrow morning would be chaos. Just as I was about to start the machine, I heard footsteps in the corridor. Mrs. Lee, our neighbor, appeared with her usual warm smile. She greeted me, expecting a friendly chat, as she always did. I knew she valued these small exchanges, and I didn\u2019t want to seem rude or distant. But every minute spent talking meant less time for the laundry, and I could already imagine the disappointment on my family\u2019s faces if their clothes weren\u2019t ready. I stood there, torn between the polite neighborly greeting and the pressing household task, feeling the tension knotting in my chest as I tried to decide what to do next."}
