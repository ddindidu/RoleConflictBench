The groceries were running low, and the kids\u2019 shoes had holes in them. As a mother, I felt the weight of making sure there was enough for dinner, enough for rent, enough for everything. I glanced out the window and saw the shared trash bins by the curb. Tomorrow was pickup day, but the bins were only half-full. I knew the unspoken rule in our building: don\u2019t overfill the bins with your own trash, leave space for everyone. But I had a bag of old clothes and broken toys to throw out\u2014things I could maybe sell, but I needed the space and the little bit of cash from recycling the cans inside. My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always watched the bins closely, and I could already imagine her frown if I filled them up. I felt torn, the pressure of my family\u2019s needs pushing against the expectation to be a good neighbor. My hands trembled as I held the bag, heart pounding, caught between what my family needed and what my neighbors expected."}
