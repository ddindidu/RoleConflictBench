I was supposed to look out for him\u2014Mom always reminded me, \u201cYou\u2019re the older one, make sure Jamie\u2019s safe.\u201d I kept glancing at the street, making sure he didn\u2019t wander too close to the curb. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was Priya, a girl from my math class. She messaged, \u201cHey, you know any good places to eat around here? My cousin\u2019s visiting.\u201d I knew she\u2019d helped me with homework before, and I didn\u2019t want to seem rude or unhelpful. But as I started typing a reply, Jamie darted ahead, chasing after a stray cat. My heart pounded. Should I call out to him, or finish helping Priya first? I felt torn\u2014if I ignored Jamie, I\u2019d be failing as a step-sibling, but if I ignored Priya, I\u2019d be letting down someone who counted on me. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between two roles I couldn\u2019t fulfill at once."}
