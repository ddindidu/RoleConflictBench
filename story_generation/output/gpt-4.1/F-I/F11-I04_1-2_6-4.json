She\u2019d been looking forward to it, and I knew how much it meant to her that I included her in my plans, especially since she sometimes felt left out. As we were putting on our shoes, my phone buzzed. It was my friend, panicked\u2014she was on her way to the airport and thought she\u2019d left her passport at home. She begged me to check her place and, if I found it, rush it to her before her flight. I could hear the desperation in her voice; she\u2019d helped me through so much, and I knew she\u2019d do the same for me. My sister was already at the door, smiling, excited for our outing. I felt torn, the weight of both their expectations pressing on me. I wanted to be the reliable friend in a crisis, but I also wanted to be the sister who made her sibling feel valued and included. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
