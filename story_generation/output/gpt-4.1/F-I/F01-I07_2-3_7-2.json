She\u2019d just started her new job, and her excitement was contagious. My daughter had asked if I could join a family video call that evening to hear all about it, to show support and keep our family\u2019s tradition of celebrating milestones together. At the same time, my laptop chimed with a calendar reminder: the final team meeting before we locked in the project\u2019s direction. My manager had stressed the importance of everyone\u2019s input, and my colleagues were counting on me to represent our department\u2019s concerns. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family expecting my presence and warmth, my team needing my focus and expertise. My heart tugged toward my granddaughter, wanting to be the supportive grandfather she deserved, but my mind raced with the responsibility I owed my colleagues. I stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, torn between two parts of myself, each demanding more than I could give."}
