My stepmom looked at me, her eyes hopeful, expecting me to chime in and help make the plans. I knew how much it meant to her that I joined in, that I made an effort to be part of this new family. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the team meeting at work was scheduled for the same time. My manager had stressed how important it was for everyone to be there, especially since the project updates wouldn\u2019t be shared later. I could already imagine the disappointment in my stepmom\u2019s face if I excused myself, and the frustration from my boss if I missed the meeting. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the conversation at the table, but my mind kept drifting to the office, to the expectations waiting for me there. I felt torn, caught between wanting to belong at home and needing to prove myself at work, unsure which demand I could afford to let down."}
