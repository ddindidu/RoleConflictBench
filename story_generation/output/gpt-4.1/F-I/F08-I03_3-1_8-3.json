It\u2019s about Jamie.\u201d My heart tightened. Jamie, my grandson, had been struggling lately, and now something serious was happening. As a grandmother, I felt the weight of expectation\u2014my family counted on me to be present, to listen, to help hold things together. I knew I should call right away, maybe even visit, to show I was there for them.\n\nBut just as I was about to dial, my boyfriend texted: \u201cHey love, which night this week should we do our movie date? I\u2019m free all week, can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d We\u2019d both been so busy, and finally, we had time to reconnect. He\u2019d been looking forward to this, and so had I. I could almost hear his disappointment if I postponed again.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. My family needed me, but so did he. The pressure built in my chest as I weighed their needs against my own longing for connection. I wanted to be everything for everyone, but right now, I didn\u2019t know how."}
