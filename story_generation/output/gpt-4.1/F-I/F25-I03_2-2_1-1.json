I know they wait for my call, eager to hear about my week, wanting to feel included in my life. I promised I\u2019d always keep them updated, especially after moving out. But tonight, as I glance across the room, I see my boyfriend slumped on the couch, eyes red, shoulders tense. He just got off a call with his boss\u2014another project rejected. He hasn\u2019t said much, but I can feel the heaviness in the air. I want to sit beside him, hold his hand, let him know I\u2019m here, that he\u2019s not alone in this. But my phone keeps buzzing, and I imagine my parents waiting, maybe worrying if I don\u2019t call on time. My heart pulls in two directions\u2014toward the family that raised me and the person I love. I stand in the hallway, phone in hand, torn between comforting him and keeping my promise to them, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
