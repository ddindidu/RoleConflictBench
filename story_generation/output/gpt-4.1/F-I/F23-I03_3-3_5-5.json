I was supposed to be teaching him right from wrong, guiding him with patience and firmness\u2014wasn\u2019t that what a good step-parent did? But today was supposed to be different. It was the last weekend before Mark, my boyfriend, left for his new job overseas. We\u2019d planned every minute: brunch, a walk in the park, a movie\u2014just us, making memories before months apart. Now, with Jamie\u2019s wide, guilty eyes on me, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I confronted Jamie, the afternoon would be ruined, and Mark would be disappointed, maybe even angry that I\u2019d spoiled our precious time. But if I let it go, I\u2019d be failing Jamie, letting him think stealing was okay. My mind raced, torn between the child who needed guidance and the man I loved who needed me present, joyful, and undistracted. I could feel my throat tighten as I tried to decide which role I owed more in this impossible moment."}
