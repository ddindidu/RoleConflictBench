My daughter\u2019s voice trembled as she explained the family emergency\u2014my grandson was sick, and everyone needed me there for support. I could hear the worry in her words, and I knew how much my presence meant to them, especially in moments like this. At the same time, my phone vibrated again. It was a message from my old friend, Tom. We\u2019d planned to meet after weeks apart, but now he was confused about where we were supposed to meet. He sounded frustrated and uncertain, and I knew if I didn\u2019t reply right away, he might think I was ignoring him or, worse, that I didn\u2019t care. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the urgent need to be with my family and the responsibility to clear things up with Tom. Both needed me, both expected me to be there for them, and I felt the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
