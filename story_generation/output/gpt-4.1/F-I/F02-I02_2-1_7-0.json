As a father, I knew I had to make sure there was enough for groceries, rent, and the kids\u2019 school fees. My wife had asked me earlier if I could pick up some extra shifts this week, and I could see the worry in her eyes. The pressure to keep everything afloat pressed down on me, heavy and relentless.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my girlfriend, Sarah. She\u2019d had a rough day at work and wanted to talk. I could almost hear the fatigue in her words, the way she needed me to listen, to be there for her. She always said I was her safe place, and I wanted to be that for her. But the clock was ticking, and I had to decide\u2014do I stay and crunch numbers, maybe call my boss about overtime, or do I step outside, call Sarah, and give her the comfort she needs? My heart pulled in two directions, each role demanding more than I felt I could give."}
