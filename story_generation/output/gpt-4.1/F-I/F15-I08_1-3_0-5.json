My kids would be waiting, scanning the crowd of parents for my face, eager to tell me about their day. Picking them up was a promise I rarely broke\u2014a small but important ritual. Just as I started the car, my phone buzzed. It was Mark, an old acquaintance. His message was urgent: his car had broken down on a deserted stretch of road, and he needed help. He sounded desperate, and I knew he didn\u2019t have many people to call. I stared at the phone, torn. My children expected me to be there, to show up as I always did. But Mark was stranded, counting on me to come through. The weight of both expectations pressed on my chest, and I felt my hands tremble on the steering wheel. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and no matter what I chose, someone would be let down."}
