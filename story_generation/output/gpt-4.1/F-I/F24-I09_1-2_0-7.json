His final exam was tomorrow, and I could see the anxiety etched on his face. As his step-sibling, I knew he needed me to be there, to listen and reassure him, maybe even quiz him on the material. But my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Lee, our elderly neighbor. The storm advisory had her worried, and she asked if I could check in on her later and maybe help secure her balcony furniture. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me\u2014my stepbrother\u2019s silent plea for comfort and Mrs. Lee\u2019s need for reassurance and practical help. I wanted to be the supportive sibling he could rely on, but I also knew how much Mrs. Lee depended on me, especially with her family living far away. My heart raced as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, torn between the demands of family and neighborly duty, wishing I didn\u2019t have to choose."}
