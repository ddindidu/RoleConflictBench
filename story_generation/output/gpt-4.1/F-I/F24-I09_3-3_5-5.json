The HOA had posted a notice: inspection tomorrow, clear all personal items from shared spaces. I knew the rules\u2014neighbors expected everyone to keep the halls clear, especially before inspections. But just as I was about to start moving the boxes, my stepmom called from the living room. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving for Grandma\u2019s in an hour. Don\u2019t forget, you promised to help decorate and set up before everyone arrives.\u201d Family events were a big deal, and as the new step-sibling, I felt the pressure to show I belonged, to be present and helpful. But if I left the boxes, the neighbors would be upset, and we could get fined. If I stayed to move them, I\u2019d be late for the family trip, letting down my stepmom and stepbrother. My heart pounded as I stood between the corridor and the front door, torn by the weight of both expectations, unsure which role I was about to disappoint."}
