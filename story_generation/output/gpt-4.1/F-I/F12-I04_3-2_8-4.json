We were finally talking about our finances\u2014something we\u2019d both avoided for too long. He looked at me, waiting for my honest thoughts, and I knew he expected me to be fully present, to share everything openly so we could make the right decisions together. My phone buzzed, and I glanced down to see a frantic message from my friend, Sarah. She was on her way to the airport and thought she\u2019d left her passport at home. She begged me to check and, if it was there, to rush it to her before her flight. I could hear the panic in her voice, and I knew she was counting on me. My husband\u2019s eyes searched mine, waiting for my answer about our future, while my friend\u2019s crisis demanded immediate action. I felt torn, my heart racing as I tried to figure out how to be the wife he needed and the friend she depended on, both at the same time."}
