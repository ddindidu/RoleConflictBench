I really need you right now.\u201d I could hear the strain in her words, and I knew she wouldn\u2019t reach out unless it was serious. As her brother, I\u2019d always promised to be there, no matter what. But just as I was about to call her, my mentor\u2019s email notification popped up. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to let me know if you hit any snags,\u201d she\u2019d written earlier. I did have a small question about some terminology in the project, and she expected me to communicate openly, even about minor things. I stared at my phone, torn. My sister needed me, and I wanted to be the supportive brother she could rely on. But I also didn\u2019t want to let my mentor down or seem uncommunicative. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt my chest tighten as I tried to decide who needed me more in this moment."}
