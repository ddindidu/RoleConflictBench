His car had broken down on the side of the highway, and he sounded scared and desperate. \u201cCan you come get me? Please, man, I don\u2019t know who else to call.\u201d I glanced at the clock, then at the closed door to my little brother\u2019s room. Just an hour earlier, we\u2019d had a heated argument about something trivial, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d talk to him tonight, clear the air, and rebuild the trust that had been shaken between us. I knew he was still awake, probably waiting for me to knock and make things right. But Mark needed me now, and I could hear the panic in his voice. My mind raced, torn between being the brother who keeps his word and the friend who shows up in a crisis. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen in the hallway, heart pounding, caught between two people who needed me in different ways."}
