My family laughed and shared stories, and I knew how much it meant to them that I was here, present and engaged, upholding the traditions that had shaped us for generations. My mother caught my eye and smiled, her silent way of saying she was glad I\u2019d made it home for the holiday. Just as I reached for another helping, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced down\u2014an urgent message from my manager, asking for a quick confirmation on a project detail for an important external partner. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family expected my undivided attention, to honor our time together, but my team at work needed me to be responsive, to keep things moving. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the warmth of tradition and the demands of my professional life, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
