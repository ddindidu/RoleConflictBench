She was anxious about a big decision at work, her voice trembling as she asked, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m making the right choice?\u201d I knew she needed me to be her anchor, to listen and offer encouragement, to remind her of her strengths. I reached for her hand, but before I could speak, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mark, an acquaintance from work, inviting me to join a group chat. I opened it, only to see a string of messages criticizing a colleague\u2019s recent project. Mark asked, \u201cWhat do you think? Didn\u2019t she mess up?\u201d I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t join in or speak ill of someone behind their back. But Mark was waiting for my response, and my wife was waiting for my support. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between being the supportive husband my wife needed and the principled acquaintance I wanted to be."}
