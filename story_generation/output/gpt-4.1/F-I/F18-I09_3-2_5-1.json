My sister had just texted, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we\u2019re all meeting at Grandma\u2019s for the holiday dinner at six. Mom says it\u2019s really important this year.\u201d I knew how much these family gatherings meant, especially since we hadn\u2019t all been together in months. I could already picture my parents\u2019 disappointed faces if I showed up late or missed it.\n\nBut as I was about to leave, I spotted my new neighbor, Mrs. Kim, struggling with her groceries. I\u2019d baked a small cake to welcome her, hoping to make a good impression and start off on the right foot in this new place. She smiled when she saw me, clearly expecting a friendly chat and maybe a cup of tea together. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me\u2014my family waiting, my neighbor hoping for kindness. My heart pounded as I stood there, cake in hand, torn between the warmth of home and the promise of new connections, unsure which door to walk through first."}
