She\u2019s anxious, her hands twisting in her lap, eyes searching mine for reassurance. She\u2019s facing a huge decision at work\u2014her boss wants an answer by morning, and she needs my advice, my encouragement, my full attention. I want to be there for her, to listen and help her sort through her worries, to be the partner she deserves.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with a message from Mrs. Lee, our elderly neighbor. The storm advisory warns of power outages and possible flooding. She\u2019s alone tonight, and I know she relies on me to check in, maybe help her secure her windows or just offer some comfort. I can\u2019t ignore her, not when she\u2019s so vulnerable.\n\nI feel torn, pulled in two directions by people who need me. My wife\u2019s voice trembles as she asks, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d At the same time, I glance at the clock, thinking of Mrs. Lee, wondering if she\u2019s scared or needs help. My heart aches with the weight of both expectations, unsure how to be the husband and neighbor I want to be\u2014at the same time."}
