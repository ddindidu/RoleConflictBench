We\u2019d all agreed to meet up after a long week, and I was glad Mia could join us\u2014she\u2019d been feeling left out lately, and I wanted her to feel included in my life. As we sipped our coffee, one of my work acquaintances, Jenna, leaned in and made a snide remark about another colleague\u2019s recent project, rolling her eyes and inviting us to laugh along. I saw Mia glance at me, waiting to see how I\u2019d respond. She\u2019s always valued honesty and respect, and I knew she expected me to stand up for others, just as I would for her. But Jenna was watching me too, expecting me to join in, or at least not contradict her in front of the group. My stomach twisted. If I spoke up, I risked alienating Jenna and the others, maybe even making things awkward for Mia. But if I stayed silent, I\u2019d be betraying the values my sister and I shared. I could feel both sets of expectations pressing in on me, and I didn\u2019t know which way to turn."}
