The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a weight pressing on my chest. As a step-parent, I knew I had to make sure the family was secure, that nothing slipped through the cracks. Every dollar counted, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t let them down. But my phone buzzed, and I saw her name\u2014my girlfriend, reminding me that this was our last weekend together before she left for months. She wanted to go away, just the two of us, to make memories before the distance set in. I could hear the hope in her voice, the expectation that I\u2019d be present, not distracted or anxious. I wanted to give her that, to be the boyfriend she deserved. But the thought of spending money on a getaway when the loan payment was so close made my stomach twist. I felt torn, pulled between the family that needed my stability and the woman who needed my love, both expecting me to be fully there for them. I stared at the calendar, heart pounding, unsure which part of me I could afford to let down."}
