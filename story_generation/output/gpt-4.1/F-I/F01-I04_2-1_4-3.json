My daughter had gathered everyone, and I could feel the anticipation in the air. This was one of those moments I cherished\u2014being present, listening, and showing my family how much they meant to me. Just as my granddaughter began to speak, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Tom, my old friend. \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m drowning in screws and planks over here. These instructions make no sense.\u201d I knew he\u2019d been struggling since his wife left, and he rarely asked for help. I glanced at my family, all eyes on my granddaughter, and then at my phone, picturing Tom\u2019s frustrated face. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014one toward the laughter and warmth of my family, the other toward a friend in need. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing on me, unsure which part of myself I should honor in this moment."}
