Their eyes searched mine, heavy with worry. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if I should take the offer,\u201d they said, voice trembling. I knew they needed me to listen, to reassure them, to help them see their strengths. I wanted to be the anchor they could lean on, to offer the encouragement they deserved.\n\nLater that evening, I found myself at a small gathering with some acquaintances from work. The conversation turned to the recent decisions made by a colleague\u2014decisions that had affected my partner. The group leaned in, voices low, dissecting every move. Someone turned to me, expecting me to join in, maybe even share some inside perspective. I felt the weight of their anticipation, the unspoken pressure to contribute. But I remembered my partner\u2019s vulnerability, their trust in me. I knew that joining in would betray that trust, but staying silent might make me seem distant or unfriendly to the group.\n\nCaught between the need to support my partner and the expectation to fit in with the group, I felt my chest tighten, unsure of what to do next."}
