Dad barely looked up from his paperwork, sighing every few minutes. I knew they\u2019d been under a lot of pressure lately, and I felt this pull to sit with them, to listen, to be the son they could lean on. But my phone buzzed with a message from Mia: \u201cCan\u2019t wait for tonight! Missed you all week.\u201d We only had this one evening before I\u2019d be away for work, and she\u2019d been looking forward to it, planning our favorite takeout and a movie. I could almost hear her laughter, see her smile. My heart twisted as I stood in the hallway, caught between the living room and the front door, between the people who raised me and the person I loved. Both needed me, both expected me to be there, and I felt the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
