My friend\u2019s name flashes on the screen, and I answer, instantly alert. Her voice is shaky, words tumbling out between sobs about her father\u2019s sudden illness. I sit up, heart pounding, trying to listen, to be the anchor she needs. But as she pours out her pain, my mind drifts to the envelope on my dresser\u2014the one with the money I\u2019ve been saving for weeks. My stepson\u2019s birthday is tomorrow, and I promised him a Nintendo. He\u2019s been counting down the days, his excitement contagious. But the bills have piled up, and I know that money is all I have left for the month. My friend\u2019s voice cracks, and I want to be fully present for her, but anxiety gnaws at me. I feel torn, pulled between being the supportive friend she needs and the responsible step-parent I promised to be. The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, no matter what I do next, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
