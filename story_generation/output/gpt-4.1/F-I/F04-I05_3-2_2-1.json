I really need you.\u201d She never reached out unless it was serious. I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes until my scheduled video call with Maya, my mentee, who was struggling to keep her project on track. She\u2019d been waiting all week for this feedback session, and I knew how much she depended on my guidance. But my sister\u2019s text tugged at me; we\u2019d always promised to be there for each other, no matter what. I could picture her sitting alone, hoping I\u2019d pick up, just as I\u2019d done for her so many times before. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to support my family and the commitment I\u2019d made to Maya. Both needed me, both counted on me, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, caught between the brother my sister needed and the mentor Maya deserved."}
