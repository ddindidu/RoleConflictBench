My stepdaughter had been talking about it for weeks, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there, cheering her on from the back of the classroom. I knew how much it meant to her, especially since her mom couldn\u2019t make it this time. I promised I\u2019d be there, and I wanted to keep that promise.\n\nBut as I was about to leave work, I ran into Lisa by the coffee machine. She leaned in, lowering her voice, and started criticizing Mark\u2019s latest project, picking apart every detail.
