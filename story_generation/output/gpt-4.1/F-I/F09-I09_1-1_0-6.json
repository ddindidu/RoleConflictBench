My children would be finishing school in half an hour, and I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there at the gate, just like always. They looked for me, waving with bright smiles, and I knew how much it meant to them. But just as I was about to grab my keys, my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Lee next door. She was expecting an important package this afternoon and asked if I could receive it for her, since she\u2019d be at work late. She\u2019d helped me so many times before\u2014watering my plants, checking in when I was sick. I didn\u2019t want to let her down. I stared at the door, torn. If I left now, I might miss the delivery, but if I stayed, my kids would be waiting, scanning the crowd for me. The weight of both promises pressed on my chest, and I stood frozen, caught between being the mother my children needed and the neighbor I wanted to be."}
