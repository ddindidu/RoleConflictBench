The inspection was tomorrow, and the corridor outside my apartment was cluttered with my neighbor\u2019s stroller and a few of my own boxes from last week\u2019s online shopping spree. I knew the rules\u2014nothing should block the emergency exit. My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had mentioned she\u2019d be out all evening and asked me to keep an eye on her things. I felt the pressure mounting. My phone buzzed again\u2014Mom, asking for more details about my work presentation. She always expected quick, thoughtful replies, and I didn\u2019t want her to worry. But if I didn\u2019t act fast, the HOA could fine us both, and Mrs. Lee would be upset. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, torn between sending my mom a reassuring message and moving the items before the inspection. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014being the attentive daughter my parents relied on, and the considerate neighbor who respected shared spaces."}
