I know I should stop him\u2014this is the moment to teach him about respect for others and self-control, just like I promised myself I would. But as I reach for his arm, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor. She\u2019s worried about the storm tonight and asks if I could check in on her later, maybe help her bring in her plants from the balcony. I glance at my son, still running, and feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I focus on disciplining him now, I might not have time to help Mrs. Lee before the storm hits. But if I rush home to help her, I\u2019ll miss this chance to teach my son an important lesson. My heart pounds as I stand in the cereal aisle, torn between being the parent my child needs and the neighbor Mrs. Lee is counting on."}
