It means a lot to your father and me.\u201d My family has always placed great importance on tradition, and being asked to lead the ceremony was both an honor and a responsibility. I knew how much it mattered to them, how disappointed they would be if I didn\u2019t step up. But as I sat at my desk, my laptop pinged with reminders from my project manager. The task I was working on was crucial\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish it by Monday, the whole project would stall, and our client would be left waiting. My team was counting on me, and I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides. I wanted to make my parents proud, to show them I valued our traditions, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my colleagues down. My mind raced, torn between the weight of family expectations and the demands of my job, feeling the stress tighten in my chest as I tried to figure out what to do."}
