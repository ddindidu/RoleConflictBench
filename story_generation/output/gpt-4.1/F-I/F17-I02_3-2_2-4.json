Did you eat dinner yet?\u201d I knew she expected a quick reply, maybe even a call, just like every night. It was our routine\u2014she liked to hear about my day, and I always tried to reassure her that I was doing well. But tonight, I was sitting across from my girlfriend at our favorite little restaurant, the only evening we had together before I left for a week-long work trip. She was smiling, telling me about her day, her hand reaching for mine across the table. I could feel her expectation too\u2014she wanted my full attention, to make the most of our limited time. My phone buzzed again, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. I wanted to be present for both of them, but the demands pulled me in opposite directions. My mom\u2019s messages waited, my girlfriend\u2019s eyes searched mine, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of me to let down."}
