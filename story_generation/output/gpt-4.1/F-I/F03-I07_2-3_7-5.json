My father barely spoke during dinner, his eyes fixed on the tablecloth. I knew they needed me\u2014just to sit with them, to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. But as I reached for my phone, it buzzed with a reminder: the project timeline. The report I was responsible for was due tomorrow, and it was the linchpin for the entire team\u2019s delivery to our client. My manager had emphasized how critical it was, how everyone was counting on me. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my parents\u2019 silent plea for comfort, my colleagues\u2019 urgent need for my work. My heart ached with guilt and anxiety, torn between the home that raised me and the team that relied on me. I stood in the hallway, paralyzed, unable to move toward either room, feeling the impossible pull of both roles demanding more than I could give."}
