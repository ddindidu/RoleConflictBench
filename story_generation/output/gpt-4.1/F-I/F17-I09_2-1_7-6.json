Lately, they\u2019ve seemed weighed down, sighing more, talking less. I know they count on me to be present, to listen, to offer a smile or a gentle word when things feel overwhelming. I want to be there for them, especially now.\n\nBut just as I was about to ask Mom if she wanted tea, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Lee next door, reminding me about the package she was expecting. She\u2019s missed a few deliveries lately, and I promised I\u2019d help by receiving it for her if I was home. She trusts me, and I know how much she relies on these little favors, especially since her son moved away.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions\u2014my parents needed me close, maybe just to sit with them, while Mrs. Lee was counting on me to help her out. My heart thudded as I tried to figure out how to be the child my parents needed and the neighbor Mrs. Lee depended on, all at the same time."}
