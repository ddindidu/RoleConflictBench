My spouse gave me a tired smile, clearly hoping I\u2019d help fold the mountain of clothes tonight. I knew we\u2019d both been busy, but the unspoken expectation hung in the air: it was my turn to pitch in. As I set my bag down, my phone buzzed. It was a message from an acquaintance, inviting me to join a quick coffee break at the caf\u00e9 nearby. I hesitated, but agreed, thinking I could use a short escape before tackling the chores.\n\nAt the caf\u00e9, the conversation turned to work, and suddenly my acquaintance leaned in, lowering her voice. \u201cDid you see how badly Mark messed up the report? I don\u2019t know how he still has a job.\u201d I felt uncomfortable. I\u2019d always tried to avoid gossip, believing it was unfair and unkind. But she looked at me expectantly, waiting for me to agree or add my own comment. I could feel the weight of two worlds pressing in: the responsibility waiting at home, and the pressure to fit in socially without betraying my values. My mind raced, torn between what was expected of me in both places."}
