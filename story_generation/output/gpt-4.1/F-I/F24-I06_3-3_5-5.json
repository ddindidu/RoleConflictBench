The argument had escalated, and now no one was willing to compromise. Our deadline was slipping away, and I knew I should reach out to my mentor, just like she always encouraged\u2014\u201cTell me if you hit a wall, don\u2019t wait.\u201d But as I typed out a message, my stepbrother poked his head into my room. \u201cAren\u2019t you coming? Mom\u2019s waiting for everyone to start the holiday dinner.\u201d I could hear laughter and clinking dishes from the dining room.
