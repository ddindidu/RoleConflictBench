The numbers didn\u2019t add up\u2014again. I needed to find a way to cover groceries and rent this month. My job as a junior developer was supposed to help, but the project I was working on had hit a wall. There was a technical issue I couldn\u2019t solve, and I knew I should reach out to my mentor, just as she\u2019d asked me to do whenever I got stuck. But every minute I spent on the phone or writing emails was a minute I wasn\u2019t searching for side gigs or overtime, something to bring in extra cash for my family. My mentor expected honesty and communication, but my family needed stability and money. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn\u2014should I admit my struggle to my mentor and risk looking incompetent, or should I focus on finding immediate ways to support my family, even if it meant falling behind at work? My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
