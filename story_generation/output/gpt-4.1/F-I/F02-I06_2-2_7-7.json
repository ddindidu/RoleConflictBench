It\u2019s the only slot I have today.\u201d My heart thudded. That same hour, my wife had asked me to visit the bank to sort out a payment issue\u2014without it, we wouldn\u2019t have enough for groceries this week. As a father, I felt the weight of my family\u2019s needs pressing down on me. I knew how much they depended on me to keep things afloat, to make sure there was food on the table and bills were paid on time.\n\nBut as a mentee, I also felt the responsibility to respect my mentor\u2019s time. He was busy, and this meeting was a rare chance to get his guidance\u2014something I desperately needed for my career. I could almost hear his voice in my head, reminding me how important it was to be reliable and committed.\n\nI sat at the kitchen table, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the rare opportunity to learn from someone I admired. My hands trembled as I weighed the expectations, feeling the pressure build with every passing minute."}
