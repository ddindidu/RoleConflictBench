My parents had asked me to lead the event this year, a role that carried the weight of our family\u2019s traditions and values. I knew how important it was to them, and I felt the pressure to do everything perfectly, to honor our heritage and not let anyone down. Just then, I noticed an acquaintance approaching from the other end of the hall. We weren\u2019t close, but I knew I was expected to be friendly and approachable, to offer a smile or a greeting. But my mind was so preoccupied with the demands of my family that I felt tense and distracted. I worried that if I didn\u2019t greet them warmly, I\u2019d come off as cold or unfriendly, but if I forced a smile, it would feel insincere. The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I felt caught between the need to uphold my family\u2019s traditions and the social niceties expected of me as an acquaintance. My heart pounded as the distance between us closed, and I wrestled with what to do next."}
