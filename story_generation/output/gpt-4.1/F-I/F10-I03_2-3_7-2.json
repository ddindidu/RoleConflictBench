But as I glanced up, I saw my mom rubbing her temples, my dad sighing heavily as he stared at the bills spread across the counter. They\u2019d both been so quiet lately, their faces drawn and tired. I knew they needed me, too. I wanted to sit with them, to ask what was wrong, to be the daughter they could lean on.
