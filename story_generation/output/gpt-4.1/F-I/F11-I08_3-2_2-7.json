She needed to talk\u2014something had happened at work, and she was feeling overwhelmed. Supporting each other is what we do, so I immediately replied, telling her I\u2019d call during my lunch break. Just then, an acquaintance from another department sat down beside me and started venting about a colleague\u2019s recent project, criticizing their mistakes and hinting at incompetence. I realized with a jolt that the colleague she was talking about was my sister. My acquaintance expected me to join in, or at least listen without protest, as if it were just harmless venting. But as a sister, I felt a fierce urge to defend and support my sibling, especially knowing how much she was struggling. My heart pounded as I sat there, torn between the loyalty I owed my sister and the social expectation to avoid stirring up drama or gossip at work. I could feel my face flush, my mind racing, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossible to reconcile."}
