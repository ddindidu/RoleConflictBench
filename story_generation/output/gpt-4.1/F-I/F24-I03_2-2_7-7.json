He grinned at me, determined to land the trick he\u2019d been practicing for weeks. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to look out for him, to make sure he didn\u2019t do anything reckless. But my phone buzzed again\u2014my boyfriend\u2019s name lighting up the screen. We\u2019d argued every night this week about money, and he wanted to talk, to finally resolve things. I could hear his voice in my head, pleading for my attention, for us to fix what was broken. But my stepbrother was already rolling toward the ramp, and I knew he needed me to watch out for him, to be there in case something went wrong. I felt torn in two, pulled by the weight of both roles\u2014one demanding I stay, the other begging me to go. My hands shook as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to let down."}
