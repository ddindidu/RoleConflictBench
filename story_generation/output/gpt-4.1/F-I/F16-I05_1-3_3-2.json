My partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, gentle but tired: \u201cCan you help with the folding tonight? I\u2019ve had a long day.\u201d I promised I would, and I meant it. But my phone buzzes again\u2014my mentee, anxious and uncertain, needs to talk. She\u2019s facing a career crossroads, and she\u2019s counting on me to help her weigh the options, to offer the kind of thoughtful, structured advice that could shape her future. I know how much this means to her; I remember how lost I felt at her age, desperate for someone to listen. My heart tugs in two directions. I want to be present at home, to share the load and show my partner I care. But I also want to be the mentor I never had, to give my mentee the guidance she deserves. The laundry sits untouched, my phone lights up again, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding more than I have to give."}
