She\u2019d told me, \u201cBe prepared, be on time\u2014respect is everything.\u201d I\u2019d promised myself I would never let her down. But as I gathered my notes, my son tugged at my sleeve, his eyes wide with hope. \u201cMom, are we getting my Nintendo today? You promised.\u201d I remembered the look on his face when I\u2019d said yes, the way he\u2019d counted down the days. I glanced at my bank app, calculating if I could make the purchase before the session, but the store was across town and traffic was heavy. My heart pounded\u2014if I delayed, I\u2019d disrespect my mentor; if I postponed the Nintendo, I\u2019d break my son\u2019s trust. Both roles demanded my presence, my reliability. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, torn between being the mother my son needed and the mentee my mentor expected."}
