He grinned at me, ready to try the new trick he\u2019d been talking about all week. The ramp looked even steeper up close, the concrete chipped and uneven. As his step-sibling, I knew I should look out for him, maybe talk him out of it, or at least make sure he was being safe. But my phone buzzed again\u2014my girlfriend\u2019s name lighting up the screen. Another message, probably about the argument we\u2019d had last night. We\u2019d been fighting all week about money, and she wanted me to call her, to finally talk things through and resolve it. I felt pulled in two directions: if I left to call her, I\u2019d be abandoning my stepbrother when he might need me most. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting my girlfriend down again, risking our relationship. My stomach twisted as I tried to figure out who needed me more right now, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
