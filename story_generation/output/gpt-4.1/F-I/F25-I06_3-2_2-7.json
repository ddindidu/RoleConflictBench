She\u2019d sent, \u201cHow was your day? Did you eat? Call me when you can.\u201d I knew she expected a quick reply, maybe even a call, like we did every evening. It was our routine, a way to keep close since Dad remarried. But today, my mentor had squeezed me into her schedule for a rare fifteen-minute slot. She\u2019d made it clear: \u201cLet\u2019s be efficient\u2014I have back-to-back meetings.\u201d I felt the weight of both expectations pressing on me. If I texted my stepmom now, I\u2019d risk being late or distracted in front of my mentor, who valued focus and respect for her time. But if I ignored my stepmom, she\u2019d worry, maybe even feel hurt, thinking I was pulling away. My thumb hovered over my phone, heart pounding, torn between the two people who counted on me in different ways."}
