I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But then my phone buzzed again\u2014a message from Alex. He\u2019d barely slept since his brother\u2019s accident, and today was the funeral. He needed me, he said. Just to sit with him, to hold his hand, to help him get through the hardest day of his life.\n\nMy heart twisted. I could picture my daughter scanning the crowd, searching for my face, and the disappointment if I wasn\u2019t there. But I could also hear Alex\u2019s voice, raw and broken, asking if I could come.
