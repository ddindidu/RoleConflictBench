My spouse called from the living room, reminding me that her parents would arrive in two hours and the guest room still needed fresh sheets. The pressure to make everything perfect for her family weighed on me\u2014I knew she expected me to share the load, to be present and helpful, especially today. But my phone buzzed again, a string of desperate messages from my boyfriend. Our argument last night had spiraled out of control, and now he was threatening to end things if I didn\u2019t come over and talk. He needed me to listen, to fix what was broken between us, to prove I cared enough to fight for us. I felt torn in two, pulled by the demands of both relationships. My hands shook as I dried the last plate, my mind racing with guilt and anxiety. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, couldn\u2019t meet both of their needs. I stared at my phone, heart pounding, knowing I had to choose\u2014but not yet ready to decide."}
