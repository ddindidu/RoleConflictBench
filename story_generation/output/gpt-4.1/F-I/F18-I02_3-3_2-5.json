My sister\u2019s text was desperate: \u201cCan you come over? I really need you.\u201d She\u2019d just found out about our dad\u2019s diagnosis, and I could hear the panic in her words. I knew she needed me\u2014she always said I was the only one who could calm her down when things got bad. But as I read her message, my girlfriend\u2019s laughter drifted in from the kitchen. She was making coffee, humming, her suitcase already half-packed. This was our last weekend together before she left for her new job overseas. We\u2019d planned every minute\u2014movies, dinner, just being close. She\u2019d been counting on this, and so had I. I felt torn in two, guilt and worry twisting inside me.
