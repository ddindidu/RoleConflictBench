The project was on the critical path, and my inbox was full of messages from my manager, each more urgent than the last. I barely had time to kick off my shoes before I heard the front door slam. My stepbrother trudged in, eyes red, shoulders slumped. He didn\u2019t say anything, just headed straight for the couch and buried his face in a pillow. I knew something was wrong\u2014he always tried to hide it, but I could tell. As his step-sibling, I was supposed to be there for him, to listen and help him through whatever had happened at school. But the clock was ticking, and the client was waiting. My mind raced, torn between sitting beside him, offering comfort, and rushing to my room to finish the work that everyone was counting on. I stood frozen in the hallway, heart pounding, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I was about to let down."}
