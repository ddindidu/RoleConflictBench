She wanted an update on the project, but I\u2019d hit a wall with the new software and didn\u2019t know how to move forward. I knew she expected me to reach out as soon as I ran into trouble, but I kept hesitating, not wanting to seem incapable. As I typed and erased my message for the third time, I noticed my brother drifting ahead, earbuds in, eyes glued to his screen. He stepped off the curb, not even glancing at the traffic. My heart lurched. I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he was safe. But my mentor\u2019s message blinked insistently, reminding me of my responsibility to communicate. I felt torn, caught between shouting for my brother and finally admitting my struggle to my mentor. Both roles demanded my attention at the exact same moment, and I could feel the pressure building, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
