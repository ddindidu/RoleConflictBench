Her eyes were red, and she started talking about how overwhelmed she felt at work, how she didn\u2019t know if she could keep up anymore. She looked at me, searching for comfort, and I could feel the weight of her sadness pressing on me. I wanted to be there for her, to listen and reassure her that things would get better. But just then, I remembered the trash bins outside. Tomorrow was pickup day, and our bin was only half-full. Last week, our neighbor Mrs. Lee had asked if she could use our extra space, since her family always had more trash than would fit in their own bin.
