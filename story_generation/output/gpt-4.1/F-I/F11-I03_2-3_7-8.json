She\u2019d just stormed out after another argument about my boyfriend, insisting I never listened to her concerns. She wanted me to be patient, to understand her point of view, to respect the differences between us. But my phone kept buzzing\u2014my boyfriend, desperate for me to call back. Our fight earlier had been brutal, and now he was questioning if we should even stay together. He needed me to resolve things, to talk it out, to prove that I cared enough to fight for us.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at the wall, torn between the two people I loved most. My sister expected me to be calm, to listen, to show her that our bond mattered. My boyfriend needed me to act, to fix what was broken before it was too late. I felt pulled in opposite directions, the weight of their expectations pressing down on me, unsure which call to answer first."}
