It\u2019s a big deal\u2014my grandparents will be watching, and everyone expects me to honor our traditions perfectly. I know how much this means to them, and I feel the weight of their expectations pressing on me. Just as I\u2019m rehearsing the prayers, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s Maya, an acquaintance from work. She\u2019s moving to a new apartment and asks if I can help her move some boxes on the same day as the ceremony. She sounds desperate\u2014her usual helpers canceled last minute, and she doesn\u2019t know who else to turn to. I can hear the hope in her voice, and I know she\u2019d do the same for me if our roles were reversed. My mind spins with guilt and anxiety. I want to be the dependable daughter my family needs, but I also don\u2019t want to let Maya down when she\u2019s counting on me. The expectations from both sides pull at me, and I feel trapped, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
