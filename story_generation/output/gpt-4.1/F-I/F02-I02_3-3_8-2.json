The home loan repayment loomed over me, just two months away, and I knew I had to find a way to tighten our budget, maybe even take on extra shifts. My mind raced with calculations, plans, and worries about keeping a roof over my family\u2019s head. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mia. She\u2019d lost her brother last week, and every day since, she\u2019d needed me more than ever. She wanted to talk, to cry, to have me by her side. I wanted to be there for her, to hold her hand and listen, but every hour I spent with her was an hour I wasn\u2019t working or planning for the loan. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me. I felt torn, guilty for even thinking about money when Mia was in so much pain, but terrified of failing my family if I didn\u2019t focus on our finances. My heart ached as I stared at the phone, caught between the person who needed my comfort and the family who needed my security."}
