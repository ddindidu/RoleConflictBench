As we reached the busy intersection, I noticed my brother, distracted by his phone, stepping off the curb without checking for cars. My heart raced\u2014I knew I had to protect him, to call out and stop him before something terrible happened. But just as I opened my mouth, Sarah leaned in and whispered, \u201cDid you hear what happened to Emily? I heard she got in trouble for cheating.\u201d She looked at me expectantly, waiting for me to join in. I felt torn. As a sibling, I needed to shout and grab my brother, to keep him safe. But as an acquaintance, I was expected not to gossip or speak ill of others, especially since I knew the truth about Emily\u2019s situation and how easily rumors could hurt her. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, my mind racing between my brother\u2019s safety and the responsibility to not fuel harmful talk. I stood frozen, caught between the urge to protect and the need to do what\u2019s right."}
