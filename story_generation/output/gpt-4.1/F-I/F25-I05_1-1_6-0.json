Just then, my stepdad walked in, his face drawn and tired. I remembered how Mom had seemed distant lately, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check in more. \u201cHey, is everything okay with you and Mom?\u201d I asked, trying to sound casual. He hesitated, then shrugged, \u201cWe\u2019re fine, just a little stressed.\u201d I wanted to press further, to be the supportive step-child they needed, but my phone buzzed again\u2014my mentee, anxious for guidance.
