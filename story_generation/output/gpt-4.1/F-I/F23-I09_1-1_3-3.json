He grumbled but did as I asked, and I felt that familiar tug of pride mixed with the anxiety of being the \u201cnew\u201d parent. Just as I was about to praise him, I glanced out the window and saw Mrs. Patel, our neighbor, struggling with her overflowing trash bag. Trash pickup was tomorrow, and our bin was only half-full. I knew she\u2019d appreciate the extra space, but I\u2019d just told Ethan about respecting boundaries and not using things that aren\u2019t ours without asking. If I offered our bin, I\u2019d be a good neighbor, but would I be undermining the lesson I was trying to teach Ethan? My mind raced, torn between setting a consistent example for Ethan and being the considerate neighbor everyone expects me to be. I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation to honor."}
