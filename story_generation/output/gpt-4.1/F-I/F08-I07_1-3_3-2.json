The family gathering had been planned for weeks\u2014my daughter and her kids were so excited, and I\u2019d promised to bake my famous apple pie. My granddaughter even called last night, asking if I\u2019d braid her hair like I used to. But then, an email popped up: the team meeting was rescheduled to the same afternoon. It wasn\u2019t just any meeting; it was the final discussion before we made decisions that would shape our project for months. My manager expected everyone\u2019s input, and my colleagues counted on me to represent our department\u2019s concerns. I could almost hear the disappointment in my granddaughter\u2019s voice if I missed the gathering, but I also imagined the frustration of my team if I didn\u2019t show up. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, and I felt torn, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
