He didn\u2019t seem overly upset, but I could tell he wanted me to be present, to listen and offer comfort. I reached for his hand, nodding and murmuring encouragement, trying to be the supportive wife he needed. Just then, my phone buzzed with a frantic call from my best friend. Her voice trembled as she explained her car had broken down on the side of the highway, and it was already late. She needed me to come get her right away\u2014she sounded scared and alone. My heart raced as I glanced at my husband, who was still talking, clearly needing my attention. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My friend was in trouble and counting on me, but my husband was here, seeking comfort. I could feel the tension building inside me, unsure which need to answer first."}
