His final exam was tomorrow, and he was on edge, barely eating, barely sleeping. I knew he needed me\u2014someone to listen, to reassure him that he\u2019d be okay. That\u2019s what we promised each other when our parents married: we\u2019d be there, no matter what. But as I walked past the corridor, I saw his textbooks, notes, and even his lucky mug scattered across the floor outside his door. He said the quiet helped him focus, but the HOA had sent out a warning\u2014anything left in the hallway during tomorrow\u2019s inspection would be cited. I was torn. If I moved his things, he\u2019d feel betrayed, like I didn\u2019t care about his stress. If I left them, we\u2019d both get in trouble with the neighbors, and I\u2019d be failing to respect the shared space. My heart pounded as I stood between his door and the corridor, feeling the weight of both promises pressing down on me."}
