He needed me to listen, to reassure him, to help him see the best path forward. I reached for his hand, offering comfort, but my mind wandered to the conversation I\u2019d just left at the caf\u00e9. There, a group of acquaintances had been dissecting the very same workplace decisions my husband was struggling with\u2014decisions made by his colleague, who happened to be a mutual connection. They wanted my opinion, expecting me to join in, but I knew the line between sharing and gossiping was thin. I felt torn, wanting to defend my husband and provide the support he needed, but also aware that anything I said could be twisted or repeated. The weight of their expectant eyes lingered with me, even as I tried to focus on my husband\u2019s needs. My heart pounded with the fear of betraying his trust or alienating myself from the group. I could feel the tension building inside me, unsure which role I could fulfill without letting someone down."}
