The office was quiet, and I finally felt like I could focus. Suddenly, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my younger brother. He\u2019d just gotten home from school and wrote, \u201cCan you talk? Had a rough day.\u201d I could almost hear the heaviness in his words. As his sibling, I knew he counted on me to listen, to be there when things got hard. But as a colleague, I also felt the weight of my responsibility to my team, even if the deadline wasn\u2019t pressing and the others could manage for now. My mind raced, torn between the urge to call my brother and the guilt of leaving my work unfinished. I stared at my phone, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, unsure which role needed me more in this moment."}
