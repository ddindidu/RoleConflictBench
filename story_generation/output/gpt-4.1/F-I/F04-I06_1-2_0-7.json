Can\u2019t wait to celebrate your new job!\u201d I smiled, feeling a warm sense of pride. She\u2019d always been there for me, and tonight was my turn to show up for her, to laugh and share stories over her favorite pasta. But just as I was about to leave, my mentor emailed: \u201cI have 30 minutes free at 7 PM. Let\u2019s discuss your project then\u2014I won\u2019t have time again this week.\u201d My heart sank. I knew how rare it was for her to carve out time, and I owed so much of my progress to her guidance. I stared at my phone, torn. My sister expected me to be present, to celebrate together as family. My mentor expected me to seize this rare opportunity, to show commitment and respect for her time. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt caught between two worlds, each pulling me in a different direction."}
