He\u2019s been struggling for weeks, and lately, he clings to me as his anchor, needing my words and my presence to steady him. I promised I\u2019d be there, always, especially now. But as I made coffee, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mrs. Lee next door. She\u2019s leaving for a week, worried about her deliveries with the power outage coming. She asked if I could keep an eye out, maybe store her packages in our apartment, and check her fridge if the outage lasts. I agreed, of course. We\u2019ve always helped each other out. But now, as my husband calls for me, I feel the weight of both promises. He needs me, all of me, right here. But Mrs. Lee is counting on me too, and I can\u2019t let her down. My heart pounds as I stand between our two doors, torn by the demands of love and neighborly trust, unsure which way to turn."}
