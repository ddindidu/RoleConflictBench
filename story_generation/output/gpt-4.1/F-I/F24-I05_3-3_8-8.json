Instinct screamed at me to grab his arm, to pull him back, to protect him like a good sibling should. But just as I reached out, my phone buzzed with a desperate message from Maya, my mentee. She was about to present her project to the board, her voice trembling with anxiety. She needed my encouragement, my guidance\u2014my belief in her. I was torn, my mind racing between Ethan\u2019s safety and Maya\u2019s future. If I focused on Ethan, I\u2019d let Maya down at her most vulnerable moment. If I answered Maya, I risked Ethan stepping into danger. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be present, reliable, and strong. My hands shook as I hesitated, caught between the urge to protect and the duty to empower, feeling the impossible pull of being both a step-sibling and a mentor at the same time."}
