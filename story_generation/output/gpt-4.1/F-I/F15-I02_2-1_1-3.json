My daughter\u2019s open class was this Thursday afternoon, and she\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play and asking if I\u2019d be there. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But then, just as I was about to confirm with her teacher, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my girlfriend. \u201cHey, we finally have a few free evenings this week! When should we go out?\u201d She\u2019d been patient with my busy schedule, and I knew she was hoping for a special night together, just us, no distractions. Thursday was the only evening she was free, and she sounded so excited. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. My daughter\u2019s hopeful eyes, my girlfriend\u2019s eager smile\u2014both expecting me to be there for them, both on the same day. I wanted to be the parent my daughter could count on, and the boyfriend who made his partner feel cherished. But right now, I could only be in one place, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
