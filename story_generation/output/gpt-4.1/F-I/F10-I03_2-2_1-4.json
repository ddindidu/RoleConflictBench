Every Sunday night, I called my parents, just like I promised. Mom would ask about my week, Dad would tell me about his garden, and I\u2019d feel that familiar warmth of home, even from miles away. But tonight, my boyfriend was waiting in the living room, pizza already ordered, his eyes lighting up when I walked in. We\u2019d barely seen each other all week, and with my work trip starting tomorrow, this was our only chance to really be together. I could hear my mom\u2019s voice in my head, gentle but expectant, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to call, sweetheart.\u201d At the same time, I felt the weight of my boyfriend\u2019s hope for a relaxed, uninterrupted evening. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the comfort of family tradition and the closeness of the person I loved. I sat on the edge of the bed, phone in hand, torn between dialing home and walking out to him, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
