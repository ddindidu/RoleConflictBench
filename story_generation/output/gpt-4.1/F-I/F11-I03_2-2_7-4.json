My younger brother had just messaged, \u201cCan we talk tonight? I really need you.\u201d He\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be more patient, more understanding\u2014he deserved a sister who listened, who respected his feelings even when we disagreed. But then there was Alex, my boyfriend, who\u2019d been looking forward to tonight all week. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you,\u201d he\u2019d written, a little heart at the end. With both our schedules packed, this was our only chance to spend time together before I left for my work trip. I could almost hear his disappointment if I canceled. My chest tightened as I weighed their needs against each other\u2014my brother\u2019s vulnerability, Alex\u2019s longing for connection. I wanted to be there for both, to build trust and closeness, but the clock was ticking, and I knew I couldn\u2019t split myself in two."}
