My daughter\u2019s open class was about to start, and she\u2019d been talking about it for days, her eyes shining with excitement every time she reminded me. I promised her I\u2019d be there, sitting in the front row, watching her read aloud. But as I gathered my things to leave, my phone buzzed again\u2014another email from my team. They were waiting for my input on a project detail, and without my clarification, the whole task was stalled. I could almost hear the impatience in their messages, the unspoken expectation that I\u2019d respond quickly, as I usually did. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment in my daughter\u2019s face against the frustration of my colleagues. I stood in the hallway, torn, my mind racing with the impossible choice between being the parent my child needed and the reliable colleague my team depended on."}
