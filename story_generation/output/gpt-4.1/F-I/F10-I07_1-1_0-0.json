Everything okay?\u201d I glance at the clock\u20143:55 p.m. The weekly team meeting starts in five minutes. I know the meeting will be recorded, but my manager always appreciates when everyone joins live and contributes. Still, I can almost hear my mom\u2019s voice, tinged with worry, hoping for a quick call or at least a thoughtful reply. I type out a hasty \u201cAll good, just busy!\u201d but hesitate before sending it. It feels too brief, almost dismissive. At the same time, my laptop pings with a calendar reminder. I picture my teammates\u2019 faces in the little video boxes, waiting for updates, expecting me to be present and engaged. My heart pounds as I sit at the crossroads\u2014do I call my mom and risk missing the meeting, or do I join the meeting and leave my mom waiting, her concern growing? The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
