My daughter had reminded me twice about the family gathering\u2014my grandkids were excited, and I knew how much these moments meant to them. I wanted to be present, to laugh and share stories, to be the grandfather they looked forward to seeing. But as I was about to leave, I ran into Mark, an acquaintance from the neighborhood, outside the caf\u00e9. He started talking about a mutual colleague, his tone turning sharp as he criticized her recent project. I felt uncomfortable; I\u2019ve always believed in not speaking ill of others, especially when they\u2019re not around to defend themselves. Yet Mark seemed to expect me to join in, nodding as if waiting for my agreement. My phone buzzed with a reminder about the family gathering. I stood there, torn\u2014should I politely excuse myself and risk seeming rude, or stay and risk being drawn into gossip, betraying my own values? The expectations of being a good grandfather and a respectful acquaintance pulled at me from both sides, and I could feel the tension rising inside."}
