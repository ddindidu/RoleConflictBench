He was upset about our weekend plans\u2014apparently, I\u2019d forgotten to confirm, and now he felt ignored. He wanted to talk, to clear the air, to resolve things before they festered. At the same time, I glanced up at my husband, who sat across from me, unusually quiet, his brow furrowed. I knew he expected me to ask, to open up the conversation, to share what was on my mind and invite him to do the same. That\u2019s how we\u2019d always handled things\u2014by talking, by being honest. But my mind was split. If I focused on my husband, Alex would feel dismissed, the misunderstanding growing. If I texted Alex back, my husband would see me distracted, maybe even uncaring, just when he needed me most. My heart pounded as I tried to decide whose needs to meet first, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
