He always wanted to know how my day went, what I ate, if I\u2019d finished my homework. He said it made him feel included, and I knew how much it meant to him, especially since I\u2019d only moved in a few months ago. Just as I was about to hit send, I heard a knock at the door. It was Mrs. Lee from next door, holding a bag of trash. \u201cWould you mind if I put this in your bin? Ours is overflowing,\u201d she asked, glancing at the half-empty bin by the curb. I remembered the building rules: we\u2019re supposed to keep our own trash separate, but Mrs. Lee had always been kind to me. My phone buzzed again\u2014my stepdad, asking if everything was okay since I hadn\u2019t replied yet. I felt torn, caught between being the attentive step-child my dad wanted and the considerate neighbor Mrs. Lee needed. My heart pounded as I stood there, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
