Our argument from last night still hung in the air, unresolved and raw. I knew she expected me to reach out, to smooth things over, to show that I cared enough to fight for us. But just as I was about to type a reply, my grandson wandered in, his face clouded with uncertainty. He hesitated, then asked, \u201cGrandma, how do you know when you\u2019re ready for something new?\u201d I saw the hope in his eyes, the trust that I\u2019d have some wisdom to share. My heart twisted\u2014he needed my full attention, my guidance, the calm assurance that comes from years of living. Yet my mind kept drifting back to my phone, to the urgent need to fix things with my partner before the rift grew wider. I felt torn, pulled in two directions by the people I loved, each expecting something only I could give. My hands trembled as I tried to focus on my grandson, but the weight of my other life pressed in, demanding to be answered."}
