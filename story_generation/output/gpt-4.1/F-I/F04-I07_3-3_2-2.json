It was a message from my sister: \u201cCan you call me? I really need you right now.\u201d She never asked for help unless it was serious. My heart tightened. As her brother, I\u2019d always promised to be there, especially when things got tough. But today, my team was counting on me too. The meeting was about to start\u2014the last chance to voice concerns before our project\u2019s direction was set in stone. My manager had made it clear: everyone\u2019s input was crucial. I could see my teammates gathering, waiting for me to join. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down. My sister\u2019s words echoed in my mind, but so did the expectation that I\u2019d be a reliable colleague. I stood frozen in the hallway, phone in hand, caught between the urge to support my family and the responsibility to my team."}
