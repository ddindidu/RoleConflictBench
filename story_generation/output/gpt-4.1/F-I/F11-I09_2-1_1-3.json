It was my younger brother, his voice shaky as he asked if I could come over\u2014he\u2019d had a rough day and just needed someone to talk to. As his sister, I knew how much he relied on me in moments like this. I promised I\u2019d be there soon. \n\nBut as I stepped outside, I noticed the trash bins lined up along the curb. Tomorrow was pickup day, and our shared bin with the neighbors was only half-full. I remembered Mrs. Lee next door had asked me to be mindful not to overfill it, since she\u2019d had extra bags this week. I hesitated, holding my own bag of trash. If I left it, my apartment would smell, but if I squeezed it in, I might crowd out my neighbor\u2019s space. \n\nI stood there, torn between being the supportive sister my brother needed and the considerate neighbor I promised to be. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which role to honor first."}
