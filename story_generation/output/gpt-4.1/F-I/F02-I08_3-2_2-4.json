My heart sank\u2014he\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me today. As a father, I knew I had to be there, to show my son that his actions mattered and that I cared enough to help him make things right. I could already picture his anxious face, waiting for me to walk through the school doors.\n\nJust as I was about to call the school, my phone buzzed again. It was Mark, an old acquaintance. \u201cHey, sorry for the last-minute ask, but could you help me move some boxes this afternoon? I\u2019m really in a bind.\u201d I remembered how he\u2019d helped me out once, and I felt the weight of obligation settle on my shoulders. He didn\u2019t have anyone else to call.\n\nI felt torn, pulled between my son\u2019s need for guidance and Mark\u2019s plea for help. Both expected me to show up, to be reliable. My mind raced, guilt and worry twisting together as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once."}
