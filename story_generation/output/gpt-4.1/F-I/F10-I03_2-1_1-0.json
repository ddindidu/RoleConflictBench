I could already picture my mom waiting by the phone, eager to hear about my week, and my dad ready with his usual questions about my job and health. I knew how much these calls meant to them, especially since I moved out. But as I reached for my phone, I glanced at Alex, my boyfriend, slumped on the couch. He looked tired, his eyes distant, and I could sense the weight of his day pressing on him. He hadn\u2019t said much since coming home, and I knew he needed me to be present, to listen and reassure him. My parents expected me to check in, to be the caring daughter they raised. Alex needed me to be the supportive girlfriend he could lean on. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, guilt creeping in no matter which way I turned. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, caught between the comfort of my parents\u2019 voices and the silent plea in Alex\u2019s eyes, unsure which need to answer first."}
