My wife\u2019s voice echoed from the other room, reminding me that the rent was due next week and groceries were running low. As a father, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down on me\u2014my family depended on me to keep us afloat, to make sure there was food on the table and a roof over our heads. Just as I was about to dive into the budget again, my phone buzzed. It was a message from one of my mentees, a bright young woman at work who often turned to me for advice. She was facing a crossroads in her career and wanted to talk, hoping I could help her make sense of her options. I knew she valued my guidance, and I prided myself on being there for those who needed direction. But as I stared at the phone, I felt torn. My family needed my focus and energy, but so did she. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which role to answer first."}
