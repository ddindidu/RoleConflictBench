The store manager\u2019s stern gaze bore into me, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as a mother\u2014this was the moment to teach him right from wrong, to show him that actions have consequences. My heart pounded, but before I could speak, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Alex: \u201cCan you come? I need you.\u201d His father had passed away just hours ago, and he was alone, devastated, needing comfort only I could give. I looked at my son\u2019s guilty face, then at my phone, torn between staying to guide my child through this lesson and rushing to hold Alex as he grieved. Both needed me, both expected me to be strong, present, and understanding. My chest tightened as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and the pressure of choosing between being a good mother and a supportive girlfriend pressed down on me, leaving me paralyzed in the fluorescent-lit aisle."}
