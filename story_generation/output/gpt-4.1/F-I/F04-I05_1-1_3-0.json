My parents chimed in, eager for us all to spend time together, and I felt the familiar warmth of belonging. Just as I was about to agree, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from one of my mentees, anxious about an upcoming internship interview and asking if I could review her resume and do a mock interview on Saturday. I knew how much she relied on my guidance, and I\u2019d promised to help her whenever she needed it. My family looked at me expectantly, waiting for my answer about the trip, while my mind raced with the responsibility I felt toward my mentee. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the desire to be present as a brother, sharing laughter and memories, and the commitment to be a reliable mentor, offering support when it mattered most. I felt torn, caught between the pull of family togetherness and the duty to guide someone who counted on me."}
