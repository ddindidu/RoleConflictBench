My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from my spouse, reminding me that the house still needed vacuuming and the guest room sheets hadn\u2019t been changed. Relatives were arriving tomorrow, and everything had to be spotless. I could almost hear the expectation in their voice: we\u2019re a team, and I can\u2019t do this alone.\n\nBut at work, the pressure was mounting. The project manager had just sent a reminder that my part of the task was on the critical path for a client delivery. If I missed the deadline, the whole team would be held up, and the client would be furious. My colleagues were counting on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, my mind racing with lists\u2014cleaning supplies and client requirements, dusting schedules and data analysis. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how to be the reliable partner at home and the dependable colleague at work, knowing that something, or someone, would have to wait."}
