We request your presence at a meeting tomorrow morning.\u201d My mind raced with worry and guilt\u2014how could I not have seen this coming? I knew I had to be there for my child, to listen, to guide, to show the school I was a responsible parent. But as I closed the email, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the project my mentor assigned was due before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation with upper management. I hadn\u2019t finished it yet. My mentor had been clear\u2014this was a chance to prove myself, to show I was ready for more responsibility. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My child needed me, but so did my career. I sat at my desk, torn between the urgent call to parenthood and the equally pressing demands of my professional growth, anxiety twisting in my chest as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be enough for both."}
