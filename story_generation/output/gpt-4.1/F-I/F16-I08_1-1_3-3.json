We agreed to share household chores, and lately, I\u2019ve been letting things slide. The guilt gnaws at me as I remember the promise I made to help more, especially with folding clothes. Just as I reach for a shirt, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s an old acquaintance from college, someone I haven\u2019t seen in years, asking for a quick favor\u2014could I recommend a good restaurant nearby for their anniversary dinner tonight? I know they\u2019re counting on me, and I want to be helpful, but my partner\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, reminding me that the laundry won\u2019t fold itself. I feel torn, caught between the urge to be a supportive spouse and the desire to be a reliable friend. My hands hover over the laundry, my phone screen glowing with the waiting message, and I can feel the tension building inside me as I try to decide which expectation to meet first."}
