She\u2019d just been rejected from her dream job and needed someone to talk to. As her brother, I wanted nothing more than to comfort her, to listen and reassure her that things would get better. But as her mentor, I knew she was at a crossroads\u2014she had another offer on the table, one that could shape her entire career. She needed clear, objective advice, not just a shoulder to cry on. I could hear the expectation in her voice: she wanted her brother\u2019s warmth, but also her mentor\u2019s wisdom. My heart ached as I tried to balance the urge to simply be there for her with the responsibility to guide her through this pivotal moment. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding something different, and I found myself caught in the tension, unsure which part of me she needed most."}
