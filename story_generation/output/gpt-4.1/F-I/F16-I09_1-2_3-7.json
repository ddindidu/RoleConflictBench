We\u2019ve both been busy, and the pile has grown embarrassingly high. I know it\u2019s my turn\u2014last time, my partner did it without complaint, and I promised I\u2019d handle it next. But as I reach for the first towel, my phone buzzes with a weather alert: a severe storm is expected tonight. My thoughts immediately turn to Mrs. Kim, our elderly neighbor who lives alone just down the hall. She always asks me to check in on her during bad weather, and I know she\u2019ll be anxious tonight. I feel torn\u2014my partner is counting on me to finally tackle the laundry, but Mrs. Kim might need reassurance or help securing her windows. I can almost hear my spouse\u2019s tired sigh if I leave the laundry untouched again, but I also imagine Mrs. Kim waiting nervously for someone to knock. My heart pounds as I stand between the laundry and the door, pulled by two promises I don\u2019t want to break."}
