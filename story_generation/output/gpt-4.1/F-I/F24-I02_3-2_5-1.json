My stepmom had sent a long text about how important it was for all of us to be there, especially since it was the first time we\u2019d all be together since Dad remarried. I knew how much it meant to her, and to my dad, for me to show up and be part of the family, to help make things feel normal and united.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from Mia. She\u2019d just gotten home, her words shaky and short. She\u2019d been passed over for a promotion she\u2019d worked so hard for, and I could hear the tears in her voice when I called. She needed me, needed someone to listen, to hold her, to remind her she was more than her job.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. I wanted to be the supportive boyfriend Mia deserved, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my new family down. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once."}
