She looked at me with those searching eyes, hoping for the kind of wisdom only a grandmother could offer. I wanted to give her my full attention, to share stories of my own beginnings and reassure her that she would find her way. But just as she began to open up, my dog started barking loudly in the hallway\u2014again. I knew Mrs. Patel next door was sensitive to noise, especially early in the day, and she\u2019d already mentioned the barking last week. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions: the urge to comfort my granddaughter and the responsibility to be a considerate neighbor. I could see my granddaughter\u2019s face fall as the barking grew louder, and I could almost hear Mrs. Patel\u2019s sigh through the wall. My mind raced, caught between the wisdom I wanted to share and the boundaries I needed to respect, unsure which role to answer first."}
