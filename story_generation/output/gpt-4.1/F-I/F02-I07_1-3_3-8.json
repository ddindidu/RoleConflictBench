He was supposed to be learning table manners, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be patient and consistent, guiding him through these small but important lessons. \u201cRemember, we keep our elbows off the table,\u201d I reminded gently, trying to sound encouraging rather than frustrated. Just then, my phone buzzed insistently. A message from my manager flashed on the screen: \u201cNeed your confirmation ASAP for the partner meeting\u2014waiting on you.\u201d I knew the team was counting on me to respond quickly; any delay could hold up the whole process. My son looked up, waiting for my next word, while my phone vibrated again, the pressure mounting. I felt torn, my attention pulled in two directions\u2014one demanding I be present and nurturing, the other expecting me to be responsive and reliable. My heart pounded as I wrestled with which role to honor in that moment, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
