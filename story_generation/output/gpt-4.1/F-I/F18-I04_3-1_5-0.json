My little sister was already dressed, excitedly talking about the games we\u2019d play after dinner. I knew how much these family gatherings meant to everyone, especially since we didn\u2019t get together often. Just as I was about to head upstairs to change, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my friend, Sam: \u201cHey, can you talk? I\u2019ve had the worst day. Everything just feels pointless right now.\u201d I stared at the screen, feeling a knot tighten in my stomach. Sam rarely reached out like this, and I knew he needed someone to listen. But I could already hear my mom calling my name, asking if I was getting ready. I felt torn\u2014my family expected me to be present and cheerful, but Sam was counting on me to be there for him. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I didn\u2019t know how I could possibly be what everyone needed at the same time."}
