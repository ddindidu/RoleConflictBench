Guilt pricked at me as I typed a quick message, asking how they were and promising to call soon. I knew they worried if I went silent, and I wanted to reassure them, even if it was just a few words. As I hit send, I walked down the nearly empty hallway of my apartment building. Just then, I spotted Mark, an acquaintance from down the hall, coming toward me. He looked up, expecting a smile or a friendly greeting. My phone buzzed in my hand\u2014my mom\u2019s reply, probably wanting to chat. I felt torn. If I stopped to text my parents, I\u2019d seem rude to Mark, but if I focused on being friendly to Mark, I\u2019d delay the communication my parents expected. My mind raced, caught between the warmth of home and the social ease of the hallway, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
