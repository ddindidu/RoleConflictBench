My stepmother caught my eye and smiled, expecting me to join in, to help set the table and recite the family blessing\u2014something I still felt awkward doing, but I knew it mattered to her. Just as I stood up, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Jamie, someone I\u2019d only recently met at work. She was outside, crying, needing someone to talk to after a rough day. I could see her through the window, shoulders shaking, and I knew she didn\u2019t have anyone else nearby. I felt torn\u2014my stepmother\u2019s hopeful glance, the warmth of the family tradition I was supposed to embrace, and Jamie\u2019s desperate need for a friendly face. My heart pounded as I stood between the two worlds, feeling the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which part of myself I was supposed to honor."}
