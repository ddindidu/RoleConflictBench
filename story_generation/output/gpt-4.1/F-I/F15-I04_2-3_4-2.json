I knew I had to step in, to teach him about respect and discipline, to show him that running wild in public wasn\u2019t acceptable. I took a deep breath, ready to call him over, when my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was my best friend, calling in the middle of the night, her name lighting up the screen. I answered, and immediately heard her sobbing\u2014she could barely get the words out, but I understood enough: something terrible had happened in her family, and she needed me to listen, to be there for her, to offer comfort and support. My son\u2019s laughter echoed down the aisle, drawing annoyed glances. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014one part desperate to be the parent my child needed in that moment, the other aching to be the friend my friend needed, right now. I stood there, phone pressed to my ear, my son\u2019s voice and my friend\u2019s tears swirling around me, not knowing which role to answer first."}
