She\u2019d just snapped at her younger brother, and I knew I should address it\u2014remind her about kindness and respect, reinforce the values I promised myself I\u2019d uphold as her step-parent. But my phone buzzed again: a message from my mentee, desperate for last-minute advice before her big interview tomorrow. She was counting on me to help her shine, to be the mentor who believed in her potential and pushed her to grow. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in. If I focused on my stepdaughter now, I\u2019d let my mentee down in her moment of need. If I answered my mentee, I\u2019d miss a crucial teaching moment at home.
