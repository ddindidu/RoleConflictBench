I glanced at the screen\u2014my best friend\u2019s name flashed, and I could hear her sobbing before I even answered. She could barely speak, her words tumbling out between gasps: her family had just received terrible news, and she needed someone to talk to. I sat up, heart pounding, wanting nothing more than to be there for her, to listen and comfort her like I always had. But as I reached for my bedroom door, I remembered my parents\u2019 recent reminders about our family\u2019s traditions\u2014no phone calls or visitors after ten, respect for quiet hours, and the importance of being present for morning prayers. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, gentle but firm, reminding me that upholding our customs showed respect for our family and ancestors. My friend\u2019s voice trembled through the phone, desperate for support, while the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressed down on me. I stood in the dark, torn between the person my family wanted me to be and the friend I promised I would always be."}
