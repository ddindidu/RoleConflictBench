It\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart tightened. I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and as a grandfather, I felt the weight of being the steady anchor, the one who checks in, listens, and reassures. But just as I reached for the phone, my mentee knocked on the door, her face pale. \u201cI need your help,\u201d she said, voice trembling. The project she was leading was at a critical juncture, and any misstep could set the team back weeks. She looked to me for guidance, for the wisdom I\u2019d promised to share. I glanced at the phone, then at her, feeling the pull from both sides\u2014my family needing my presence, my mentee needing my expertise. The expectations pressed in, each demanding my full attention, and I felt myself caught in the middle, torn by the impossible choice between being the grandfather my family needed and the mentor my mentee depended on."}
