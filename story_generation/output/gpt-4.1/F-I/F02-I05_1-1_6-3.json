My son\u2019s text glowed on the screen: \u201cDad, is today the day we get the Nintendo?\u201d I\u2019d promised him weeks ago, but the bills on my desk told a different story. As a father, I wanted to see his face light up, to keep my word and give him something special. But the numbers didn\u2019t add up, and I worried about making rent.\n\nJust then, my mentee poked his head in, a hopeful look on his face. \u201cGot a minute? I\u2019m stuck on that project you mentioned.\u201d As his mentor, I knew how much he relied on my guidance, and I prided myself on being available, sharing what I\u2019d learned. But my mind was split\u2014half with my son, half with my mentee, both expecting something from me. I felt the weight of their hopes, the pull of my responsibilities, and the ache of not knowing how to be enough for both."}
