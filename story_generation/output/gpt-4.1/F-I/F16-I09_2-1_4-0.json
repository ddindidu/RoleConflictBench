The kids had soccer practice tomorrow, and everyone needed clean uniforms. As I fumbled with my keys, I spotted Mrs. Lee, my neighbor, coming down the corridor. She smiled warmly, clearly expecting a friendly chat. I knew she valued these small exchanges; it was part of being a good neighbor, and I didn\u2019t want to seem rude or distant. But the clock was ticking, and I could almost hear my spouse\u2019s voice reminding me about the laundry. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: a quick, polite conversation to maintain neighborly goodwill, or a dash inside to start the wash and keep my promise at home. I stood there, caught between the laundry room and the corridor, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me."}
