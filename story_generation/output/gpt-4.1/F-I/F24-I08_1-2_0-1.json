He looked up at me, eyes pleading for reassurance, and I knew he needed me to be there, to listen, to remind him he was capable. That\u2019s what we promised each other after our parents married\u2014no matter what, we\u2019d have each other\u2019s backs. But my phone buzzed with a message from a friend: \u201cHey, can you come over? There\u2019s someone new here and they\u2019re super shy. You\u2019re always good at making people feel welcome.\u201d I glanced at my stepbrother, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I wanted to be the supportive sibling he needed, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my friend down or leave a stranger feeling isolated. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be both things at once, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left wanting more from me."}
