My son\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, asking if we could go to the store for groceries. I glanced at the bank app on my phone\u2014our balance was lower than I\u2019d hoped. I needed to pick up extra shifts this week, just to make sure we\u2019d have enough for rent and food. At the same time, a new message popped up from a colleague. \u201cNo rush, just wanted to keep you in the loop,\u201d it read, but I knew the unspoken rule: respond quickly, show you\u2019re engaged, be a team player. My mind raced. If I didn\u2019t reply soon, would I seem unreliable? But if I left now, I could get groceries before the store closed, and my son wouldn\u2019t go to bed hungry. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. I stared at the screen, torn, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, heart pounding as I tried to decide which role to answer first."}
