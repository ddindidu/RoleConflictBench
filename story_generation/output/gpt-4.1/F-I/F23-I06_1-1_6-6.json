But as I glanced at the kitchen table, I saw the crumpled flyer for the Nintendo my stepson had been eyeing for months. I\u2019d promised him, after all\u2014if I could manage the extra shift, if the bills weren\u2019t too high, if I could just make it work. He\u2019d been counting down the days, his excitement growing with every mention. \n\nBut the numbers in my bank account didn\u2019t lie, and I knew that taking time off for my mentor\u2019s office hours meant losing out on overtime pay.
