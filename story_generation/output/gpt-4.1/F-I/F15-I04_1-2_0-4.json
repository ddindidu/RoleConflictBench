They always looked for me, their faces lighting up when they spotted me in the crowd. As I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed. It was Sam, my oldest friend, his voice shaky. \u201cI think I left my passport at home. I\u2019m almost at the airport. Can you check and bring it if it\u2019s there? My flight\u2019s in two hours. Please, I\u2019m freaking out.\u201d\n\nMy heart pounded. I could hear the panic in Sam\u2019s voice, and I knew how much this trip meant to him. But my kids\u2014what would they think if I wasn\u2019t there? Would they worry, feel forgotten? I stood frozen in the hallway, keys in one hand, phone in the other, torn between the two people who needed me most at that moment. The weight of their expectations pressed down on me, and I felt the sting of knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
