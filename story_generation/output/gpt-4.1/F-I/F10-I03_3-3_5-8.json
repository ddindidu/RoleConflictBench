My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was for me to lead the family ceremony this year, just as my grandmother had done. She said it was my duty to honor our traditions, to show respect for our heritage. At the same time, my boyfriend\u2019s texts grew more desperate. Our argument from last night still hung in the air, unresolved and raw. He wanted to talk, to fix things before they fell apart completely. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my family expecting me to be the perfect daughter, the keeper of our customs, while my boyfriend needed me to be present, to fight for us. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The pressure built inside me, torn between loyalty to my family and the love I was afraid of losing."}
