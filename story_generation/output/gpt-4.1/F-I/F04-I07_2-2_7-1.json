I really need you.\u201d He\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be more patient, more present, to build the kind of mutual respect we\u2019d both wanted growing up. But as I typed out a reply, a calendar alert popped up\u2014team meeting in fifteen minutes. This wasn\u2019t just any meeting; it was the one where the project leads would share updates that wouldn\u2019t be sent out later. My manager had made it clear: everyone\u2019s participation was expected, no exceptions. I could already imagine the disappointment in my brother\u2019s voice if I told him to wait, but I also pictured the frustration on my team\u2019s faces if I missed out and had to ask for a recap. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the pull of being a good brother and a reliable colleague, and not knowing which role I\u2019d have to let down tonight."}
