He\u2019s been offered a promotion, but it means relocating, and he\u2019s torn. He looks at me, searching for reassurance, for the kind of unwavering support I\u2019ve always tried to give. I want to sit beside him, hold his hand, and help him sort through his worries. But my phone buzzes\u2014a message from Mrs. Lee, our elderly neighbor. She\u2019s worried about the storm and asks if I could check in on her later, maybe help secure her balcony plants. I know she has no one else nearby, and I promised her family I\u2019d look out for her. My husband\u2019s eyes plead for my attention, but Mrs. Lee\u2019s vulnerability tugs at me too. I feel split, the weight of both their needs pressing on my chest, unsure how to be present for both when the storm, both literal and emotional, is closing in."}
