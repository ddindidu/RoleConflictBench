My mom\u2019s voice echoed from downstairs, reminding me that tonight was our family\u2019s annual holiday dinner\u2014a tradition I\u2019d never missed. I could already picture the table set with my grandmother\u2019s dishes, the laughter, the stories. It was important to them, and to me, to be there, to show I valued our family\u2019s rituals.\n\nBut my phone screen glowed with a new message from Alex. We\u2019d just had a misunderstanding about our weekend plans, and I could sense her frustration. She wanted to talk, to clear the air before things festered. I knew how much it meant to her that we didn\u2019t let small issues grow, that we faced things head-on. She expected me to be present, to prioritize our relationship and resolve things quickly.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the urgency in Alex\u2019s words. I wanted to be the daughter who honored tradition, and the girlfriend who didn\u2019t let problems linger. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, unable to choose without letting someone down."}
