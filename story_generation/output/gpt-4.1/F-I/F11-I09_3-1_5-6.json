My parents have been reminding me all week how important it is for everyone to be there, and my little brother keeps texting, asking if I\u2019ll help him set up the decorations. I know how much it means to them, and I want to be present, laughing and sharing stories like we always do. But just as I\u2019m about to leave, Mrs. Lee from next door knocks, looking worried. She tells me she\u2019s expecting an important package today, and since she has to work late, she asks if I can keep an eye out and sign for it. She\u2019s always been a kind neighbor, watering my plants when I\u2019m away and checking in during storms.

The weight of both responsibilities presses on me, and I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, heart racing, unsure which door to walk through first."}
