Just behind them, I noticed Jake, a guy from my chemistry class who I only knew in passing. Sam caught my eye and gave me a hopeful look, the kind that said he wanted me to acknowledge him, maybe even invite him to join me and my friends for lunch later. We\u2019d talked about including each other more, building that mutual respect Mom always encouraged.\n\nBut then Jake nodded at me, expecting the usual friendly smile and small talk we exchanged whenever we crossed paths. I felt the pressure to keep things light and approachable with him, not wanting to seem standoffish or rude. At the same time, I knew Sam was watching, waiting to see if I\u2019d treat him like just another kid in the hallway or as my brother, someone I respected enough to include. My mind raced, torn between the easy friendliness expected with Jake and the deeper, more meaningful connection I was supposed to nurture with Sam. I hesitated, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet."}
