The kids can\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d I smiled, picturing my grandchildren\u2019s faces, but my mind was already racing. That same afternoon, one of my mentees, Sarah, had called, her voice trembling. She\u2019d been offered a job in another city and wanted to talk it through\u2014she needed guidance, and she needed it soon. I\u2019d always prided myself on being there for my family, especially during the holidays, but I also knew how much Sarah relied on my advice. The family expected me to be present, to share stories and laughter, to keep our traditions alive. Sarah expected me to help her make a decision that could change her life. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each pulling me in a different direction. My heart ached at the thought of letting anyone down, and I sat in silence, torn between the warmth of family and the responsibility of mentorship, unsure which path to take."}
