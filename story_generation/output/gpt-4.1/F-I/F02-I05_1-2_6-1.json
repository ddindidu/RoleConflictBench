He\u2019d done well in school, and I wanted to reward him, but the price tag gnawed at me. Money was tight this month, and I knew every dollar counted toward groceries and bills. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my mentee at work, asking if I could review her project draft before tomorrow\u2019s deadline. She was struggling, and I\u2019d promised to be there for her, to guide her through these tough moments. I felt the weight of both promises\u2014my son\u2019s excitement and trust, my mentee\u2019s reliance on my support. I wanted to be the father who kept his word, the mentor who never let anyone down. But time and money were both in short supply, and I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between the needs of my family and the responsibilities I\u2019d taken on at work."}
