She needed my guidance\u2014she was at a crossroads, and my advice could shape her entire career. I\u2019d promised her a thorough review of her options, and she was counting on me to help her make the right choice. But across the table, my younger brother, Alex, was watching me with hopeful eyes. He\u2019d invited me to join him and his friends for a rare night out, something he\u2019d been asking for weeks. He wanted us to be more than just siblings\u2014he wanted us to be friends, to share experiences and build the kind of mutual respect that comes from being present in each other\u2019s lives. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the responsibility to guide Sarah with care, and the desire to show Alex that he mattered. My heart tugged in two directions, each expectation pulling me away from the other, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which role to honor first."}
