My heart pounded with the weight of what I needed to do as a father\u2014teach him right from wrong, show him that actions have consequences, and somehow guide him through this mistake with love and firmness. I was just about to speak when my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. It was a message from Mark, my oldest friend: \u201cCar broke down on the highway. It\u2019s freezing. Please, can you come get me? No one else is picking up.\u201d I stared at the screen, torn. Mark had always been there for me, and I knew he was counting on me now. But my son needed me, right here, right now, to be the father he deserved. The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore. My mind raced, caught between the desperate plea of my friend and the silent, trembling need of my child."}
