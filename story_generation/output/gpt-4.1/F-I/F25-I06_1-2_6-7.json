My stepdad had just texted, \u201cRough day. Can we talk?\u201d I knew he\u2019d been struggling lately, and Mom always said I was the one who could get through to him. I wanted to be there, to ask if he was okay, to listen like I always did. But at the same time, my mentor\u2019s email notification popped up: \u201cCan you meet in 10 minutes? I only have a short window today.\u201d She was always so busy, and I\u2019d been waiting weeks for this chance to ask her about my project. I felt torn\u2014my family needed me, but so did my future. If I ignored my stepdad, I\u2019d feel guilty for not being the support he counted on. If I missed my mentor, I might not get another chance soon, and I didn\u2019t want to seem ungrateful or unreliable. My hands shook as I stared at both messages, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
