He\u2019d snapped at me for not helping him with his homework, and I\u2019d lost my patience, raising my voice. I knew I should have been more understanding\u2014he\u2019s always struggled with math, and I promised myself I\u2019d be a better brother, someone he could trust and respect. But my mind kept drifting back to the group project for my internship. My teammates were at each other\u2019s throats, and the deadline was looming. My mentor had always told me to communicate any issues right away, to never let problems fester. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides: my brother needed me to be calm and supportive, while my mentor expected honesty and initiative. I stared at the phone, torn between calling my mentor to explain the chaos or going to my brother\u2019s room to apologize. My chest tightened as I realized I couldn\u2019t be both the patient brother and the proactive mentee at the same time."}
