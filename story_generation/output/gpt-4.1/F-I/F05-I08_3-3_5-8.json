My cousins will be here in two hours, and everything has to be perfect.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation. I wanted to be the supportive husband, to share the load and make her proud of our home. Just as I reached for the vacuum, my phone buzzed. It was Mark, an old acquaintance, his message urgent: \u201cCall me. It\u2019s about Sarah.\u201d \n\nWhen I called, Mark\u2019s voice was low. He shared a rumor about Sarah, someone we both knew. He seemed eager for me to react, maybe even to pass it on. But I remembered my own values\u2014never to gossip or harm someone\u2019s reputation. Yet, the pressure from Mark was real, and I could sense he expected me to join in. Meanwhile, my wife\u2019s voice echoed from the hallway, reminding me of the chores still undone. I stood there, torn between being the helpful husband she needed and the principled acquaintance I wanted to be, feeling the tension knotting in my chest."}
