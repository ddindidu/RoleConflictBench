My wife was in the living room, vacuuming furiously, her voice echoing, \u201cCan you help me with the guest room next?\u201d Relatives would arrive in a few hours, and every surface needed to shine. I knew she was counting on me to pull my weight, to make sure we presented a united, organized front. But my phone kept lighting up\u2014messages from my team at work, waiting for my input on a project that couldn\u2019t move forward without my clarification. The expectation was clear: I needed to respond quickly, keep the workflow smooth, not let anyone down. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the urgency of home and the demands of work. My mind raced, guilt tugging from both directions. I wanted to be a reliable partner, but I also didn\u2019t want to be the bottleneck at work. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught in the middle, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
