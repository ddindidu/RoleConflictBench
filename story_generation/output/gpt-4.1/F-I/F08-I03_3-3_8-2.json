First, a message from my daughter: \u201cMom, can you call? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I could sense the panic in her words, and my heart clenched, knowing something serious must have happened. As a grandmother, I\u2019ve always prided myself on being the steady anchor, the one everyone turns to in a storm. I knew I needed to call her, to be there for my family, to listen and offer comfort.\n\nBut before I could dial, my partner\u2019s voice broke through the silence, trembling and raw. He\u2019d just lost his brother, and the grief in his eyes was almost unbearable. He needed me\u2014right now\u2014to hold him, to let him cry, to be the safe place he could fall apart. I felt torn in two, my chest tight with guilt and worry. My family expected me to be present, to help them through their crisis, but my partner needed me just as desperately. I stood frozen, phone in hand, heart pulled in opposite directions, unsure which need to answer first."}
