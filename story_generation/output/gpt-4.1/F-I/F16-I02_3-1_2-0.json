My spouse was in the living room, her eyes red from crying, her voice trembling as she tried to explain how everything felt like it was falling apart. She needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words to anchor her, my presence to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. I could hear her soft sobs through the door, and my heart ached with the weight of her pain.\n\nAt the same time, my phone lit up with a message from my girlfriend. She\u2019d had a rough day at work, nothing catastrophic, but she wanted to talk, to unwind, to feel cared for. She expected me to listen, to be attentive, to offer comfort and make her smile again. I could almost hear her voice, light but tinged with fatigue, hoping I\u2019d be there for her.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, each expectation pressing on me, each person needing me in their own way. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how to be enough for both, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
