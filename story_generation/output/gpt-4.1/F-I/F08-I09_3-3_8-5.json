My grandson had been in a car accident\u2014nothing life-threatening, but she was shaken and needed to talk. As a grandmother, I felt the pull to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and advice, to check in on everyone and make sure they knew I was there for them. But as I paced the living room, phone pressed to my ear, I glanced out at the corridor. The HOA had posted a notice: inspection at noon. My potted plants and the old bench, which I\u2019d meant to move, still cluttered the hallway. I knew the rules\u2014shared spaces must be clear, especially for emergencies. My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had already complained once. I felt torn, the weight of my family\u2019s crisis pressing on my heart, while the responsibility to my neighbors and the building\u2019s safety nagged at my conscience. I wanted to be the reliable grandmother, the supportive neighbor, but right now, I couldn\u2019t see how to be both."}
