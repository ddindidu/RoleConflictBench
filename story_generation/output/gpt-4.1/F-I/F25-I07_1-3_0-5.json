Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d I stare at the screen, guilt prickling at me. I know she and Dad expect me to check in, especially since I moved out. They say it\u2019s just a quick text, but it always feels like more\u2014a reminder that I\u2019m still part of the family, even if it\u2019s complicated.\n\nBut my laptop is open, and the spreadsheet for the client project glares at me. The deadline is tomorrow, and my part is the last piece before the team can send it off. My manager\u2019s email from this morning is still fresh in my mind: \u201cWe\u2019re counting on you to finish this today.\u201d I can almost feel my colleagues waiting, depending on me.\n\nI want to be a good stepchild, to show I care. But I also can\u2019t let my team down. My fingers hover over my phone and keyboard, heart pounding, torn between the family that wants to hear from me and the colleagues who need me to deliver."}
