I knew she was waiting for my usual lunchtime update\u2014she liked to hear about my day, and I always tried to respond quickly, sharing little details to reassure her. But right now, I was sitting across from Maya, my mentee, who was anxiously awaiting my feedback on her project proposal. The stakes were high; a single oversight could derail weeks of work, and she needed my full attention and expertise. I could see the uncertainty in her eyes, and I wanted to be the mentor she deserved\u2014present, thoughtful, and thorough. Yet, the guilt gnawed at me as my mother\u2019s messages piled up, each one a silent reminder of the closeness we\u2019d built through our daily conversations. I felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions, each role demanding something I couldn\u2019t give at the same time. My fingers hovered over my phone, heart pounding, as I wrestled with which part of myself to honor in this moment."}
