I\u2019m scared. Can you come get me?\u201d My heart pounded. I knew she had no one else nearby, and it was late\u2014dangerous to be stranded alone. But as I glanced at the calendar on the fridge, my stomach twisted. Tomorrow morning was the open class at my stepdaughter\u2019s school, the first one since I became part of her life. She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, asking if I\u2019d be there, her eyes searching mine for reassurance. I promised I wouldn\u2019t miss it. \n\nNow, I felt pulled in two directions. My friend needed me, and I knew what it meant to be left alone in a tough spot. But my stepdaughter was counting on me to show up, to prove I was really part of her family. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen in the kitchen, torn between the person who needed me right now and the promise I\u2019d made to a child who was just learning to trust me."}
