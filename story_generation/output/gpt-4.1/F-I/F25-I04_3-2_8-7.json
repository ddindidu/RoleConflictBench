My heart pounded\u2014I hadn\u2019t meant it that way at all. I knew I needed to call her, to explain, to fix this before it grew into something bigger. But just as I reached for the phone, my stepdad walked in, his face drawn and tired. He sat down across from me, eyes searching mine, and started talking about how lost he felt since the divorce, how he didn\u2019t know if he was doing enough for me or for himself. He needed me to listen, to reassure him, to be the steady presence he was looking for. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my friend needed me to be honest and present, but my stepdad needed me to be strong and supportive. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out who needed me more in that moment, and how I could possibly be enough for both."}
