We had planned this evening for weeks, the only free night before she left for her business trip. I wanted everything to be perfect\u2014her favorite dinner, a movie, just us. As I set the table, my phone buzzed. It was my granddaughter, her message urgent: \u201cGrandma, can I call you? I really need your advice.\u201d My heart tightened. She rarely reached out like this, and I knew something serious must be weighing on her. I glanced at the clock\u2014my girlfriend would be here any minute. I felt torn, pulled between the wisdom and comfort my granddaughter needed and the promise of closeness I owed my girlfriend. Both expected my full attention, my presence, my love. I paced the kitchen, phone in hand, wrestling with the impossible choice between being the guiding grandparent and the devoted boyfriend, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
