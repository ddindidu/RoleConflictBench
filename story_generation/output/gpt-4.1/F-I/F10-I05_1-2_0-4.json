Miss you!\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014already past noon. I\u2019d meant to call her last night, but I got caught up outlining tomorrow\u2019s mentoring session. My mentee, Sarah, is counting on me to walk her through the project workflow before the big deadline. She\u2019s nervous, and I promised I\u2019d be available for questions, even outside our scheduled time. \n\nBut now, as I stare at my phone, guilt creeps in. Mom and Dad expect me to check in, to share little updates and reassure them I\u2019m okay. I know how much it means to them, especially since I moved out. Yet, my mind is tangled in lesson plans and slides, worried I\u2019ll let Sarah down if I don\u2019t give this my full attention. \n\nI want to be the reliable daughter who calls home, the mentor who\u2019s always prepared. But right now, I can\u2019t seem to be both. My thumb hovers over the call button, my laptop open to my notes, heart pulled in two directions as I try to decide which role needs me more."}
