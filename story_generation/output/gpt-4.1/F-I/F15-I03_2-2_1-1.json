She\u2019d been talking about it for weeks, practicing her lines for the little play, her eyes shining every time she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Mom?\u201d I promised her I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But as I was about to leave, my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from Alex. He\u2019d just gotten out of a meeting, and the words on the screen were heavy: \u201cCan you come over? I really need you.\u201d I could almost hear the defeat in his voice, see the slump of his shoulders. He\u2019d been working so hard, and now this setback had hit him hard. I felt my chest tighten, torn between the image of Mia scanning the crowd for me and Alex sitting alone, needing comfort. Both needed me, both expected me to show up. My heart ached as I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, paralyzed by the impossible choice."}
