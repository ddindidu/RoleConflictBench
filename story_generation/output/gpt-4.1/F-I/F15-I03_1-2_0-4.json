It was almost three, and I knew the kids would be waiting for me at the school gate, eyes searching the crowd for my face. I\u2019d promised them I\u2019d be there, just like every other Friday, to hear about their week and maybe stop for ice cream on the way home. But tonight was different. My boyfriend had been looking forward to this evening all week\u2014our only chance to be together before he left for his business trip. He\u2019d made dinner reservations at my favorite place, even picked out a movie he knew I\u2019d love. I could hear his voice in my head, \u201cI just want us to have this night.\u201d I wanted that too, but the thought of my kids waiting, feeling forgotten, twisted my stomach. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between two worlds, both needing me, both expecting me, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
