I could already picture my mom waiting by the phone, eager to hear about my week, and my dad ready with his usual questions about work and whether I was eating well. Just as I was about to dial, my phone buzzed with a message from Maya: \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m totally lost with this bookshelf and the instructions make no sense.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been having a rough week, and she rarely asked for help. My parents expected me to call on time, and I didn\u2019t want to worry them or make them feel unimportant. But Maya was counting on me too, and I could hear the frustration in her voice through her text. I stared at my phone, torn between the comfort of my family\u2019s routine and the urgency of my friend\u2019s plea, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
