My heart pounded as I tried to keep my voice steady, knowing I needed to teach him about honesty and consequences. I could see the fear and confusion in his eyes, and I wanted to comfort him, but I also knew I had to be firm. Just as I was about to talk to him, my phone buzzed. It was my best friend, calling in the middle of the night, her voice trembling with tears. She had just received terrible news about her father, and she needed me to listen, to be there for her, to help her hold herself together. I stood in the hallway, torn between my son\u2019s wide, anxious eyes and my friend\u2019s desperate sobs on the phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me, unsure which need to answer first."}
