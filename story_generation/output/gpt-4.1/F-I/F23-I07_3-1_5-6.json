The store manager\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for my response. I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable, but I could see the fear in his eyes, the way he shrank behind me. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from a colleague, marked \u201cno immediate action required,\u201d but I knew our team valued quick responses, and I prided myself on being reliable. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice reminding us to stay connected, to keep communication flowing. My stepson needed my full attention, but so did my team, in their own way. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, my mind racing between the lesson I needed to teach and the colleague waiting for a reply. I took a deep breath, torn between the roles I was supposed to fill, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
