My spouse and I are frantically cleaning, folding laundry, and scrubbing every surface because relatives are arriving tomorrow. We agreed to split the chores, but I\u2019m already behind on my share. My phone buzzes\u2014an acquaintance from work wants to chat. I answer, thinking it\u2019ll be quick, but soon she\u2019s venting about a colleague\u2019s recent mistakes. I know she expects me to listen, maybe even agree, but I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t gossip or speak ill of others. Meanwhile, my spouse calls from the kitchen, asking for help with the dishes. I feel the weight of both expectations: to be a supportive partner and a trustworthy acquaintance. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, phone pressed to my ear, torn between the demands of my home and the pressure to fit in with my acquaintance."}
