The team meeting was about to start, and this was the final discussion before we locked in the project decisions. My manager had stressed how important everyone\u2019s input was, and I knew my absence would be noticed. Just as I was about to log in, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mom: \u201cCan you call? Dad\u2019s been quiet all morning. I\u2019m worried.\u201d I knew what she needed\u2014someone to listen, to reassure her, to check if everything was okay at home. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be there for them, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last year. But the meeting was starting, and my team was counting on me to contribute. I stared at the screen, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My parents needed me as their daughter, my team needed me as their colleague, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unable to silence the anxious flutter in my chest."}
