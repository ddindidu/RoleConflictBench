I grabbed my keys and headed for the door, but just as I stepped outside, I saw Linda from down the street sitting on the curb, her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. She looked up, her eyes red and pleading, and I remembered how she\u2019d always been kind to our family, always waving hello, always ready with a smile. I felt the urge to rush over, to sit beside her and offer comfort, to be the friendly neighbor she needed right now. But my mind kept flashing to my kids, scanning the crowd for me, hoping I\u2019d keep my word this time. My heart pounded as I stood frozen on the sidewalk, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to my children and the compassion I felt for someone in pain."}
