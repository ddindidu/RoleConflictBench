The store manager\u2019s stern gaze bore into me, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as a mother. I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to show him that stealing was unacceptable, no matter how small the item. My heart pounded as I imagined his shame and confusion, but I steeled myself, knowing this was a lesson he needed.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with a weather alert\u2014tonight\u2019s storm was expected to be severe. My thoughts jumped to Mrs. Kim, my elderly neighbor who lived alone down the hall. She always relied on me to check in during emergencies, and I\u2019d promised to help her if anything happened. I pictured her sitting by her window, anxious and waiting for someone to make sure she was safe.\n\nTorn between my son\u2019s trembling hand and the thought of Mrs. Kim alone in the storm, I felt the pressure of both roles closing in. I needed to be a good mother and a good neighbor, but at that moment, I didn\u2019t know how to be both."}
