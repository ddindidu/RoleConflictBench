My mom\u2019s eyes sparkled, and my stepbrother grinned, already talking about which trail to take. I knew they wanted me there, to bond, to show I was really part of this new family. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from Jamie, my boyfriend. He was leaving for Germany on Monday, and this weekend was our last chance to be together before months apart. He wanted to spend every moment with me, just us, making memories to hold onto. My heart twisted as I tried to smile at my family, feeling their hope that I\u2019d say yes. But Jamie\u2019s words echoed in my mind, and I felt torn in two, caught between being the daughter and sister they wanted, and the girlfriend Jamie needed. I stared at my plate, wishing I could be in two places at once, dreading the choice I\u2019d have to make."}
