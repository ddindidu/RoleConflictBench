I knew they valued these small windows of connection, the way we checked in with each other after long days. I tried to focus, nodding and asking questions, but my phone buzzed insistently. It was a frantic message from my friend: their car had broken down on the highway, it was late, and they needed me to come get them right away. My heart raced. I knew my friend was counting on me\u2014helping each other in emergencies was what our friendship was built on. But my spouse was opening up, trusting me to be present and communicate, not just in words but in attention. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing in. I wanted to be the reliable friend, the attentive partner, but right now, I couldn\u2019t see how to be both. My mind spun as I stared at my phone, caught between the urgent need of my friend and the quiet, important need of my spouse."}
