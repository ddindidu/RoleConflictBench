My parents chimed in, asking if I could clear my schedule to join. I could see the hope in their eyes\u2014they wanted all of us together, something we hadn\u2019t managed in months. I wanted to say yes, to be the sister who showed up, who made memories with them. But in the back of my mind, I kept thinking about the project at work. My manager had just reminded me that my part was crucial for the client delivery, and the deadline was Monday morning. If I didn\u2019t finish my tasks over the weekend, the whole team would be delayed, and the client would be disappointed. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s expectation for togetherness, my team\u2019s reliance on my work. My heart ached as I listened to my brother\u2019s plans, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
