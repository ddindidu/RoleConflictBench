She needed my guidance tonight\u2014her deadline was tomorrow, and she was counting on me to help her weigh the pros and cons, to give her the confidence to make a life-changing decision. But across the room, my husband sat slumped on the couch, his eyes red and distant. He\u2019d barely spoken all evening, and I knew he was struggling, needing me to be present, to listen, to reassure him that things would be okay. My heart ached as I glanced between my phone and my husband, feeling the weight of both their needs pressing down on me. I wanted to be the anchor for him, to hold his hand and promise I\u2019d be there no matter what. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t let Sarah down\u2014not when she was so close to a breakthrough. The clock ticked on, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, torn by the impossible demands of being both a devoted wife and a responsible mentor."}
