He\u2019d been talking about this new trick for days, but the ramp was steeper and rougher than anything he\u2019d tried before. As his step-sibling, I knew Mom would expect me to keep him safe, to speak up if I thought he was about to do something reckless. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my mentor, asking for an update on the group project. The truth was, my teammates and I had just had a blowout argument, and now the whole project was at risk. I was supposed to be honest with my mentor, to let her know about any problems right away, but I hadn\u2019t told her yet. My chest tightened as I glanced between Max, poised to launch himself down the ramp, and my phone, vibrating insistently. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014should I rush to stop Max, or finally call my mentor and admit the project was falling apart? The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, unable to choose."}
