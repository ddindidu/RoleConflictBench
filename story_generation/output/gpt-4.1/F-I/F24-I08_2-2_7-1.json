He grinned at me, expecting the usual cheerleading, but all I could think about was the time he\u2019d scraped his arm last month. As his step-sibling, I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014should I stop him, or at least warn him about the risks? But before I could say anything, my phone buzzed. Across the park, my classmate waved me over, introducing me to a new girl who looked like she wanted to disappear into her hoodie. As an acquaintance, I was supposed to be warm and welcoming, help her feel at ease. I tried to split my attention, nodding and smiling at her, but my eyes kept darting back to my brother, who was now at the top of the ramp, ready to launch. My heart pounded, torn between the urge to rush over and protect him, and the need to be present and kind to someone who clearly needed a friend."}
