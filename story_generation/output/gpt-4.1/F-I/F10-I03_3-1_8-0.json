Can we talk?\u201d I glanced up at my mom, her eyes red and voice trembling as she confided in me about her worries\u2014Dad\u2019s health, her own loneliness, the weight she carried. She needed me, right now, to listen, to reassure her that things would be okay. I reached for her hand, feeling her grip tighten, her need for comfort almost palpable.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again. My partner rarely asked for support, and I knew he must be feeling low to reach out like this. I could picture him, sitting alone in his apartment, waiting for me to call, to be the person he could lean on. My heart twisted. I wanted to be there for both of them, to be the daughter my mom needed and the girlfriend my partner deserved. But I only had so much to give, and I could feel myself being pulled in two directions, guilt and worry battling inside me as I tried to decide who needed me more in this moment."}
