The first message was from my mom, asking how my day was going and if I\u2019d eaten yet. She always expected me to reply quickly, and I knew she\u2019d worry if I didn\u2019t. The second was a call from Mark, an acquaintance from work. His voice trembled as he explained his car had broken down on a deserted road, and he needed someone to pick him up. I glanced at the clock\u2014almost dinner time, when my parents usually expected a call. My fingers hovered over the screen, torn. If I left right away to help Mark, I\u2019d miss my parents\u2019 call and break our daily routine, something that always made them anxious. But if I stayed to talk to my parents, I\u2019d be letting Mark down when he needed help the most. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt my chest tighten as I tried to figure out what to do."}
