She rarely opened up, but tonight she poured out her worries about Dad\u2019s health, her loneliness, and how much she needed me. I could hear the hope in her voice, the silent plea for me to come over, to sit with her, to be the daughter she could lean on. My heart ached\u2014I wanted to be there for her, to hold her hand and reassure her that everything would be okay.\n\nBut as I hung up, my phone buzzed again. It was Alex, my boyfriend, reminding me about our plans. We\u2019d been looking forward to this evening all week\u2014the only night we\u2019d have together before he left for his business trip. He\u2019d made reservations at my favorite restaurant, and I knew how much this meant to him, to us. I stared at the messages, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My parents needed me. Alex needed me. I felt torn in two, guilt and anxiety swirling inside me as I tried to figure out how to be everything to everyone, knowing I couldn\u2019t."}
