My heart sank. As a father, I knew I had to teach him about honesty and consequences, but I also didn\u2019t want to embarrass him in public. Just as I was about to address it, I spotted an old acquaintance near the checkout, her eyes red and cheeks streaked with tears. She looked up and tried to smile, clearly needing someone to talk to. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my son needed guidance and discipline, but my acquaintance needed comfort and a listening ear. I could feel my chest tighten as I tried to figure out how to be the father my son needed in this moment, while also being the supportive, approachable person my acquaintance expected. The demands of both roles pulled me in opposite directions, and I stood there, torn, unsure which responsibility to face first."}
