She\u2019s already handled dinner and helped with homework; it\u2019s only fair I do my part. But my phone buzzes again\u2014my mentor\u2019s name lighting up the screen. I\u2019m supposed to let him know right away if I hit any snags, and right now, I\u2019m completely stuck on a bug that\u2019s derailing my project. He\u2019s always emphasized the importance of transparency and quick communication, and I don\u2019t want to let him down or seem unreliable. My mind races, torn between the expectation to be a dependable partner at home and a responsible, proactive mentee at work. I can feel the pressure building in my chest, the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. I glance at the laundry, then at my phone, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
