We\u2019d just moved in last week, and Mom kept reminding me how important it was to make a good impression. I wanted to be friendly, to show everyone I could be a polite and thoughtful neighbor. Just as I wrapped the cake, Mom came in, her eyes red and tired. She sat down heavily and started talking about how hard the move had been, how lonely she felt, and how much she missed our old home. She looked at me, searching for comfort, her voice trembling. I felt her need for me to be there, to listen and reassure her. But I could hear voices outside\u2014our new neighbors were in their yard, the perfect chance to introduce myself and share the cake. My heart pounded as I stood between the kitchen and the door, torn between being the supportive child my mom needed and the friendly neighbor I was expected to be."}
