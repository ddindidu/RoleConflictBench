Call us when you can.\u201d I glance at the clock, guilt prickling at me. I haven\u2019t called home in over a week, and I know my parents worry if I go too long without checking in. I type a quick reply, promising to call later, but my laptop screen pulls my attention back. There\u2019s a project deadline looming\u2014my part is due tonight, and if I don\u2019t finish, my teammate can\u2019t start her section tomorrow. The pressure is mounting; I can almost feel my colleague\u2019s anxious anticipation through our group chat. I want to be the reliable teammate who never lets anyone down, but I also want to be the caring daughter who makes time for her family. My mind races, torn between dialing my parents and diving back into spreadsheets, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in from either side."}
