My husband poured us both tea, settling across from me with a gentle smile. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d he asked, his eyes searching mine for more than just a routine answer. I knew he wanted me to share, to really talk, not just skim the surface. I wanted to give him that\u2014he deserved it. But my phone buzzed again: a reminder for the team meeting starting in five minutes. This was the last discussion before we finalized the project, and my input was expected. My manager had emphasized how crucial everyone\u2019s participation was. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My husband waited, patient but hopeful, while my colleagues waited, expecting my voice in the virtual room. My heart raced as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me."}
