The spreadsheet deadline loomed\u2014my part was the last piece before the client presentation tomorrow. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen. It was a message from my granddaughter: \u201cGrandma, can I talk to you? It\u2019s important.\u201d My heart squeezed. She rarely reached out like this, and I knew she wouldn\u2019t unless it was serious. I could hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me how crucial this delivery was, how everyone was counting on me to finish my section tonight. But my granddaughter\u2019s words echoed louder, her trust in me, her need for guidance. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. My family expected my wisdom and comfort; my colleagues expected my reliability and focus. I stared at the blinking cursor, my mind racing, caught between the urgent needs of work and the deeper call of family."}
