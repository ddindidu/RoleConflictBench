Dad seems down today.\u201d I knew how much it meant to them when I checked in, especially after Dad\u2019s health scare last month. I started typing a quick reply, but then my calendar pinged\u2014a reminder for my mentor session in ten minutes. She\u2019d squeezed me in right before her flight, making it clear this was the only time she had for weeks. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. If I called my parents now, I\u2019d be late for the session, disrespecting my mentor\u2019s time and possibly missing out on her advice. But if I ignored my parents, I\u2019d be letting them down when they needed me most. My thumb hovered over the call button, my mind racing between the two worlds I was supposed to hold together."}
