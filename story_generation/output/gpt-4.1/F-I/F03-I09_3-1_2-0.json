She expected me to check in every evening, to share how my day went and listen to her stories. I knew she worried if I didn\u2019t reply quickly. As I reached my apartment door, I saw Mrs. Lee, my neighbor, coming down the corridor. She always greeted me with a warm smile and a few kind words, and I knew she valued these small exchanges. Today, though, my mind was racing with thoughts of my mom\u2019s waiting messages. I wanted to be polite and friendly, to stop and chat with Mrs. Lee as she expected, but I also felt the pull of my role as a son, the need to reassure my mom that I was okay. My phone vibrated again, and I felt a wave of guilt and anxiety. I stood there, caught between the urge to be a good neighbor and the responsibility to be a caring son, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
