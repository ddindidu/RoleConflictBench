The assignment wasn\u2019t due for weeks, but I wanted to impress her, to show I was serious about learning. I had the article open on my phone, eyes scanning the lines as I waited for my stepbrother, Jamie, to catch up. He was always in a rush, always darting ahead. \n\nAs I tried to focus on the dense text, I saw Jamie out of the corner of my eye, stepping off the curb, not even glancing at the traffic light. My heart lurched. I knew I was supposed to look out for him\u2014Mom had made that clear when we became a family. But if I stopped reading now, I\u2019d lose my train of thought, and I\u2019d fall behind on the assignment. My mentor expected me to be diligent, to take initiative. But Jamie\u2019s safety was in my hands, too. I felt torn, my feet rooted to the spot, my mind racing between the words on the screen and the real world rushing by."}
