Can we talk later?\u201d I glanced up to see my mom wiping her eyes, my dad\u2019s hand resting gently on her shoulder. They\u2019d just told me about Dad\u2019s health scare\u2014something they\u2019d kept quiet until now. My mom\u2019s voice trembled as she asked, \u201cCan you stay with us tonight? We just need you here.\u201d I could feel the weight of their need, the silent plea for comfort and reassurance.\n\nBut Mia\u2019s message tugged at me. She rarely asked for help, and I knew how much she valued our evening talks to unwind. I imagined her waiting, hoping I\u2019d listen and make her feel less alone. My parents needed me, but so did Mia. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how to be present for both, feeling the pressure of their expectations pulling me in opposite directions.
