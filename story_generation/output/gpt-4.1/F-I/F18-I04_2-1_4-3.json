It was Mia, my best friend, her message popping up with a frantic, \u201cCan you please call me? I\u2019m stuck with this bookshelf and the instructions make no sense.\u201d I could almost hear the frustration in her words. At the same time, I could hear my mom calling from the kitchen, reminding me not to be late\u2014she\u2019d made my favorite dish, and everyone was waiting for me to start eating. I knew how much these family dinners meant, especially since we didn\u2019t get together like this often anymore. But Mia rarely asked for help, and I knew she\u2019d been having a rough week. She needed me, and I wanted to be there for her. My heart pounded as I stood at the top of the stairs, phone in hand, torn between the warmth of my family downstairs and the friend who needed me right now. I hesitated, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which way to turn."}
