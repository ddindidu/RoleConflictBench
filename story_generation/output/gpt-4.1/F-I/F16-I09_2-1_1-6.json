They needed me\u2014really needed me\u2014to listen, to help them sort through the mess of choices at work. I could see how much they depended on my support, how much they wanted to feel heard and reassured. I reached for their hand, but my phone buzzed with a message from our neighbor: \u201cCould you please grab my package if it arrives today? I\u2019m stuck at work again.\u201d I glanced at the clock. The delivery window overlapped with the time my partner wanted to talk. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in. My partner\u2019s eyes searched mine for comfort, while my neighbor\u2019s trust in me to help out tugged at my sense of responsibility. I wanted to be there for both, but the demands pulled me in opposite directions, leaving me torn and anxious, unsure which need to answer first."}
