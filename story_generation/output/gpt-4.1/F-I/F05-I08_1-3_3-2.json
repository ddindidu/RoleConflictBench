My wife had mentioned, not unkindly, that she was hoping I\u2019d help out more, especially since we\u2019d both been so busy. I could hear her in the kitchen, the clatter of dishes a gentle reminder of the partnership we\u2019d promised each other. I set the basket down, determined to finally tackle the chore.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mark, an old acquaintance from work. He was outside, needing to talk. When I opened the door, I found him on the porch, eyes red and voice trembling as he started to share about a recent loss. He needed someone to listen, someone to be present and kind.\n\nI felt the weight of the laundry behind me, the silent expectation of my wife, and the raw vulnerability of Mark in front of me. My mind raced, torn between being the supportive husband at home and the compassionate acquaintance outside. I stood there, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both needed me in different ways."}
