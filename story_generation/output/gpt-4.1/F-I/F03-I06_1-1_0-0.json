Call us when you can.\u201d I glance at the screen, feeling a familiar tug of guilt. I haven\u2019t called home in over a week, and I know my parents worry if I go too long without checking in. I type out a quick reply\u2014\u201cWill call soon!\u201d\u2014but don\u2019t hit send. My laptop is open in front of me, a PDF from my mentor staring back at me. She\u2019d suggested I read a few chapters, not urgent, but she always notices who takes initiative. I want to impress her, to show I\u2019m serious about my growth. But the thought of calling home lingers, the expectation to be a good son pressing on me. I can\u2019t focus on the reading, but I can\u2019t bring myself to call either, knowing it\u2019ll turn into a long conversation. I sit there, torn, the weight of both roles heavy on my shoulders, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
