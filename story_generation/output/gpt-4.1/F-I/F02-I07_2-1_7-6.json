My wife was in the next room, sorting through bills and grocery lists, her face tight with worry. I knew we were cutting it close this month\u2014rent, utilities, and the kids\u2019 school fees all looming. I needed to focus on work, to make sure I kept my job and the steady paycheck that kept us afloat. \n\nBut the email was from a colleague, marked \u201cinformational\u2014no action needed.\u201d Still, I knew the unspoken rule: respond quickly, show you\u2019re engaged, be a team player. My manager had mentioned it in my last review\u2014\u201cWe value responsiveness here.\u201d I could hear my son calling for help with his homework, and my wife\u2019s voice, low and anxious, discussing expenses. \n\nI stared at the screen, torn. If I replied now, I\u2019d be the reliable colleague, but I\u2019d lose precious minutes with my family, who needed reassurance and support. If I waited, I risked seeming disengaged at work, and that could threaten the very stability I was trying to protect. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my mind pulled in two directions, heart pounding with the weight of both worlds."}
