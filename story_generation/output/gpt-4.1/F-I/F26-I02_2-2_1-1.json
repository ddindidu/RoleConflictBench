I had a rough day.\u201d I glanced up to see my granddaughter shuffling into the room, her shoulders slumped, eyes downcast. She\u2019d been quiet all afternoon, and I could sense she needed someone to talk to, someone to help her make sense of whatever was weighing on her. As a grandparent, I felt the urge to offer her comfort, to share some wisdom, to be the steady presence she could lean on. But my partner\u2019s text tugged at me too\u2014she needed me, needed my support and understanding after her disappointment at work. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. Both of them expected me to be there, to listen, to care. I wanted to be the wise grandparent and the supportive boyfriend, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The weight of their needs pressed on me, and I sat frozen, unsure which way to turn first."}
