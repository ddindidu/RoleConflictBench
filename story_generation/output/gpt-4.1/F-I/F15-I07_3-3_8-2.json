My mind raced with numbers\u2014bills, groceries, the kids\u2019 school fees. I needed to keep my job secure, maybe even push for that promotion, to make sure we didn\u2019t fall behind. Just as I was calculating how much I could save this month, a notification popped up: \u201cFinal team meeting, 3 PM today.\u201d My heart sank. This meeting would decide the direction of our project, and my input was expected. Missing it could mean being sidelined, or worse, being seen as unreliable. But at the same time, my youngest had a fever, and my partner was stuck at work. I was supposed to pick up medicine and be home early. The pressure from both sides squeezed me\u2014my family counting on me to keep us afloat, my team counting on me to show up and contribute. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
