The kids finish school in fifteen minutes, and I promised I\u2019d be there to pick them up today. They\u2019ve been looking forward to it all week, and I can already picture their faces scanning the crowd, hoping to spot me. But my inbox pings again, and I\u2019m snapped back to the spreadsheet in front of me. The client is waiting for our numbers, and my part is the last piece before the team can send the final report. My colleagues are counting on me; the deadline is non-negotiable. I feel the weight of their expectations pressing down, knowing a delay from me could throw off the whole project. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cSchool pick-up.\u201d I rub my temples, torn between the promise I made to my children and the responsibility I owe my team. The minutes tick by, and I can feel the pressure mounting from both sides, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
