My husband had mentioned, not unkindly, that he was running out of clean shirts for work, and I knew it was my turn to fold and put things away. I sighed, rolled up my sleeves, and started sorting socks when my phone buzzed. It was Mia, my oldest friend, her voice shaky and urgent. She was already on her way to the airport, convinced she\u2019d left her passport at home. \u201cCan you check? And if it\u2019s here, can you bring it? My flight\u2019s in two hours,\u201d she pleaded.\n\nI glanced at the laundry, then at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d barely make it to the airport in time, but the laundry would have to wait\u2014again. My husband would come home to the same mess, and I could already feel the tension building. But Mia was counting on me; she had no one else nearby. My mind raced, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to share the load at home and the unspoken vow to always be there for my friends in a crisis. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more."}
