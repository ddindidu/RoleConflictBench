First, a message from my daughter: \u201cDad, can you call? It\u2019s about Sam. He\u2019s not doing well.\u201d My grandson, always so full of life, now facing something I couldn\u2019t ignore. I knew my family expected me to be present, to check in, to offer the steady hand I\u2019d always tried to provide. But before I could even process that, another message flashed on my screen\u2014this one from Mia. \u201cWe need to talk. I can\u2019t keep fighting like this.\u201d The argument we\u2019d had last night still echoed in my mind, her words sharp, my own regret sharper. As her boyfriend, I owed her my attention, my willingness to work through our problems, to show her she mattered. I stared at the phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My family needed me, but so did Mia. I could hear the expectation in both their voices, and I felt myself pulled in two, heart pounding, unable to move."}
