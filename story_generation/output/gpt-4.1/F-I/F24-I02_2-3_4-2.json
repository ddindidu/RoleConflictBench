My stepdad had emphasized how important it was for me to be there, to show I was really part of the family now. I could almost hear my mom\u2019s voice, gentle but firm, telling me how much it would mean to her if I joined. But my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from Mia. She\u2019d barely slept since her brother died, and her words were raw, desperate: \u201cCan you come over? I just\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be alone tonight.\u201d\n\nMy chest tightened. I wanted to be there for Mia, to hold her and let her cry, to be the boyfriend she needed. But I also knew how fragile things were at home, how much my presence at dinner mattered to my new family. I felt pulled in two directions, guilt gnawing at me no matter which way I turned. I sat on the edge of my bed, phone in hand, heart pounding, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
