My stepbrother\u2019s text glowed on the screen: \u201cCan you come over? I really need you.\u201d He\u2019d just found out his dad was sick again, and I knew he was barely holding it together. As his step-sister, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to help him through the worst of it. But my phone vibrated again\u2014this time, it was my boyfriend. \u201cWe need to talk. I can\u2019t keep fighting about money. Can you come over?\u201d We\u2019d argued three times this week, and I could feel the tension building, threatening to break us apart if I didn\u2019t try to fix things soon.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at the two messages. Both needed me, both expected me to show up, to be present, to help. I felt torn in two, guilt gnawing at me no matter which way I turned. I wanted to be the supportive sister, but I also wanted to be the girlfriend who didn\u2019t run away from problems. My hands shook as I tried to decide who needed me more, and who I would let down tonight."}
