It was the principal, her voice tense as she explained that my son had been caught bullying a classmate. My heart sank. I knew I had to be there, to talk with the teachers, to show my son that I take this seriously, to help him understand the gravity of his actions. As I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed again\u2014a frantic call from my best friend. Her car had broken down on the highway, miles away, and she sounded scared. She needed me right now, and I could hear the panic in her voice. I felt torn in two. My child needed me to be a responsible parent, to address his mistake and support him through this. But my friend was alone, vulnerable, and counting on me to come to her rescue. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding, unsure which way to turn."}
