My husband had an early meeting tomorrow, and my daughter needed her uniform for a school trip. I knew if I didn\u2019t get the laundry done tonight, tomorrow would start with stress and disappointment. But just as I reached for the detergent, my phone buzzed. It was Maya, my mentee, her message urgent: \u201cCan you talk? I\u2019m panicking about tomorrow\u2019s presentation. I don\u2019t think I can do it.\u201d I could hear the anxiety in her words, the kind that could unravel months of hard work and confidence. As a mentor, I\u2019d promised to be there, to help her grow and face challenges head-on. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the needs of my family and the needs of someone who depended on my guidance. I stood in the laundry room, phone in hand, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
