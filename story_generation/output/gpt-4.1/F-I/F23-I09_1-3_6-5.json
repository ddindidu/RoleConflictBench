He\u2019d been waiting for weeks, and I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d make it happen, even if it meant stretching the budget. I\u2019d hidden it in the corridor closet, just until his birthday. But now, the HOA had posted a notice: inspection tomorrow, and anything left in the shared corridor would be cited. My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, had already complained about clutter, and I knew the rules were strict. As a step-parent, I wanted to keep my promise to Jamie, to show him he could count on me. But as a neighbor, I was expected to respect the shared space and not risk a fine for everyone. My heart pounded as I stared at the closet door, torn between keeping my word to Jamie and being the responsible neighbor everyone expected."}
