I could sense the weight they carried, the silent plea for guidance. As a grandparent, I felt the urge to share my own stories of overcoming doubt, to offer wisdom and comfort. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a group of acquaintances, inviting me to join their conversation nearby. When I arrived, the topic had shifted to a mutual colleague\u2019s recent choices. The group expected me to listen quietly, maybe even join in, but never to speak ill or spread rumors. Yet, I knew that my grandchild\u2019s struggles were tangled up with this very colleague, and sharing my perspective might help the group understand, or perhaps even help my grandchild indirectly. My heart tugged in two directions: the responsibility to guide my grandchild with honesty, and the expectation to remain neutral and avoid gossip among acquaintances. I felt the tension rise within me, unsure which role I should honor in this moment."}
