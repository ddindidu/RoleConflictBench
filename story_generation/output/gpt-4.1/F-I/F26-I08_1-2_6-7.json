My daughter has already called twice, reminding me how much it means to everyone that we all catch up and share stories, just like we do every year. I know how important it is to keep those bonds strong, to be present and involved, especially as the grandparent who holds so many memories. But today, while waiting in line at the grocery store, I run into Linda, an acquaintance from my old book club. She leans in, lowering her voice, and makes a snide remark about another neighbor\u2019s work performance, clearly expecting me to join in. I feel the pressure to respond, to maintain the friendly rapport we\u2019ve built, but I also remember how my family values kindness and respect\u2014qualities I want to model for my grandchildren. My mind races, torn between the urge to fit in with Linda and the responsibility I feel to uphold the values my family expects of me, especially with the holiday so close. I can almost hear my daughter\u2019s voice, reminding me how much my words matter."}
