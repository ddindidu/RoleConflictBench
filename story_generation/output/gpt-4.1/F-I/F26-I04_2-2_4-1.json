The kids\u2019 eyes sparkled with curiosity, and I could feel the anticipation in the air. Just as she began to speak, my phone buzzed. It was my oldest friend, Linda. Her voice trembled as she asked if I had a moment\u2014she needed to talk about a terrible argument she\u2019d just had with her partner. I could hear the pain in her words, and I knew she was reaching out because she trusted me to listen and help her through it. At the same time, my family was looking to me, expecting me to be present and share in this special moment. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the family who wanted my attention and the friend who needed my support. I felt a knot tighten in my chest as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
