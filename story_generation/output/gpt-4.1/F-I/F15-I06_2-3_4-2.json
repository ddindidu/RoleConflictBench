The assignment needed to be finished tonight, no excuses\u2014tomorrow was the big evaluation, and my mentor had made it clear how much was riding on this. My mind raced with ideas and deadlines as I pushed the shopping cart, my son darting ahead, weaving between displays and giggling. I knew I should stop him, kneel down, and explain why running in the supermarket wasn\u2019t safe or respectful. That\u2019s what a good parent would do\u2014teach him discipline, help him understand right from wrong. But every second I spent here, not working on the assignment, felt like a betrayal of my mentor\u2019s trust and my own ambitions. My heart pounded with guilt and frustration. Should I pull my son aside and risk losing precious time, or let it slide just this once so I could get home and finish the task? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen in the aisle, torn between the parent my child needed and the mentee I was expected to be."}
