My daughter had just called, her voice trembling as she told me about my grandson\u2019s sudden hospitalization. As a grandfather, I knew I should be there for my family, checking in, offering comfort, making sure everyone felt supported. But just as I was about to call my daughter back, my partner walked in, her shoulders slumped, eyes tired. She tried to smile, but I could see the weight of her day pressing down on her. She needed me too\u2014needed me to listen, to hold her, to be present and attentive, not distracted by distant worries.\n\nI felt torn, pulled in two directions by the people I love. My family expected me to be the steady anchor, the one who always reaches out, while my partner hoped for my undivided attention and care. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety swirling as I tried to decide who needed me more in this moment, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
