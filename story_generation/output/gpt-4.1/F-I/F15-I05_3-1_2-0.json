My heart sank as I read the words: \u201cYour child was involved in a bullying incident.\u201d As a parent, I knew I was expected to show up, to be present at the meeting the school requested, to support my child but also hold them accountable. I could already picture my child\u2019s anxious face, waiting for me to help them make sense of what happened.\n\nBut just as I was about to reply, my phone buzzed. It was one of my mentees, asking if I had a moment to talk about a job offer they\u2019d just received. They sounded nervous, and I knew how much my guidance meant to them. As a mentor, I was expected to be available, to offer thoughtful advice, especially in moments like this.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My child needed me to be a parent, present and attentive. My mentee needed me to be a mentor, wise and supportive. I stared at my phone, caught between two worlds, unsure which call to answer first."}
