I knew I should call him back, remind him about respecting public spaces and behaving properly\u2014after all, teaching him discipline is part of being a good mother. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my mentor, asking if I had any questions about the new project. I did have a small question about a term she\u2019d used, and I knew she expected me to communicate openly, even about minor things. I hesitated, torn between chasing after my son and quickly typing out my question before I lost my nerve. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: be the attentive mother, or the proactive mentee. The cart wobbled as I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, both demanding my immediate attention."}
