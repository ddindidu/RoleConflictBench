My husband paced the room, his face drawn with worry. He\u2019d just told me about the ultimatum his boss gave him\u2014take on a risky project or risk being sidelined. He needed me, I could see it in his eyes, the way he searched my face for reassurance, for the right words to help him decide. But as he spoke, my phone lit up with a message from my friend: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that. I thought you understood me.\u201d My heart clenched. I\u2019d made a careless comment earlier, and now she was hurt, maybe even questioning our friendship. I knew I needed to call her, to explain, to apologize before the misunderstanding grew. But my husband\u2019s voice trembled as he asked, \u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d I felt torn, pulled in two directions by people I loved, both needing me in different ways, both expecting me to be there for them right now. My chest tightened as I stared at my phone, caught between the urge to comfort my husband and the need to make things right with my friend."}
