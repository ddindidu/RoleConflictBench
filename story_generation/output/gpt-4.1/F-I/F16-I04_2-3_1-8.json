My partner\u2019s eyes were red, their voice trembling as they recounted the impossible choice their boss had given them. They needed me\u2014needed my full attention, my comfort, my words to help them feel less alone in the storm. But as I reached out to hold their hand, my phone vibrated again. A message from my friend flashed on the screen, short and sharp: \u201cCan we talk?\u201d My stomach twisted. I\u2019d just realized the offhand joke I made earlier had cut deeper than I\u2019d ever intended. I knew I had to call, to explain, to fix what I\u2019d broken before the silence grew into something worse. My partner\u2019s hand squeezed mine, searching for reassurance, while my friend waited on the other end of the line, hurting because of me. I felt split in two, torn between being the anchor my partner needed and the honest friend I wanted to be. The weight of both expectations pressed down, and I sat frozen, phone in hand, heart pounding, unsure which need to answer first."}
