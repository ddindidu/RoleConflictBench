The numbers glared at me\u2014two months until the home loan repayment was due, and I needed to find a way to tighten our spending. As a step-parent, I felt the weight of ensuring our family\u2019s financial stability, especially with my partner trusting me to keep us afloat. Just as I started mapping out a plan, my phone buzzed. It was Maya, my mentee, asking if I could review her project draft before tomorrow\u2019s deadline. She\u2019d been struggling, and I\u2019d promised to guide her through this tough stretch, offering regular check-ins and feedback. I glanced at the clock, knowing that every hour spent mentoring was an hour I couldn\u2019t use to pick up extra freelance work or research ways to save money. My heart twisted with guilt\u2014Maya needed me, but so did my family. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unsure how to be the support each needed without letting the other down."}
