She\u2019d had a rough day at work, and I could hear the tears she was trying to hide. \u201cCan you come over?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. I knew she needed me, and as her sister, I wanted nothing more than to be there for her, to hold her hand and remind her she wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nBut as I stood up, my dog started barking wildly at the sound of footsteps in the hallway. I remembered the note my neighbor had left on my door just yesterday, politely asking me to keep my dog quiet, especially in the evenings. They had a newborn, and the barking was waking the baby. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. If I left now, my dog would bark even more, disturbing my neighbors and breaking the unspoken rule of being considerate in our shared space. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting my sister down when she needed me most. I stood frozen, torn between the pull of family and the responsibility of being a good neighbor, my heart pounding as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides."}
