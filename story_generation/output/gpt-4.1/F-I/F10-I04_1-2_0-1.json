Hope you and Dad are well.\u201d I knew she liked hearing from me on weekends, and I tried to keep up the habit, even if it was just a short message. As I set my phone down, it buzzed again\u2014this time, it was my friend, Sarah. Her name flashed on the screen, and when I answered, her voice was shaky. \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now,\u201d she said, barely holding back tears. I could hear the pain in her words, and I knew she expected me to listen, to be there for her like I always promised. But just as I was about to respond, my mom replied, asking if I could call her for a quick chat. She missed me, and I hadn\u2019t spoken to her all week. My heart twisted as I stared at my phone, torn between being the daughter my mom hoped for and the friend Sarah needed."}
