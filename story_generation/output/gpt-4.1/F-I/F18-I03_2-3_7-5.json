It was our last weekend together before he left for his job overseas, and we\u2019d planned a whole day just for us. But right in front of me, my little brother, Max, was strapping on his helmet, determined to try a new trick on the steepest, roughest ramp in the park. He looked at me, grinning, but I could see the nerves in his eyes. Mom always said to look out for him, and I knew if anything happened, I\u2019d never forgive myself. Jamie\u2019s messages grew more insistent\u2014he wanted every minute we could get before his flight. My heart twisted as I watched Max wobble at the top of the ramp, while Jamie\u2019s name flashed on my screen. I felt torn in two, desperate not to let either of them down, but knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
