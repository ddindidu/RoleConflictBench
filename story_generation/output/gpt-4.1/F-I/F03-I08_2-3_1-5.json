It was Mark, an acquaintance from work. His message was urgent: his car had broken down on a deserted road, and he needed someone to pick him up. I glanced at the clock\u20147:00 p.m., the exact time my parents expected my call. They always looked forward to our weekly chats, and I knew my mom would worry if I didn\u2019t call on time. At the same time, Mark sounded desperate, and I remembered how he\u2019d helped me once when I was in a bind. I felt torn, my thumb hovering over the call button for my parents while Mark\u2019s message blinked on my screen. My mind raced with guilt and anxiety, caught between the comfort of my family\u2019s expectations and the immediate need of someone who was counting on me."}
