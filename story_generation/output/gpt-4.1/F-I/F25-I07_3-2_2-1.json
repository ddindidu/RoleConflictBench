She and Dad expected me to check in every day, to share how things were going, and to reply quickly. It was our routine, a way to keep close even though I\u2019d moved out. But today, the meeting was crucial\u2014my manager had made it clear that everyone\u2019s input was needed, and the updates wouldn\u2019t be sent out afterward. I stared at the screen, torn. If I ignored the message, my parents would worry, maybe even feel hurt, thinking I was pulling away. But if I started typing now, I\u2019d be distracted, maybe miss my chance to contribute, or worse, seem uncommitted to the team. My heart pounded as I hovered between the chat app and the meeting link, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention at the same time."}
