She looked up and smiled, but I could tell something was off. \u201cRough day?\u201d I asked, sitting beside her. She shrugged, trying to brush it off, but I knew she wanted me to listen, to be present, to offer comfort. I reached for her hand, but my mind kept drifting to the article my mentor had recommended earlier. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I wanted to impress him, to show I was dedicated.
