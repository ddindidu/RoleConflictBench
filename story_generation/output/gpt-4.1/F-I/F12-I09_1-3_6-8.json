She reminded me about her package delivery and the planned power outage tomorrow. She asked if I could keep an eye out and maybe store her package at my place, just in case. I agreed, knowing how much we neighbors rely on each other for these little things. As I set the phone down, my husband walked in, looking tired. We started our usual chat about our days, but I hesitated to mention the extra responsibility. He\u2019s been worried about our own fridge during outages, and I know he expects me to be open about anything that might affect us. I felt torn\u2014wanting to help Mrs. Lee, but also not wanting to add to my husband\u2019s stress or hide things from him. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I found myself caught between the urge to support my neighbor and the need to be honest and considerate as a wife."}
