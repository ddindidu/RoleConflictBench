As a grandparent, I knew how much these gatherings meant\u2014my family expected me to be present, to listen, to share stories, to keep our bonds strong. But as I set my phone down, my laptop chimed with a reminder: \u201cCode sample due in three days.\u201d My mentor had been clear\u2014this assignment was crucial for my progress, and I was determined not to let them down. The code was complex, and I needed hours of focused work to finish it. The pressure built inside me, tugging me in two directions. I wanted to be the reliable grandparent my family counted on, but I also wanted to prove myself as a dedicated mentee.
