My heart pounded as the store clerk\u2019s stern gaze flicked between us. As her step-parent, I knew I had to teach her right from wrong, to guide her with patience and firmness. She looked up at me, eyes wide and brimming with fear, and I felt the weight of her trust pressing on my shoulders.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that my mentor\u2019s office hours were starting in ten minutes. I\u2019d promised to respect her time, to show up prepared and punctual, especially since she\u2019d made herself available just for me this week. I could almost hear her gentle but firm voice: \u201cConsistency is key, both in learning and in relationships.\u201d\n\nI glanced at my stepdaughter, then at the clock, feeling the two worlds pulling me apart. I needed to address what she\u2019d done, to be present for her in this moment, but I also couldn\u2019t let my mentor down. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how to be both the guide she needed and the mentee I aspired to be."}
