My husband called from the living room, asking if I could help him move the furniture before his parents arrived. The house was a whirlwind of half-finished chores, and I felt the pressure mounting\u2014everything had to be spotless before our relatives walked through the door. My phone buzzed on the counter. It was a message from Priya, my mentee, apologizing for missing another deadline. She sounded defeated, and I knew she needed guidance, maybe even a call to talk things through. As a mentor, I was supposed to be available, to encourage her and help her find her footing. But as a wife, I was expected to be present, to share the load and make our home welcoming. I could feel the tension knotting in my chest, torn between the urge to support Priya and the responsibility to my family. The weight of both roles pressed in, and I stood frozen, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
