She\u2019d snapped at me for not listening, and I knew I should have been more patient, more understanding of her point of view. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014mutual respect, even when we disagreed. But my mind kept drifting back to the group project at work. My teammates and I were at a standstill, and the deadline was looming. My mentor had always told me to communicate challenges early, to be honest about any roadblocks. I could feel the weight of her expectations pressing on me, urging me to send that email, to ask for help before things got worse. But if I did, I\u2019d have to admit I couldn\u2019t manage the conflict on my own. My sister\u2019s words echoed in my head, reminding me to be patient, to try harder to understand others. I stared at the screen, torn between reaching out to my mentor and trying, one more time, to fix things with my team. My heart pounded as I wondered which role I was about to let down."}
