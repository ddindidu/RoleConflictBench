Call us when you can.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014my team\u2019s weekly catch-up meeting starts in ten minutes. I know the meeting will be recorded, and it\u2019s not urgent, but I also know my manager expects everyone to show up and contribute, even if it\u2019s just routine. At the same time, I haven\u2019t spoken to my parents all week, and I can almost hear the disappointment in Mom\u2019s voice if I put off calling again. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing on me: my parents want to feel connected, to know I\u2019m okay, while my team expects me to be present and engaged. I stare at my phone, torn between dialing home and logging into Zoom, my mind racing with guilt and anxiety, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
