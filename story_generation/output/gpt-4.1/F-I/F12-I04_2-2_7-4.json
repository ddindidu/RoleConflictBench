I knew something was wrong, and as his wife, I wanted to be there for him, to listen and share my own worries too. We\u2019d promised to always communicate openly, especially when things got tough. Just as I reached out to touch his hand and ask what was on his mind, my phone buzzed. It was my friend, panicked and breathless, saying she was already halfway to the airport but thought she\u2019d left her passport at home. She begged me to check and, if it was there, to bring it to her immediately\u2014her flight was in two hours, and she had no one else to call.\n\nI looked at my husband, his eyes finally meeting mine, silently asking for my attention. At the same time, my friend\u2019s desperate voice echoed in my mind. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me\u2014my husband needing my presence and understanding, my friend needing urgent help. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to do, caught between being the wife who listens and the friend who saves the day."}
