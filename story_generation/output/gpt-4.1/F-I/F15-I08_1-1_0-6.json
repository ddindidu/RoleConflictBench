My children would be finishing school in twenty minutes, and I\u2019d promised to pick them up today. It was important to them\u2014my youngest had been looking forward to telling me about her art project, and I knew how much it meant to be there, waiting at the gate. But I was still at the caf\u00e9, caught in a conversation with a group of acquaintances. The topic had shifted to a mutual colleague, and the tone was quickly turning sour. I could feel the expectation to join in, to nod along or add my own opinion, but I hated the idea of gossiping. I wanted to be someone who didn\u2019t speak ill of others, someone who set a good example. My phone buzzed with a reminder about school pick-up, and my heart pounded. If I left now, I\u2019d risk seeming rude or disinterested to the group. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late for my kids and might get drawn into saying something I\u2019d regret. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I sat there, torn, unsure which role to let down."}
