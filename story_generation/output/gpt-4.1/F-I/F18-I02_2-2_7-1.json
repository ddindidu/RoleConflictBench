My little brother, helmet slightly askew, eyed the steep, cracked ramp with a mix of excitement and nerves. He grinned at me, asking if I\u2019d film his new trick. I knew how much this meant to him, but I couldn\u2019t shake the worry gnawing at me\u2014one wrong move and he could get seriously hurt. At the same time, my phone vibrated again. It was my girlfriend, texting that she\u2019d had a terrible day at work. She needed me, wanted to talk, and I could almost hear the tears in her words. I felt pulled in two directions: my brother\u2019s hopeful eyes on me, trusting I\u2019d be there for him, and my girlfriend\u2019s need for comfort and reassurance. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be the supportive brother he needed and the caring boyfriend she deserved, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
