She was stuck on a project and needed my advice before her next meeting. I glanced across the table at my partner, who was waiting for me to continue our conversation about our mounting medical bills. We\u2019d promised to be honest and open, to face these challenges together, but my mind kept drifting to Jamie\u2019s question. She relied on me to share what I\u2019d learned, to help her grow, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. My partner\u2019s eyes searched mine, expecting my full attention, my trust. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in\u2014one needing my undivided honesty, the other my guidance and support. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where to focus, torn between the person I love and the person who looks up to me."}
