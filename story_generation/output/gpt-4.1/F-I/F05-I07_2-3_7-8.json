I could tell something was weighing on her, and I knew I should ask, should open the door for her to share. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014no bottling things up, always talk it through. But as I reached for her hand, my phone buzzed again. Another email from my manager, marked urgent. The leadership team needed my confirmation on a project detail for an external partner, and they were waiting on me to reply. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014my team expected quick responses, and any delay could hold up the whole process. My wife\u2019s voice was soft, almost hesitant, as she finally started to open up. I wanted to give her my full attention, to be the supportive husband she needed. But the phone kept buzzing, and I could almost hear my colleagues\u2019 impatience through the screen. My heart pounded as I sat there, torn between the person I loved and the team that depended on me, not sure which demand to answer first."}
