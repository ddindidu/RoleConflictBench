He asked about my day, his eyes warm and expectant. I knew he wanted more than just a summary\u2014he wanted me to share, to open up, to let him in. But my mind kept drifting to the stack of articles my mentor had suggested I read. They weren\u2019t due for weeks, but I felt the weight of her expectations pressing on me, the unspoken rule that a good mentee always goes the extra mile. I wanted to tell my husband about the pressure I felt, but I worried it would sound trivial, or worse, like I was making excuses for being distracted. I nodded along to his stories, feeling guilty for not being fully present, torn between the urge to be the attentive wife he deserved and the diligent mentee I aspired to be. The conversation moved on, but inside, I wrestled with the impossible choice: do I open up and risk sounding distant, or do I keep my worries to myself and focus on the tasks waiting for me upstairs?"}
