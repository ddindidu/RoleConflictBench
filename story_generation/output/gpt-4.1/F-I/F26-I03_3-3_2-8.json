Our argument from last night still hung heavy in the air, his words sharp and uncertain. He wanted to talk, to resolve things, to know if we could move forward. My heart ached with the pressure to fix what was broken between us, to be the understanding, patient girlfriend he needed right now. But just as I was about to call him, my granddaughter appeared in the doorway, her eyes red and voice trembling. She needed me\u2014her grandmother, her safe place\u2014to listen and offer advice about a problem she was facing at school, something that clearly weighed on her young shoulders. I could see the hope in her eyes, the expectation that I would have the wisdom to guide her. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to mend my relationship and the responsibility to be present for my granddaughter. Both needed me, both expected me to be strong and wise, but I could only be in one place at a time. My hands shook as I tried to decide who needed me more in this moment."}
