She wanted to know how to make friends, how to handle the pressure, and I felt the familiar tug to offer the comfort of my years, to assure her that things would work out, that she was strong enough. Just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from my mentee, apologizing for missing another deadline. I remembered our last conversation, how I\u2019d promised to help her develop better time management skills, to push her toward independence and accountability.\n\nI could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me. My granddaughter needed reassurance and gentle wisdom, a soft place to land. My mentee needed structure, honest feedback, and a nudge out of her comfort zone. I wanted to be the steady, loving grandparent, but also the mentor who didn\u2019t let things slide. My heart ached as I realized that the guidance I\u2019d give one might not serve the other. I sat there, torn, the expectations of both roles swirling inside me, unsure which voice to let speak first."}
