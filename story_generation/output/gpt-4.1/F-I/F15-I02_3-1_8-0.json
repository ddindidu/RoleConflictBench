The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy, unyielding weight. I needed to make sure we had enough\u2014no, more than enough\u2014so nothing would threaten our family\u2019s security. Every extra hour at work, every side gig, every dollar saved felt like a shield against uncertainty. \n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mia: \u201cRough day. Can we talk?\u201d I could picture her, shoulders tense, eyes tired. She always said my voice calmed her, that just listening helped.
