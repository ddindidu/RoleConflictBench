They looked at me, expecting my usual enthusiasm, and I tried to smile, but my mind was elsewhere. Just this morning, I\u2019d run into Mrs. Patel from down the hall in the lobby. She mentioned, with a tight smile, that some neighbors were upset about the noise from our apartment last Saturday. She wanted to talk it over, and I knew I\u2019d see her again soon. As a neighbor, I was supposed to be friendly, polite, and understanding, but as a sibling, I was expected to join in the fun, to laugh and play music with my family. The thought of disappointing my family or upsetting my neighbors twisted in my stomach. I could feel both sets of eyes\u2014my family\u2019s and my neighbors\u2019\u2014waiting for me to act, and I didn\u2019t know how to be the person both sides needed me to be."}
