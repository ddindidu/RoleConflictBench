My sister\u2019s text glared at me: \u201cCan we talk? I need you to listen, not judge.\u201d She\u2019d just made a decision I didn\u2019t agree with, but I knew she wanted patience, understanding\u2014mutual respect, even when we clashed. At the same time, my boyfriend\u2019s call came through. His voice was raw, trembling; he\u2019d lost his father last night. He needed me to be his anchor, to hold him up when he felt like falling apart. I could hear the pain in his silence, the expectation that I\u2019d be there, fully present, to support him.\n\nMy heart twisted. If I called my sister, I\u2019d risk seeming distant to my boyfriend when he needed me most. If I stayed with him, my sister might feel abandoned, her trust in our bond shaken. Both needed me, but in different ways\u2014one for patience and respect, the other for unwavering emotional support. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure how to be the sister and girlfriend they each deserved at the same time."}
