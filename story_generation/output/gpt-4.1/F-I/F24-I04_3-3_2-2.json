He\u2019d just found out his dad was moving away for good, and I knew he needed me. I sat on the edge of my bed, torn, when my phone buzzed. It was my best friend, Sam, calling. Her voice was shaky, barely holding together as she told me her grandmother had passed away. She needed me, too\u2014needed me to listen, to be there, to help her through the pain. I could hear my stepbrother\u2019s crying getting louder, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. I was supposed to be the one who held things together for my family, the one who was always there for my friends. But right now, I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart ached as I sat frozen, phone in hand, listening to Sam\u2019s sobs and my stepbrother\u2019s grief, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
