My heart pounded as I read the message: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted to meet with me this afternoon. As a mother, I felt a surge of shame and worry\u2014how could my child do this? I knew I needed to be there, to show him right from wrong, to support him and help him make amends. But just as I was about to call the school back, my mentee\u2019s email popped up. She was anxious, her big interview was tomorrow, and she needed my guidance now more than ever. As her mentor, I was supposed to be her anchor, helping her navigate this crucial moment in her career. I felt torn, pulled by the urgent needs of my child and the expectations of my mentee. My mind raced, guilt and responsibility battling inside me, as I tried to figure out how to be present for both of them when they needed me most."}
