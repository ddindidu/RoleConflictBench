As his step-sibling, I felt a knot in my stomach\u2014my mom\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cLook out for each other.\u201d Jamie\u2019s helmet was loose, and the ramp looked even rougher than usual after last night\u2019s rain. But as his mentor, I\u2019d promised him a session today to help him master the trick before his skate project deadline. He was counting on me to share what I knew, to encourage him to push his limits. \n\nHe looked at me, waiting for my nod, eager and trusting. I could see the excitement in his eyes, but also the risk. Should I stop him, insisting on safety, or let him try, guiding him through the steps as I\u2019d planned? My heart pounded as I weighed the responsibility of keeping him safe against the promise to help him grow. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding something different, and I stood there, torn, unable to move or speak."}
