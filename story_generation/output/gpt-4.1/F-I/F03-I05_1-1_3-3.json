My family gathered around, laughter echoing as we prepared for our annual tradition\u2014sharing stories from our heritage. My father looked at me expectantly, waiting for me to take my turn, to honor our roots as I always had. Just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Maya, the intern I\u2019d been mentoring at work. She was struggling with a project and needed advice before her deadline tonight.\n\nMy mother nudged me, reminding me to put my phone away and focus on the family. But Maya\u2019s message tugged at me; she depended on my guidance, and I\u2019d promised to help her grow. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family\u2019s hope that I\u2019d carry on our traditions, and Maya\u2019s trust in my support. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between honoring my family and being there for someone who needed me."}
