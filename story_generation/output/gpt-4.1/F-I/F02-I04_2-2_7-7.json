As a father, I knew my family depended on me to keep the lights on and food on the table. My wife had just mentioned we were running low on groceries, and the rent was due in a week. I needed to focus, to figure out how to stretch every dollar. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my friend, Mark. He\u2019d misunderstood a joke I\u2019d texted earlier, and his reply was curt, almost wounded. I could feel the weight of his disappointment through the screen. As his friend, I owed him an immediate call to clear things up, to make sure our years of trust weren\u2019t shaken by a careless word. But the clock was ticking, and every minute spent on the phone was a minute not spent solving my family\u2019s financial puzzle. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the urgent needs of my family and the fragile thread of my friendship."}
