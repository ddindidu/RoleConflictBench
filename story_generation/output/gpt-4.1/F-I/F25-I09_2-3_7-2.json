My stepdad was hunched over the kitchen table, rubbing his temples, while my mom barely looked up from her phone, her eyes rimmed with exhaustion. I knew they\u2019d been working extra shifts, and lately, the smallest things seemed to set them off. I wanted to sit with them, ask how they were, maybe make some tea\u2014just be there, like a good step-child should. But as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed: a message from the building group chat about the noise complaint. My heart sank. I remembered last night\u2019s laughter with friends, maybe a bit too loud. \n\nJust then, I had to head downstairs for the mail, and there was Mrs. Kim from 402, waiting in the lobby. She smiled tightly, clearly expecting a polite greeting, maybe even an apology. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my parents needing comfort upstairs, my neighbor expecting courtesy and accountability right here. My mind raced, torn between the urge to rush back to my family and the need to handle this neighborly encounter with grace."}
