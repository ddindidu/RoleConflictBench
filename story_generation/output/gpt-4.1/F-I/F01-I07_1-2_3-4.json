My daughter had reminded me twice already: \u201cDad, don\u2019t forget, everyone\u2019s coming over. The kids are so excited to see you.\u201d I could almost hear my grandson\u2019s laughter, feel his small hand tugging at mine, begging me to play. But as I scrolled through my emails, a new message from my colleague popped up\u2014another reminder that the report I was working on needed to be finished by Monday morning. If I didn\u2019t get it done, the whole project would stall, and my teammate would be left scrambling. I could sense the unspoken pressure from my team, the expectation that I\u2019d pull my weight, just as I always had. My chest tightened as I imagined disappointing my family or letting down my colleagues. I wanted to be present for my grandchildren, to be the reliable grandfather they looked forward to seeing. But I also didn\u2019t want to be the weak link at work. The two worlds pulled at me, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
