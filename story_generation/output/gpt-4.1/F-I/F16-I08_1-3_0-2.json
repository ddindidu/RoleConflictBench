As we sat down, my partner sighed and mentioned how work had been a bit overwhelming\u2014nothing major, but enough to leave them feeling drained. I reached for their hand, ready to listen and offer comfort, knowing how much they value my support after a long day. Just as I was about to ask more, I noticed an acquaintance from my book club at a nearby table, tears streaming down her face. She caught my eye, and I could see she wanted someone to talk to. I felt the weight of her expectation\u2014she always said I was easy to talk to, and now she needed that from me. My partner looked at me, waiting for my attention, while my acquaintance\u2019s silent plea tugged at me. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure how to be there for both without letting either down."}
