My daughter had gathered the whole family for dinner, hinting at some big news she wanted to share. As a grandparent, I knew how much these moments meant\u2014being present, listening, celebrating together. I could already picture my granddaughter\u2019s eager face, waiting for my reaction. Just as I was about to leave, my phone buzzed. It was my oldest friend, voice trembling, stranded on the highway with a broken-down car. She needed me\u2014right now. I could hear the fear in her words, the loneliness of the dark road pressing in on her. My heart twisted. My family expected me to be there, to share in their joy, but my friend was counting on me in her hour of need. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the warmth of my family\u2019s laughter and the urgent plea of a friend in distress, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me."}
