Inside, my family was gathered around the table, laughing and sharing stories, expecting me to join in and show that I belonged, that I respected their traditions. I wanted to fit in, to prove I cared about these rituals, even if they still felt foreign to me.\n\nJust as I was about to step back into the living room, I heard footsteps in the corridor. Mrs. Lee, our neighbor, appeared with her arms full of groceries. She smiled warmly, expecting the usual friendly greeting. I knew she valued these small exchanges, the polite hellos that made our building feel like a community.\n\nBut I hesitated, torn between the family waiting for me to uphold their traditions and the neighbor expecting a moment of kindness. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
