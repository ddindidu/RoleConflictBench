The home loan repayment loomed over me like a storm cloud, and I knew I had to double-check every expense, every cent, to make sure we\u2019d be ready in two months. My mind raced with numbers and deadlines, the weight of my family\u2019s security pressing on my shoulders. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my friend, her words sharp and distant. She\u2019d misunderstood my last text, and now she sounded hurt. I could almost hear her voice trembling. I knew I should call her right away, explain, and clear the air\u2014she expected honesty and openness from me, and I valued our friendship deeply. But the clock was ticking, and every minute spent on the phone was a minute stolen from the careful planning my family needed. My heart twisted, torn between the urgent needs of my home and the fragile trust of my friend, both demanding my attention, both impossible to ignore."}
