It was Jamie, someone I\u2019d met through a mutual friend a few months ago. We weren\u2019t close, but we\u2019d chatted enough for them to have my number.

I could almost hear my mom\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me how important it was to be at family dinners, especially since my sister was coming home from college. My family expected me to show up, to be present, to laugh and share stories. But Jamie\u2019s message tugged at me too\u2014what kind of person would I be if I ignored someone in need?
