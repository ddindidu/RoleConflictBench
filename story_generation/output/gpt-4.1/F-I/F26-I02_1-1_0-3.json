Just then, my grandson wandered in, his face a mix of excitement and uncertainty. \u201cGrandpa, can I ask you something? I\u2019m starting high school next week, and I don\u2019t know what to expect. How did you handle big changes when you were my age?\u201d His eyes searched mine, hoping for reassurance and wisdom.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My girlfriend wanted my undivided attention, a night where I could be present and loving, not distracted by anything else. My grandson needed me to be the steady guide, to share stories and advice that might help him find his footing. Both deserved my best, but I could already sense the evenings slipping away, the calendar filling up. My heart tugged in two directions, torn between being the wise grandparent and the attentive boyfriend, unsure how to give each the time and care they needed."}
