My daughter had just started her new job, and the family group chat was alive with congratulations and questions. As a grandmother, I felt the pull to join in, to show my support, to keep the family close and let my daughter know how proud I was. But my boyfriend was in the living room, waiting for me to come back. We\u2019d argued again this morning about money\u2014how we spend it, how we save it, how we never seem to agree. He wanted to talk, to resolve things before the tension grew any thicker between us. I could hear the expectation in his voice, the need for reassurance and understanding. My heart tugged in two directions: toward my family, who needed my warmth and encouragement, and toward my boyfriend, who needed my attention and willingness to work things out. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which demand to answer first."}
