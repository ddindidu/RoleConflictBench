She wanted to talk, to explain how she felt misunderstood and hurt by my offhand comment. I knew I needed to be patient, to listen and show her that I respected her feelings, even if we saw things differently. But just as she started to open up, my phone buzzed with a message from my best friend. She\u2019d misread the tone of my last text and now thought I was angry with her. Her reply was short and wounded, and I could tell she needed me to call her right away to clear things up. I felt torn\u2014my sister\u2019s eyes were searching mine, waiting for me to be the understanding sibling she needed, while my friend was expecting me to reach out and fix our misunderstanding before it grew. My heart pounded as I sat between them, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which role to answer first."}
