I knew he expected me to be open, to share honestly, but my mind was tangled elsewhere. My boyfriend and I had argued again this morning\u2014our third fight this week, all about money and how we never seemed to have enough. He wanted me to talk things through, to resolve the tension between us, but I felt drained, caught between wanting to fix things with him and needing to be present with my husband. I nodded and gave my husband a vague answer, feeling guilty for holding back. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from my boyfriend, asking if we could talk tonight and sort things out. My chest tightened. I wanted to be the wife who communicated openly, but I also needed to be the girlfriend who didn\u2019t run from conflict. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I didn\u2019t know which part of myself to answer first."}
