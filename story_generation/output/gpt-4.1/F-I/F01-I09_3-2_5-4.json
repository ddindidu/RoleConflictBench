Something serious had happened, and she needed me at her house right away. As a grandfather, I knew my family expected me to be there, to offer comfort and guidance. I grabbed my coat, but as I opened the door, my dog, Max, darted out and started barking loudly in the hallway. I could hear my neighbor\u2019s door creak open, and I remembered the polite but firm conversation we\u2019d had last week about keeping the noise down, especially near the shared entrance. I felt the weight of their expectation too\u2014to be a considerate neighbor, to keep the peace in our building. My heart pounded as I tried to calm Max, torn between rushing to my family and respecting my neighbor\u2019s need for quiet. The hallway echoed with Max\u2019s barks and my own anxious thoughts, caught between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
