It was my mom, calling for our usual Sunday chat. I could almost hear her gentle voice, asking about my week, wanting to know if I was eating well, if I was happy. I knew how much these calls meant to her, and to me too\u2014they were our way of staying close, even with miles between us. But today, my mentor had squeezed me into her tight schedule for a quick check-in. She\u2019d made it clear how valuable her time was, and I didn\u2019t want to seem ungrateful or unprofessional by being late or distracted. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between answering my mom and respecting my mentor\u2019s time. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing on me, each important in its own way, and I wished I could be in two places at once."}
