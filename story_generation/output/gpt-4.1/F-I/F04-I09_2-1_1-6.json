Her voice trembled\u2014she\u2019d just had a rough argument with her boss and needed someone to talk to. As her brother, I knew she counted on me to listen, to be there for her when things got tough. I promised I\u2019d call her back in a few minutes, just as the doorbell rang. It was my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, looking anxious. She explained she was expecting an important package today, but had to rush out for an emergency. She asked if I could keep an eye out and sign for it if it arrived.\n\nI nodded, but inside, I felt the pressure mounting. My sister needed my full attention and support, but Mrs. Lee was counting on me too. If I got caught up on the phone, I might miss the delivery, and she\u2019d be disappointed. If I focused on the door, I might not be the brother my sister needed right now. I stood in my hallway, phone in hand, heart pounding, torn between being the supportive brother and the reliable neighbor, unsure which role to put first."}
