I remembered how Mom always said we should include each other, and I wanted him to feel like he belonged. But just as I was about to answer, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my friend, Sarah: \u201cHey, are we meeting at the mall or the theater? I\u2019m confused.\u201d She\u2019d been upset with me last week for not communicating clearly, and I knew she expected me to be more open and responsive this time.\n\nI felt torn. If I took a minute to explain things to Sarah, my brother might feel ignored or unwanted, like I was brushing him off. But if I focused on my brother, Sarah might get frustrated again, thinking I didn\u2019t care about her feelings or our plans. Both of them were counting on me in different ways, and I could feel the pressure building in my chest as I stood there, phone in hand, caught between being a good brother and a good friend."}
