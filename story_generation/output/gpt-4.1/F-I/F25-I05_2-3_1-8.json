It\u2019s our ritual\u2014he expects to hear about my week, and I know he waits for my questions about his garden and health. Tonight, though, my phone buzzes with a desperate message from Maya, my mentee. Her big presentation is tomorrow, and she\u2019s panicking, asking if I can review her slides and talk her through her pitch. I glance at the clock. If I help Maya now, I\u2019ll miss my usual call with my stepdad, and he\u2019ll worry, maybe even feel forgotten. But if I call him first, I\u2019ll lose the window to help Maya when she needs me most. My chest tightens as I picture my stepdad\u2019s disappointment and Maya\u2019s anxiety. Both count on me, but in such different ways. I pace the room, phone in hand, torn between the comfort of family connection and the responsibility to guide someone who\u2019s counting on me for her future."}
