My mother called from the living room, reminding me to rehearse my lines for the family ceremony tonight. As the eldest son, everyone expected me to lead the prayers and rituals, just as my father had done for years. It was important to my family, a way to honor our heritage and keep our traditions alive. But as I glanced at the cake, I remembered my promise to myself: to be a good neighbor in this new place, to introduce myself and share a bit of kindness. I saw the lights on next door and knew this was the perfect moment. Yet, if I left now, I\u2019d miss the final preparations for the ceremony, disappointing my parents and risking mistakes in front of my relatives. My heart pounded as I weighed the warmth of a neighborly gesture against the heavy responsibility of family tradition, feeling pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
