Every surface needed to shine, and the guest room had to be perfect. I promised I\u2019d help with the chores after work, but as I stepped into the lobby, I ran into Mrs. Lee, our neighbor from down the hall. She looked tense, and I remembered the noise complaint that had been circulating. She greeted me, her tone polite but pointed, and I knew she expected a friendly, neighborly conversation\u2014maybe even an apology or explanation. I felt the pressure mounting: my spouse was counting on me to get home quickly and help, but Mrs. Lee clearly wanted to talk, and I didn\u2019t want to seem rude or dismissive. My mind raced, torn between the demands of being a supportive partner and a considerate neighbor, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
