My husband paced the living room, his brow furrowed, voice trembling as he described the impossible choice his boss had given him. He needed me\u2014needed my reassurance, my advice, the comfort only I could give. I wanted to be present, to listen, to help him untangle his thoughts. But my eyes kept darting to the clock. My mentor\u2019s office hours were starting in ten minutes, and she\u2019d made it clear how important it was to respect her time. She was busy, and these windows were rare. Missing them meant waiting another week, maybe longer, to get her guidance on my project. I felt my chest tighten, torn between the urge to hold my husband\u2019s hand and the pressure to prove myself a dedicated mentee. Both needed me, right now, in different ways. My heart ached as I tried to decide where I belonged in this moment, feeling the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
