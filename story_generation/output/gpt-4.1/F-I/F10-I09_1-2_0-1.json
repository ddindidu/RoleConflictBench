She\u2019s sent a message: \u201cHow\u2019s your weekend, sweetie?\u201d I know she expects a real conversation, not just a quick \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I start typing, then stop, feeling guilty for not calling her last night like I promised. Just as I\u2019m about to reply, I hear voices in the hallway\u2014my new neighbors. I remember the little cake I baked, hoping to make a good impression. I grab it and head to the door, heart pounding. I want to be the friendly neighbor everyone likes, but my phone buzzes again\u2014Mom, asking if I\u2019m okay. I hesitate, torn between stepping out to greet the neighbors and sitting down to call my mom. Both expect me to be present, to show I care. I stand in the doorway, cake in one hand, phone in the other, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which to choose first."}
