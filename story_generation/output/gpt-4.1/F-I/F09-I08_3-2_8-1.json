The laughter and chatter around me felt distant, muffled by the weight of the home loan repayment looming in two months. As a mother, I knew I had to ensure our family\u2019s financial stability, and every day felt like a countdown. I was already planning extra shifts, cutting expenses, and searching for ways to stretch every dollar.\n\nJust then, I noticed a new face in the group\u2014a young woman, fidgeting with her cup, eyes darting nervously. As an acquaintance, I was expected to be warm and welcoming, to help her feel at ease. People glanced at me, silently urging me to start a conversation, to bridge the gap. But my thoughts kept drifting back to the bills, the budget spreadsheet waiting at home, the fear of falling short. I felt torn, my heart pulled between the need to be present and kind in this moment, and the relentless anxiety gnawing at me from within."}
