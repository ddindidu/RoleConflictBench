It\u2019s our ritual\u2014me sitting on the edge of my bed, phone pressed to my ear, listening to my mother\u2019s gentle questions and my father\u2019s quiet laughter. They expect these calls, and I know how much they mean to them. Tonight, as I walk down the nearly empty hallway at work, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s my parents, right on time. I\u2019m about to answer when I spot Jamie, an acquaintance from another department, coming toward me. We don\u2019t know each other well, but there\u2019s an unspoken rule to smile, maybe exchange a few words, to keep things friendly. My parents are waiting, but Jamie is almost here, and I can\u2019t ignore them without seeming cold. My heart pounds as I weigh the warmth my parents expect against the easygoing friendliness Jamie expects. I feel caught, wishing I could split myself in two, but knowing I can\u2019t."}
