Miss you!\u201d I knew she expected me to check in, maybe call and chat for a while. I hadn\u2019t spoken to my parents all week, and guilt pricked at me. I started typing a reply, promising myself I\u2019d call after dinner. Just then, another call came in\u2014this time from Mark, an acquaintance from work. His voice was tense, almost desperate. \u201cHey, sorry to bother you, but my car broke down on Maple Road. I don\u2019t know who else to call. Can you help?\u201d I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both expectations. My parents wanted to hear from me, to know I was okay and cared. Mark needed someone right now, stranded and anxious. My mind raced, torn between being the reliable son my parents hoped for and the helpful acquaintance Mark needed. I stared at my phone, heart pounding, caught between two worlds and unsure which to choose."}
