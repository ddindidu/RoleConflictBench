She told me about her fears of growing old alone, her voice breaking as she admitted how lost she felt since Dad\u2019s health started declining. I could hear the hope in her words, the way she needed me to reassure her, to be the strong one for once. My heart ached for her, and I wanted nothing more than to wrap her in comfort, to promise her everything would be okay.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a new message\u2014my boyfriend, still angry from our fight earlier, asking if I was going to talk things through or just ignore him. The argument had left us both raw, and I knew he was waiting for me to reach out, to fix what was broken between us. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of my parents\u2019 pain on one side and the fear of losing my relationship on the other. My chest tightened as I tried to decide who needed me more, feeling like I was failing both."}
