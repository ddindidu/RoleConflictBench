I can see the disappointment in her eyes, the way she keeps glancing at her phone, hoping for a different message. I want to be there for her, to listen and reassure her that she\u2019s more than her job. But just as I reach for her hand, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from Mom: \u201cHaven\u2019t heard from you this week. Everything okay?\u201d I know she worries if I don\u2019t check in, and I promised I\u2019d be better about keeping in touch. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in on me: Maya needs my full attention right now, but so does my mom, in her own way. My thumb hovers over my phone, torn between sending a quick reply to Mom or putting it away to focus on Maya. My heart aches, caught between wanting to be a good son and a supportive boyfriend, knowing that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
