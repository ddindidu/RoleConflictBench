Every year, we all came together to cook, share stories, and honor the customs passed down through generations. My parents expected me to be there, to help set the table, join in the rituals, and show respect for our heritage. As I was helping my mom prepare the special dishes, my phone buzzed. It was Sam, an acquaintance from work. He sounded desperate\u2014his moving help had canceled last minute, and he needed someone to help carry boxes to his new apartment. He didn\u2019t have anyone else to call. I could hear the stress in his voice, and I knew he was counting on me. I felt torn. My family would be disappointed if I left, but Sam genuinely needed my help. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood in the kitchen, phone in hand, heart pounding, unsure which role I should honor."}
