Just us.\u201d My heart fluttered, knowing we only had this one evening before I\u2019d be away for work. I wanted to make it special, to be present, to laugh and hold hands and forget the world for a while. But across from me, my husband stared into his coffee, shoulders tense, eyes distant. I knew that look\u2014something was weighing on him. He needed me to ask, to listen, to be the partner who shares burdens and offers comfort. I felt the pull in both directions: the promise of a carefree night with my boyfriend, the responsibility to be open and supportive with my husband. My mind raced with guilt and longing, torn between the warmth of intimacy and the duty of honesty. The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which part of myself to honor tonight."}
