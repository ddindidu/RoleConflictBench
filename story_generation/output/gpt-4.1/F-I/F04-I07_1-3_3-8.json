My younger sister looked at me, eyes bright, asking if I\u2019d join them for a hike on Saturday. My parents chimed in, hoping I\u2019d be there too. I wanted to be present, to laugh and plan with them, but my mind kept drifting to the unread email notification on my phone. At work, leadership was waiting for my prompt reply to confirm details for an important external partner. I knew they expected me to be responsive, especially with deadlines looming. My brotherly role pulled me to put the phone away and focus on my family, but the colleague in me felt the pressure to respond quickly and not let the team down. My heart pounded as I tried to listen to my family\u2019s plans, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
