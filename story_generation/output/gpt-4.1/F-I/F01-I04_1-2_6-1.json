My daughter\u2019s message glowed on the screen: \u201cDad, can you help organize the family dinner this weekend? Everyone\u2019s looking forward to catching up.\u201d I knew how much these holidays meant\u2014my grandkids would expect my stories, my son would want to talk about work, and my daughter would need my help in the kitchen. I started typing a reply, promising to call her soon, when my phone rang. It was Tom, my oldest friend. His voice trembled, \u201cDo you have a minute? I really need to talk. Things are rough with Linda.\u201d I could hear the pain in his words, the kind that only a friend could help carry. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014my family expecting my presence and planning, Tom needing my ear and comfort. I stared at the phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to answer first."}
