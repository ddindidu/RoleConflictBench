Mom wanted everyone there, and my sister had made it clear that my absence would be noticed. I could almost hear her voice, \u201cIt\u2019s important to be together, especially now.\u201d The pressure to show up, to be present, weighed on me. As I rounded the corner, I spotted Jamie, an acquaintance from my building, walking toward me. The hallway was silent, and I knew the polite thing would be to smile, maybe even stop for a quick chat. Jamie always expected a friendly word, and I didn\u2019t want to seem cold or distant. But my mind was elsewhere, torn between the obligation to my family and the social expectation to be warm and approachable. I felt my heart race, caught between the urge to rush past and the need to maintain a friendly connection. The hallway seemed to stretch, and I could feel the tension building inside me as I tried to decide what to do next."}
