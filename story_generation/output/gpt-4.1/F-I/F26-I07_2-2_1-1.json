My phone buzzed with a reminder, and I glanced at the agenda\u2014today\u2019s updates were crucial, and I knew my input was expected. Just then, my granddaughter shuffled into the room, her eyes downcast, shoulders slumped. I recognized that look; she needed someone to talk to, someone to listen and offer the kind of guidance only a grandparent could give. My heart ached to reach out, to share a story from my own life that might help her find her way. But the meeting was about to start, and my colleagues were counting on me to be present and engaged. I felt torn, caught between the silent plea in my granddaughter\u2019s eyes and the professional responsibility waiting on the screen. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I sat frozen, wrestling with which part of myself to honor in that moment."}
