The school bell would ring in fifteen minutes, and my kids would be waiting at the gate, scanning the crowd for my face. I promised them I\u2019d be there today, just like I promised last week when I missed it because of work. My phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: \u201cTeam Meeting\u20143:00 p.m.\u201d I could already picture my colleagues\u2019 faces in the little video boxes, expecting me to chime in with updates and ideas. It was just a routine catch-up, and I knew it would be recorded, but I also knew how much my manager valued participation, how she always said, \u201cIt\u2019s important to be present, even for the small things.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my children\u2019s hopeful eyes, my team\u2019s silent expectations. My mind raced, torn between the school gate and the meeting link, wishing I could split myself in two."}
