She\u2019d just gotten her first job offer, and tonight we were supposed to celebrate with the whole family. I could already picture her smile when she saw the cake I\u2019d ordered. Just as I finished tying the ribbon, my phone buzzed. It was Mia, my closest friend. \u201cUgh, today was the worst. Can I call you? I really need to vent,\u201d her message read. I glanced at the clock\u2014only half an hour until my sister\u2019s dinner. I knew how much it meant to her that I\u2019d be there, cheering her on, but I also knew Mia had been having a tough week. She always listened to me when I needed it, and I wanted to be there for her too. My heart twisted as I stared at the phone, torn between the sister who counted on my support and the friend who needed my ear."}
