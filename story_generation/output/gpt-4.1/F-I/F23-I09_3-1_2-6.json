My stepson, Ethan, had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted me to come in and discuss it this afternoon. As a step-parent, I knew how important it was to show up for Ethan, to be present at school events and, especially now, to help him face the consequences of his actions. I wanted to support him, to show him I cared, even if it meant having a difficult conversation.\n\nBut just as I was about to call the school, my neighbor, Mrs. Lee, texted. She was expecting an important package today and asked if I could receive it for her, since she\u2019d be at work. She\u2019d done the same for me countless times, and I knew how much she relied on our little system of mutual help. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure build. Both roles demanded my presence this afternoon, and I could already feel the tension rising in my chest as I tried to figure out how to be the step-parent Ethan needed and the neighbor Mrs. Lee counted on."}
