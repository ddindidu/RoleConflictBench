I reminded her, gently but firmly, that part of being respectful is keeping our things in their place. She nodded, gathering her things, but then the doorbell rang. It was Mrs. Lee from next door, reminding me about the HOA inspection this afternoon. She looked pointedly at the corridor, where a few of my daughter\u2019s things still lingered. I felt a flush of embarrassment. As a neighbor, I\u2019m expected to keep the shared space clear and safe, especially with the inspection looming. But as a mother, I want my daughter to learn to take responsibility herself, not just have me swoop in and fix things for her. I could quickly tidy up to avoid trouble with the HOA and Mrs. Lee, or I could insist my daughter do it herself, risking a citation and my neighbors\u2019 annoyance. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling torn between teaching my child and keeping the peace in our building."}
