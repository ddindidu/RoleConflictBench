He sounded upset, saying he\u2019d just been rejected from his dream internship. I could hear the frustration in his voice when he called, and as his sister, my instinct was to comfort him, to tell him it would all be okay and that he was amazing no matter what. But as his mentor\u2014something I\u2019d become since he started asking me about career paths\u2014I felt the pressure to give him practical advice, to help him see what he could do differently next time.\n\nHe wanted me to listen, to be on his side, but I also knew he was looking for answers. I could sense his disappointment, and I wanted to protect him from it, but I also wanted to push him to learn from the experience. The expectations tugged at me: be the supportive sister, be the honest mentor. My heart ached as I tried to find the right words, torn between soothing him and challenging him, knowing that whatever I said next would shape how he saw both me and himself."}
