My stepbrother\u2019s eyes lit up, and my mom smiled, nudging me to join in the excitement. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun, right?\u201d she said, and I nodded, feeling the weight of their expectation. They wanted me to be part of the family, to show I cared about these new bonds we were building. But in my pocket, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from my mentor about the code sample I needed to finish before our next meeting. The assignment was tough, and I knew I\u2019d need most of the weekend to get it right. My mentor always said, \u201cShow me you\u2019re committed,\u201d and I wanted to prove I was serious about learning. As my family looked at me, waiting for my answer, I felt torn. If I said yes to the hike, I\u2019d disappoint my mentor and risk falling behind. If I said no, I\u2019d let down my family, who just wanted me to belong. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out what to do, caught between two worlds that both mattered to me."}
