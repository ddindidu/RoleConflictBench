We\u2019d planned this day for weeks\u2014just the two of us, no interruptions. But as we waited for our coffee, I spotted my stepbrother, Ethan, across the street. He was fiddling with his phone, headphones in, and started to step off the curb, oblivious to the car speeding toward him. My heart lurched. I knew Mom always counted on me to look out for him, especially since Dad remarried. But Mia squeezed my hand, her eyes searching mine, wanting me to stay, to be present, to make this moment count. I felt torn in two\u2014my responsibility to Ethan pulling me one way, my promise to Mia tugging the other. My mind raced, guilt and panic colliding, as I stood frozen between the two people who needed me most."}
