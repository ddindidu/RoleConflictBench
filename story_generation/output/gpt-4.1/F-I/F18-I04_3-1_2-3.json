I really need to talk.\u201d He\u2019d just found out he didn\u2019t get into his dream college, and I could hear the heaviness in his voice when we spoke earlier. As his sibling, I knew he needed me to listen, to reassure him, to just be there. I was already grabbing my keys when my phone lit up again\u2014this time, it was my friend, Jamie. \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m losing my mind with these furniture instructions and I need help before I break something.\u201d Jamie had just moved into a new apartment and didn\u2019t know anyone else in town. I\u2019d promised I\u2019d be there for her, especially since she\u2019d helped me so much last year. I stood in the hallway, torn. My brother\u2019s pain felt urgent, but so did Jamie\u2019s need for support. Both were counting on me, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides, my heart racing as I tried to figure out who needed me more."}
