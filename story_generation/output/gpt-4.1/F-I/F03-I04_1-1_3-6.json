The holiday candles flickered, and my parents began the traditional blessing, expecting everyone to be fully present, phones away, eyes closed in respect. I knew how much these moments meant to them\u2014how they believed upholding our traditions kept us close. But as I bowed my head, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was my friend, texting in confusion about where we were supposed to meet later. We\u2019d had a misunderstanding earlier, and I\u2019d promised to clear things up. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: my family\u2019s silent expectation that I honor this ritual, and my friend\u2019s need for reassurance and clarity. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to sneak a quick reply, knowing it would break the unspoken family rule, but also knowing my friend was waiting, probably anxious. The pressure built inside me, torn between being the son my parents wanted and the friend I promised to be."}
