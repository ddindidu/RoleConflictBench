He grinned at me, eyes shining with excitement, and I felt a knot form in my stomach. As his step-sibling, I knew I was supposed to look out for him, make sure he didn\u2019t do anything too reckless. But he was determined to try this new trick, and I could see he wouldn\u2019t listen to warnings easily.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the code sample my mentor assigned was still unfinished. I had barely started, and the deadline was creeping closer. My mentor expected me to be responsible, to show progress and commitment. I could almost hear her voice in my head, urging me to focus and not let distractions get in the way.\n\nMax called out, asking if I\u2019d watch him, maybe even film the attempt. I hesitated, torn between staying to keep him safe and rushing inside to work on my assignment. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, unsure which role I was supposed to choose."}
