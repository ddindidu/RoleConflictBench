He\u2019d been caught bullying a classmate, and the principal wanted to meet with me this afternoon. My heart pounded with worry and guilt\u2014was I failing him as a step-parent? I knew I needed to be there, to show him that I cared and to help him understand the seriousness of his actions. But as I glanced at my computer screen, the unfinished report glared back at me. The deadline was today, and my part was crucial for the next phase of the project. If I left now, my colleague would be stuck waiting, and the whole team\u2019s timeline would unravel. I could already imagine the disappointment in their voices, the subtle frustration in tomorrow\u2019s meeting. Torn between my responsibility to my family and my commitment to my team, I felt the pressure mounting, my mind racing through possible excuses and solutions, but none seemed right."}
