His voice trembled as he explained his car had broken down on the highway, and he was stranded in the dark. He needed me to come get him right away. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders. I knew my parents expected me to check in with them, especially on weekends, just to let them know I was safe. I hadn\u2019t texted them yet tonight, and I could already imagine my mom\u2019s worried face if she woke up and saw no message from me. But Sam was my closest friend, and he\u2019d always been there for me in tough times. He was counting on me now, and I couldn\u2019t ignore his call for help. My mind raced, torn between the urge to reassure my parents and the need to rush out the door for Sam. The pressure from both sides squeezed at my chest, and I stood frozen, phone in hand, caught between being a good son and a loyal friend."}
