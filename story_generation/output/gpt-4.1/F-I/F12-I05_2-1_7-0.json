He stared at his coffee, brow furrowed, and I knew something was wrong. As his wife, I felt the urge to reach out, to ask him what was weighing on his mind, to share my own worries from work and invite him to do the same. We\u2019d promised to always communicate openly, to never let things fester. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Maya, my mentee at work. She was anxious about a job offer and wanted my advice, just a quick call, she said. I glanced at my husband, then at my phone. Both needed me in different ways: one expected my openness and vulnerability, the other my calm guidance and support. My heart twisted as I tried to decide who needed me more in that moment, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding a part of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
