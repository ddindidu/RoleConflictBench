My wife was in the living room, her eyes red from crying, her world unraveling after the news about her father\u2019s health. She needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words to anchor her. But my phone kept lighting up with messages from my girlfriend, who just got a scathing review from her boss. She was devastated, reaching out for comfort, asking if I could come over or at least talk for a while.\n\nI felt split in two. My wife\u2019s pain was raw and immediate, and I knew she expected me to be her rock, to stay by her side tonight. But my girlfriend\u2019s voice in my ear, trembling and small, made my heart ache. She needed me too, needed to know she wasn\u2019t alone in her disappointment. Both of them expected my full attention, my empathy, my presence. I stared at the wall, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me, wondering how I could possibly be enough for both of them at the same time."}
