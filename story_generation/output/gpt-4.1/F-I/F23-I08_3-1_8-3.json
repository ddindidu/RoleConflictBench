As a step-parent, I felt the pressure to keep everything afloat, to make sure my partner and stepchild never felt the sting of financial instability. Every dollar counted, and I was already calculating what we could cut back on to make the next payment. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mark, an old acquaintance from work. \u201cHey, I\u2019m in your neighborhood tonight. Any chance you could recommend a good restaurant? Maybe even join me for dinner?\u201d \n\nI knew Mark was going through a rough patch and probably needed someone to talk to. As an acquaintance, I felt obligated to be supportive, to offer my time and a listening ear. But the thought of spending money on dinner, even just for myself, made my stomach twist. I wanted to help, but I also needed to protect my family\u2019s finances. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I sat there, phone in hand, torn between being the reliable step-parent and the supportive acquaintance, unsure which role to answer first."}
