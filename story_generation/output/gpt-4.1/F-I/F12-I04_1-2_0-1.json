He didn\u2019t seem too upset, but I knew he appreciated it when I listened and offered a few words of comfort. I reached for his hand, ready to be present for him, when my phone buzzed. It was my friend, calling unexpectedly. I answered, and immediately heard the strain in her voice\u2014she was on the verge of tears, desperate to talk about a heated argument she\u2019d just had with her partner. She asked if I had a moment, her voice trembling. I glanced at my husband, who was waiting for my response, hoping for my attention after his long day. My friend needed me, truly needed me, but so did he, in his quieter way. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, the weight of both their expectations pressing down on me as I tried to decide who needed my support more in that moment."}
