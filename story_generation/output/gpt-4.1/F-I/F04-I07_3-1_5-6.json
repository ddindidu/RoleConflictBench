My sister\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe really want you there this year. It won\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, too, reminding me how important these moments are. At the same time, my work phone buzzed with a new email from a colleague. The subject line read, \u201cFYI\u2014No action needed now, but please confirm you\u2019ve seen this.\u201d I knew the expectation: even if it wasn\u2019t urgent, I was supposed to acknowledge messages quickly, to show I was engaged and reliable.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting. My family wanted my full attention, to be present and involved, not distracted by work. But my team at the office expected me to stay connected, even during off-hours, to keep the workflow smooth. I could feel the tension in my chest, torn between being the dependable brother everyone counted on and the responsive colleague my team relied upon. I sat there, phone in hand, wrestling with which role to answer first, knowing that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
