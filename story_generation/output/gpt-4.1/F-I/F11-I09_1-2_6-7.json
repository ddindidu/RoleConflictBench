The weather app warned of heavy rain and possible power outages tonight. My sister and I had been working on including each other more in our social lives, and I knew she\u2019d be happy to come along. She\u2019d mentioned feeling left out lately, and I wanted to show her she mattered.\n\nBut then I remembered Mrs. Kim, my elderly neighbor down the hall. She lived alone, and last time there was a storm, she\u2019d been anxious and called me for help when her lights flickered. I knew she\u2019d appreciate someone checking in, maybe even staying nearby in case things got bad.
