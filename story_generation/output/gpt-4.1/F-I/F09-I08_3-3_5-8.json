As a mother, I knew I had to teach him right from wrong, to make him apologize and understand the seriousness of stealing. My heart ached, torn between anger and the urge to protect him from shame. Just as I was gathering my thoughts, my phone buzzed. It was Lisa, an acquaintance from the neighborhood, her voice low and urgent. She\u2019d heard something troubling about another mom at school\u2014something that, if repeated, could ruin her reputation. Lisa wanted to know if I\u2019d heard anything, pressing me for details. I felt the weight of another expectation: not to gossip, not to spread harm. My mind raced, caught between the need to discipline my son with honesty and compassion, and the pressure to respond to Lisa without betraying another\u2019s trust or fueling rumors. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I could feel my chest tighten as I struggled to find the right words, knowing that whatever I chose would mean letting someone down."}
