Let us know how you\u2019re doing.\u201d I know she worries if I don\u2019t check in, so I start typing a quick reply. Just then, my girlfriend, Emma, walks in, her face tense. \u201cCan we talk about what happened with the dinner plans?\u201d she asks, her voice tight. I remember the mix-up\u2014she thought I\u2019d canceled on her parents, but I\u2019d just forgotten to confirm. She\u2019s clearly upset, and I know she expects me to talk it through and make things right. My phone vibrates again\u2014another message from my mom, this time asking if I\u2019m eating well. I feel pulled in two directions: my parents want reassurance that I\u2019m okay, but Emma needs my full attention to resolve our misunderstanding. My thumbs hover over my phone, my mind racing, heart pounding, as I try to figure out who needs me more in this moment."}
