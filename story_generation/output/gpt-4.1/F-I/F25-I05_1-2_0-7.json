Let\u2019s catch up soon?\u201d I know he expects me to check in, to keep the connection alive, especially since Mom passed. I type a quick reply, but my mind is elsewhere. My mentee, Jordan, is waiting for our video call. He\u2019s up for a big promotion, and he\u2019s counting on me to help him prep for the interview. I promised I\u2019d review his presentation and give feedback, but I can feel the weight of my stepdad\u2019s loneliness through the screen. I want to be present for both\u2014be the supportive step-child who doesn\u2019t let the family drift apart, and the mentor who pushes Jordan to reach his potential. But as I stare at my phone, torn between dialing my stepdad or logging into the call with Jordan, I feel the tension knotting in my chest. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and I know someone will be disappointed."}
