I knew I should call him back, remind him about respecting public spaces and behaving properly\u2014wasn\u2019t that what a good step-parent did? I could almost hear my partner\u2019s voice in my head, urging me to set boundaries and teach him right from wrong. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed with a message from my mentor, asking if I had any questions about the new project. I did have a small question about a term she\u2019d used, but it felt trivial, not worth interrupting her day. Still, she\u2019d told me to communicate any concerns, no matter how minor. I stood there, torn, the cart between me and my stepson, my phone in my hand. Should I chase after him and risk missing the chance to connect with my mentor, or reply to her now and let the moment of discipline slip by? My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me."}
