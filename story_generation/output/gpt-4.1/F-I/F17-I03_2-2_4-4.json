My mom\u2019s words from breakfast echoed in my mind: \u201cIt\u2019s important we all have dinner together tonight. We need to keep our traditions alive.\u201d She\u2019d looked at me with that gentle, expectant smile, the one that always made me feel like a little kid again. But then there was Alex, who\u2019d texted me just an hour ago: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to finally have an evening with you before I leave. Just us?\u201d I knew how much this meant to him\u2014we\u2019d barely seen each other lately, and tonight was our only chance before his trip. My heart twisted as I pictured my family around the table, laughter and stories filling the room, and then imagined Alex\u2019s hopeful face, waiting for me at our favorite caf\u00e9.
