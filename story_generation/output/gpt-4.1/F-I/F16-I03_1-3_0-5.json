My husband walked in, dropping his bag with a sigh. \u201cWork was a bit much today,\u201d he said, rubbing his temples. I knew he wanted me to listen, to offer comfort, maybe make his favorite tea and sit with him while he unwound. But my phone kept lighting up\u2014my boyfriend was texting, reminding me that this was our last weekend together before he moved abroad. He wanted to go out, make memories, and savor every moment before the distance set in. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. My husband needed me to be present, to care, to be his anchor. My boyfriend needed me to be fun, attentive, and fully there for him. I stared at the wall, feeling the weight of both their expectations pressing down on me, unsure how to be what each of them needed at the same time."}
