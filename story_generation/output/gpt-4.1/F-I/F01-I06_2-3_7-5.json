She was so excited, and I knew she expected me to call, to share in her joy, to be the supportive grandfather I always tried to be. At the same time, my mind kept drifting back to the email from my mentor, asking for an update on the project. The truth was, things weren\u2019t going well. My teammates and I had hit a wall, and the tension was threatening to derail everything. I knew I should reach out to my mentor, be honest about the challenges, but I hesitated. I could almost hear my granddaughter\u2019s voice, eager for my encouragement, while my mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind, expecting transparency and initiative. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my attention, each expecting me to be present and engaged. I felt torn, caught between the warmth of family and the pressure of professional growth, unsure which call to make first."}
