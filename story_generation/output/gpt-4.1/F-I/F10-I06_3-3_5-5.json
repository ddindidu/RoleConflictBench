I knew how much this meant to her, to everyone. But my phone buzzed with another message from my mentor, asking for updates on the project. The conflict with my teammates had grown worse, and our deadline was slipping away. I was supposed to be honest and proactive, to let my mentor know about any issues immediately. But how could I admit I was struggling, that I might let the team down? My family needed me to be present, to honor our values, while my mentor expected transparency and commitment. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I felt torn, unable to give either side what they truly needed from me."}
