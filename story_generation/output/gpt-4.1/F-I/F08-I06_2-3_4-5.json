The whole family was gathered, waiting for me to join them in the living room to watch the video she\u2019d been talking about for weeks. I knew how much it meant to her\u2014and to everyone else\u2014that I was present, truly present, for these moments. But my phone buzzed again, a reminder of the message I\u2019d drafted to my mentor. The conflict with my project teammates had escalated, and the deadline was looming. My mentor had always emphasized the importance of open communication, especially when things went wrong. I could almost hear her voice: \u201cDon\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late to ask for help.\u201d My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the laughter and warmth of my family, and toward the responsibility I felt as a mentee not to let my mentor down. I stared at my phone, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me as the sounds of my granddaughter\u2019s laughter drifted in from the next room."}
