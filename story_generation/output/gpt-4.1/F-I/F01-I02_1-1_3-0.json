My daughter had called earlier, reminding me how much the grandkids were looking forward to seeing me. I could already picture their eager faces, the laughter, the warmth of being surrounded by family. But as I set my phone down, I heard the front door open. My partner walked in, her shoulders slumped, eyes tired. She tried to smile, but I could see the weight of her day pressing down on her. She didn\u2019t say much, just sat quietly on the couch, fiddling with her bracelet. I knew she needed me\u2014someone to listen, to hold her, to reassure her that everything would be okay. My heart tugged in two directions: the promise I\u2019d made to my family, and the silent plea in my partner\u2019s eyes. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the laughter waiting for me at my daughter\u2019s house and the quiet comfort I could offer here. The clock ticked on, and I felt the pressure of both worlds closing in, demanding I choose."}
