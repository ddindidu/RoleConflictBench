Our argument earlier had spiraled out of control, and now he was questioning if we should even be together. I knew he expected me to call, to talk things through, to resolve this before it became irreparable. But across from me, my husband sat quietly, his eyes shadowed with worry. He\u2019d been withdrawn all week, and I knew he needed me to ask, to listen, to be the partner who shares and supports. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me\u2014my husband\u2019s need for open communication, my boyfriend\u2019s plea for resolution. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the two people who needed me in completely different ways, and I wondered how I could possibly be enough for both."}
