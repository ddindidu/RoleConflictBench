My daughter\u2019s open class was scheduled for Thursday afternoon\u2014the same time I\u2019d promised my mentee, Sarah, a crucial meeting to discuss her job offer. She\u2019d been waiting anxiously for my guidance, and I knew how much this decision meant for her future. At the same time, my daughter had been practicing her presentation for weeks, her eyes lighting up every time she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, right, Dad?\u201d The school expected parents to show up, to support and encourage, and I could already picture her scanning the classroom for my face. But Sarah was counting on me too, and as her mentor, I was supposed to be reliable, present, and thorough. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, each tugging me in a different direction. I felt torn, guilty at the thought of letting either of them down, and as the day drew closer, the knot in my stomach only tightened."}
