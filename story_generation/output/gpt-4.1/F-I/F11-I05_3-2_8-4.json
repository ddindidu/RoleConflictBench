My notes were spread out, color-coded and precise, ready to guide my mentees through the skills they\u2019d need for the big project. Just as I was about to log in, my phone buzzed\u2014my younger sister, upset, her message a jumble of frustration and hurt. We\u2019d argued last night, and she wanted to talk, to clear the air. As her sister, I knew I should be there, listen, and rebuild the trust between us. But as a mentor, I was expected to be prepared, focused, and present for my team, who were counting on me to help them succeed. My heart twisted, torn between the urge to call my sister and the responsibility to my mentees. Both needed me, both deserved my attention, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The weight of their expectations pressed on me, and I stared at my phone, paralyzed, unsure which role to choose."}
