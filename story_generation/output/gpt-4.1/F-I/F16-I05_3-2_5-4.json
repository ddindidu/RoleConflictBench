The living room was a mess\u2014cushions scattered, dust on the shelves, and the kitchen sink piled high. My spouse\u2019s voice echoed from the hallway, \u201cCan you help me get the guest room ready? They\u2019ll be here in two hours!\u201d I glanced at the clock. In thirty minutes, I was supposed to lead a virtual session, guiding my mentees through the final steps before their big project deadline. They were counting on me to share the insights I\u2019d promised, and I knew how much they needed this last push. But at the same time, my partner\u2019s eyes pleaded for support, the unspoken expectation that we\u2019d present a united front to our visiting relatives. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my home and the responsibility to my team. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt the tension coil in my chest as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
