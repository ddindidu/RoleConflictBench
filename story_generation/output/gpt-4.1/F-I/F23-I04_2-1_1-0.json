My stepdaughter had been talking about it for days, her eyes shining with hope that I\u2019d be there, cheering her on from the back of the classroom. I knew how much it meant to her, especially since her mom couldn\u2019t make it this time. Just as I was about to grab my keys, my phone buzzed. It was Jamie, my oldest friend, sending a string of messages about how awful her day had been, how she just needed someone to listen. I could almost hear her voice, tired and desperate for comfort. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the supportive friend she counted on, the one who always picked up the phone. But I also wanted to be the reliable step-parent, the one who showed up when it mattered. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between two people who needed me in different ways, at the exact same time."}
