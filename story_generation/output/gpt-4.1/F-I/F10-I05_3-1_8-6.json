She\u2019d been missing deadlines, and I\u2019d noticed her stress mounting during our last check-in. As her mentor, I knew I needed to help her develop better time management skills, to encourage her growth and guide her through this rough patch. But before I could reply, my mom sat down across from me, her eyes red and tired. She started talking about how overwhelmed she felt caring for my dad after his surgery, her voice trembling as she admitted she didn\u2019t know how much longer she could keep it together. I reached for her hand, feeling the weight of her vulnerability, knowing she needed me to listen, to comfort her, to be the supportive daughter she counted on. My mind raced, torn between the urge to be present for my mom and the responsibility I felt toward Sarah, who was waiting for guidance. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself caught in the middle, heart aching, unsure which role to answer first."}
