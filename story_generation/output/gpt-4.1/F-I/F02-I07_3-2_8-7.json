They were waiting for my input on the project, and I knew every minute I delayed was holding them back. My manager had just sent a reminder: \u201cPlease respond ASAP so we can move forward.\u201d I glanced at the spreadsheet open on my laptop, the numbers for our home loan repayment staring back at me. Two months left, and I needed to double-check our finances, maybe even call the bank to discuss options. My wife had texted earlier, worried about the upcoming payment. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my family counting on me to keep us secure, my colleagues relying on me to keep the workflow moving. My heart pounded as I stared at the blinking cursor in my draft email, torn between opening the banking app or hitting send. The pressure built, and I wondered how I could possibly meet everyone\u2019s expectations at once."}
