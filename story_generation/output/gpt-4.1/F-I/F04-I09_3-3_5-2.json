Today was the big family celebration, and everyone expected me to be there, laughing, helping set the table, and joining in the games. My little sister had already texted, \u201cDon\u2019t be late!\u201d But as I was getting ready, I got a message from Mrs. Lee, my neighbor from down the hall. She wanted to talk in the lobby about the noise complaint that had been going around. I knew she expected me to be calm, polite, and neighborly\u2014maybe even help smooth things over since I\u2019d always been friendly with everyone on our floor. My parents were calling me to come downstairs, but I could hear Mrs. Lee\u2019s footsteps in the hallway, waiting for me. I felt pulled in two directions, my stomach tight with worry. I didn\u2019t want to let my family down, but I also didn\u2019t want to seem rude or uncaring to my neighbors. I stood frozen by the door, heart pounding, unsure which way to turn."}
