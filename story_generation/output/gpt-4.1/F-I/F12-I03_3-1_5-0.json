My husband was bustling around, vacuuming the living room, both of us tense with the knowledge that his relatives would arrive in less than an hour. Every surface had to gleam, every cushion had to be fluffed just so. He expected me to coordinate the chores, to make sure nothing was overlooked, and I felt the weight of his silent expectation pressing on my shoulders.\n\nMy phone buzzed on the counter. It was a message from my boyfriend: \u201cRough day. Can I call you?\u201d I could almost hear the fatigue in his words, the unspoken need for comfort. He always said I was the only one who really listened, who made him feel understood. I wanted to be there for him, to offer the gentle words and reassurance he craved.\n\nBut the kitchen timer beeped, snapping me back. I was torn, heart pulled in two directions\u2014one by the home I\u2019d built, the other by the heart I\u2019d promised to hold. I stared at my phone, suds dripping from my fingers, caught between the demands of being a good wife and a caring girlfriend, not knowing which role to answer first."}
