She was upset about something I\u2019d said last night, and she wanted to talk it through. I knew how important it was to her that we communicate openly and resolve things quickly\u2014she always said that\u2019s how we\u2019d build real respect between us. But as I glanced at my laptop, the unfinished report for work glared back at me. My team was counting on me to finish it, even though the deadline wasn\u2019t pressing and they could move forward without it for now. Still, I felt the weight of responsibility; I didn\u2019t want to let my colleagues down or seem unreliable. My mind spun with the competing demands: be the supportive sister who listens and repairs, or the dependable colleague who delivers on promises. I could feel the tension tightening in my chest, torn between the urge to call my sister and the guilt of leaving my work unfinished."}
