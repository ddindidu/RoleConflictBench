My friend\u2019s name flashed on the screen, and as soon as I answered, I heard his choked sobs. He could barely speak, but I understood enough\u2014he\u2019d just lost his brother. My heart ached for him, and I knew he needed me to listen, to be the friend who stays on the line through the darkest hours. But as I tried to comfort him, another call came through. It was my daughter, her voice trembling. Something serious had happened at home, and she needed me there, right away. As a grandfather, I was expected to be the steady presence, the one who holds the family together in crisis. I could hear my grandchildren crying in the background. My friend\u2019s pain pulled at me from one side, my family\u2019s need from the other. I sat there, phone in hand, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which call to answer first."}
