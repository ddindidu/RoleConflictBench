It\u2019s our tradition.\u201d The scent of simmering stew filled the house, and I could hear my younger step-siblings laughing in the living room. I knew how much it meant to her, especially since she\u2019d been trying so hard to make me feel part of the family. But my phone buzzed with reminders\u2014my mentees were waiting for me online. The project deadline was looming, and I\u2019d promised them a session tonight to walk through the final steps. They depended on me, and I\u2019d spent hours preparing slides and examples, determined not to let them down.

Both sides expected my full presence, and I felt the weight of their hopes pressing in from all directions."}
