The deadline was tomorrow, and I knew how important it was\u2014not just for me, but for my mentor\u2019s reputation with upper management. Every minute I spent not working on it felt like a betrayal of their trust in me. But as I tried to focus, I heard my parents\u2019 voices in the living room, quieter than usual, tinged with exhaustion. Lately, they\u2019d seemed weighed down, their faces drawn and their words clipped. I knew they needed me, not just as a presence, but as someone to listen, to reassure them that things would be okay. My heart twisted with guilt. If I closed my laptop and went to them, I\u2019d fall behind on the assignment. If I stayed, I\u2019d be ignoring the people who\u2019d always been there for me. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt paralyzed, torn between being the supportive son my parents needed and the diligent mentee my mentor expected."}
