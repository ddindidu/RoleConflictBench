Some people started speculating about his motives, and the talk edged dangerously close to gossip. I felt uncomfortable, knowing that as an acquaintance, I was expected not to join in or encourage negative talk. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my younger sister: \u201cCan you call me? I really need you.\u201d She had just received some terrible news about her job, and I knew she was devastated. As her sibling, I was expected to be there for her, to support her emotionally, especially now. But if I excused myself from the group, I worried it would look suspicious, as if I was running off to share or fuel the gossip. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the urgent need to comfort my sister and the pressure to maintain my integrity among my acquaintances."}
