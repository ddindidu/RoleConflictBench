Minutes later, my granddaughter appeared at my door, her eyes red and voice trembling. \u201cGrandma, can we talk? I really need your advice.\u201d She clutched her backpack, looking so much like her mother did at that age, lost and searching for answers only I could give. My heart ached to wrap her in my arms, to listen and offer the comfort of stories and lessons I\u2019d gathered over decades. Yet, I knew my mentee was counting on me too, hoping I\u2019d help her find the confidence to take the next step in her career. Both needed me, both trusted me to guide them, but in such different ways. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, torn between the wisdom I owed my family and the encouragement I promised to those I mentor. I stood in the hallway, caught between two doors, my mind racing as I tried to decide who needed me most in this moment."}
