They needed me\u2014my reassurance, my advice, my full attention. I could see the anxiety in their eyes, and I wanted nothing more than to be the supportive spouse they deserved. But as I reached for their hand, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the HOA inspection was in an hour. I\u2019d left a couple of boxes in the corridor after cleaning out the closet, and I knew the rules\u2014nothing was supposed to block the emergency exit. If I didn\u2019t move them, I risked a citation and the neighbors\u2019 irritation. If I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning my partner in a moment of vulnerability. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides. I could feel the tension in my chest, torn between being the spouse my partner needed and the neighbor everyone expected me to be."}
