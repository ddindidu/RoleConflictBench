My daughter\u2019s voice still echoed in my ears, shaky and uncertain as she confided in me about her husband\u2019s sudden illness. She needed me\u2014my presence, my reassurance, the steadying comfort only a grandparent could offer. I knew the family expected me to be the glue, the one who checked in, who held everyone together when things fell apart.\n\nBut just as I was about to call her back, my phone buzzed with a message from Maya, my mentee. She was hours away from presenting her project, the one we\u2019d worked on for months, the one that could launch her career. She needed my encouragement, my last-minute advice, my belief in her abilities. As her mentor, I was supposed to be her anchor, the person who pushed her to grow, to believe in herself when it mattered most.\n\nI stared at the phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My heart ached with the impossible choice\u2014family or mentee, comfort or growth. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the demands of love and responsibility, knowing that whatever I chose, something precious would be left waiting."}
