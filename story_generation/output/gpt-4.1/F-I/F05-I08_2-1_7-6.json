I remembered our promise to always communicate openly, so I sat beside her and gently asked what was on her mind. She hesitated, then shared her worries about her job\u2014her boss had made some decisions that left her feeling anxious and undervalued. I listened, offering comfort, but inside, I felt a knot forming. Earlier that day, I\u2019d been with a group of acquaintances at work, and the conversation had turned to the very same boss. They were speculating, criticizing, and sharing rumors. I\u2019d kept quiet, knowing I shouldn\u2019t gossip or speak negatively about others, but now my wife was looking to me for understanding and maybe even validation of her feelings. I felt torn\u2014should I share what I\u2019d heard, risking gossip, or keep it to myself and possibly seem unsupportive? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat there, unsure of what to say next."}
