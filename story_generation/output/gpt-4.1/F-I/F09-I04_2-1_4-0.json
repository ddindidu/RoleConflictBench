I knew I needed to step in, to teach him about behaving properly in public, about respect and discipline. Just as I opened my mouth to call him back, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my friend, Sarah: \u201cRough day. Can you talk?\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words, and I knew she needed me to listen, to be there for her like I always promised I would. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my son, who needed guidance, and toward my friend, who needed comfort. I stood frozen for a moment, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
