The project deadline was looming, and my mentee needed this guidance to avoid the pitfalls I\u2019d once stumbled into myself. I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014passing on what I\u2019d learned, making sure they were ready. Just as I was about to start the video call, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my granddaughter, her words bubbling with excitement about her new job. She wanted to talk, to share her first impressions and the little victories of her first week. I knew how much it meant to her that I listened, that I was present for these milestones. But the clock was ticking, and my mentee was waiting, counting on me to help them succeed. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward family, where I was needed as a supportive grandparent, and toward my professional commitment as a mentor. I stared at the phone, torn, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
