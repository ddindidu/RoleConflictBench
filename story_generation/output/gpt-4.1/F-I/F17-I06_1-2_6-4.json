My mom was washing dishes, her movements slower than usual. I could sense something was off, so I asked, \u201cIs everything okay, Mom?\u201d She smiled, but it didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cJust tired, honey. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d I wanted to press further, to be the supportive child she needed, but my phone buzzed with a message from my mentor: \u201cAny updates on the project?\u201d The truth was, I\u2019d hit a technical wall days ago, but I hadn\u2019t told her yet. I knew she expected me to be open about challenges, to communicate so she could help. But if I messaged her now, I\u2019d have to leave my mom alone, and she seemed so fragile. My chest tightened as I looked between my mom and my phone, feeling pulled in two directions\u2014needing to be there for my family, but also not wanting to let my mentor down. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I didn\u2019t know which role to choose."}
