My mother\u2019s voice echoed from the living room, reminding me to help set the table and to wear the traditional scarf for tonight\u2019s family gathering. I knew how much these rituals meant to her, to all of them. As the eldest child, I was expected to honor our traditions, to show respect and keep the family\u2019s values alive.\n\nMy phone buzzed. It was a message from Maya, one of the students I mentored at the community center. She was anxious about her college application deadline and wanted to talk. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d be available if she needed guidance, and she rarely reached out. I felt the weight of her trust in me, the responsibility to be there for her, to offer the support I wished I\u2019d had at her age.\n\nI looked at the clock, then at the scarf in my hands. My family\u2019s laughter drifted in from the next room, while my phone vibrated again. I felt torn, pulled between the warmth of my family\u2019s expectations and the quiet plea for help from someone who counted on me."}
