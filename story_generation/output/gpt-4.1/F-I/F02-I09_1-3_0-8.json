My kids would be finishing school in half an hour, and I\u2019d promised to pick them up\u2014something I rarely missed, especially with the school year ending soon. As I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Lee, my neighbor. She was out of town and had asked me to keep an eye out for a package, especially today, since the building\u2019s power was scheduled to go out for a few hours. She sounded anxious, reminding me how important it was that her delivery didn\u2019t sit unattended in the hallway.\n\nI stood in the doorway, torn. If I left now, I\u2019d be on time for my kids, but I might miss the delivery. If I waited, I could help Mrs. Lee, but risk my children waiting alone at school, disappointed and worried. Both roles pulled at me\u2014my children\u2019s expectant faces, Mrs. Lee\u2019s trust in me as a neighbor. My mind raced, heart pounding, as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the stress of being needed in two places at once."}
