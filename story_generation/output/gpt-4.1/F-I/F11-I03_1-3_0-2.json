My little sister\u2019s voice message was bubbling with excitement\u2014she\u2019d just landed her dream job, and tonight she wanted to celebrate with me, just the two of us, like we always promised. I could almost hear her smile, and I knew how much this moment meant to her. But as I listened, my phone buzzed again. It was my boyfriend, his texts heavy with grief. He\u2019d lost his father unexpectedly, and he needed me\u2014needed my comfort, my presence, my arms around him as he tried to make sense of the world\u2019s cruelty.\n\nMy heart ached. My sister expected me to be her cheerleader, to show up and make her feel special, just as she\u2019d done for me so many times before. But my boyfriend was lost, and I was the only person he wanted right now. I felt pulled apart, guilty for even considering letting either of them down. I paced my room, clutching my phone, wishing I could split myself in two. The weight of their needs pressed on me, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
