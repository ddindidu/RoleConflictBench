I could sense her worry, the way she twisted her fingers together. As her grandmother, I felt the urge to offer comfort, to share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years. She deserved guidance, especially now, when she seemed so lost. But the words caught in my throat. Earlier that day, an acquaintance had confided in me, sharing a secret about someone my granddaughter knew\u2014a secret that, if revealed, could change how she saw that person forever. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t gossip or betray that trust. Yet, as a grandmother, I wanted to protect her, to help her make sense of her feelings. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding something different. My heart ached as I weighed the responsibility of guiding my granddaughter against the promise I\u2019d made to keep someone else\u2019s confidence. I sat in silence, torn between the two worlds, unsure which path to take."}
