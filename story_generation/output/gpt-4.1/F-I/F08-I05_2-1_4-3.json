My granddaughter tugged at my sleeve, her eyes sparkling with excitement as she prepared to share her big news with the family. I knew how much these moments meant\u2014being present, listening, celebrating together. Just as she began, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Maya, my mentee at work, asking if I had a moment to help her with a problem she\u2019d been struggling with all week. She rarely reached out outside our scheduled sessions, and I sensed her frustration in her words. I glanced at my family, gathered and waiting, and then at my phone, feeling the weight of Maya\u2019s trust in me. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the laughter and warmth of my family, and toward the responsibility I felt to guide Maya when she needed me most. I hesitated, torn between the joy of being a grandmother and the duty of being a mentor, unsure which call to answer first."}
