My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cI expect you to have this ready before our next meeting.\u201d The deadline was in three days, and I knew he would check every detail. But downstairs, I could hear my family laughing, the clatter of dishes, and the familiar scent of my mother\u2019s special holiday stew drifting up the stairs. Tonight was the start of our family\u2019s annual holiday tradition\u2014a time when everyone was expected to be present, to share stories, and to honor the rituals that meant so much to my parents.\n\nMy father had already called up once, reminding me, \u201cThis is important to your mother and me. We don\u2019t get these moments often.\u201d I felt the weight of their expectations pressing down, the unspoken rule that family comes first. But the code on my screen demanded my attention, and I knew my mentor would be disappointed if I let him down. Torn between the warmth of family tradition and the responsibility to my mentor, I sat frozen, heart pounding, unable to move in either direction."}
