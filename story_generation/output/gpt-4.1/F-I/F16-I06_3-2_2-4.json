My partner, eyes red and voice trembling, reached for my hand. They\u2019d barely slept in days, and I could feel the weight of their crisis pressing down on both of us. I knew they needed me\u2014needed my words, my arms, my undivided attention. But in the back of my mind, the technical problem at work gnawed at me. I was stuck, and my mentor had always said to reach out early if I hit a wall. I could almost hear her voice: \u201cDon\u2019t let things fester. Communicate.\u201d But how could I step away now, even for a few minutes, when my partner was so fragile? My heart ached with the pull in both directions\u2014one demanding my presence, the other my honesty and initiative. I stared at my phone, torn, feeling the pressure mount as I tried to decide who needed me more in this moment."}
