Mom\u2019s not well, and the kids are scared.\u201d My heart clenched. As a grandfather, I knew my family needed me\u2014my daughter was overwhelmed, and my grandchildren always looked to me for comfort in times like this. But as a colleague, I was expected to be present at this meeting; my input was crucial, and the team was counting on me to help finalize our project.
