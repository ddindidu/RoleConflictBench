My stepdaughter\u2019s school trip was coming up, and groceries were running low. I knew I had to pick up an extra shift tonight if we were going to make it through the month. Just as I was about to call my boss, my phone buzzed. It was Mark, my oldest friend. He sounded frantic\u2014he was on his way to the airport and thought he\u2019d left his passport at home. He begged me to check his apartment and, if I found it, rush it to him before his flight. I could hear the panic in his voice; he\u2019d always been there for me in a pinch. But if I missed this shift, I\u2019d lose the overtime pay we desperately needed. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my family and the loyalty to my friend. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, phone in hand, heart pounding, unable to move."}
