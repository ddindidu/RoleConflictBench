As his step-parent, I knew I should step in\u2014teach him about respect for public spaces, about discipline and self-control. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of the mentoring session I\u2019d scheduled for my intern in just an hour. I\u2019d promised her a focused, structured lesson on project management, something she needed before her big deadline. My mind raced: if I stopped now to correct my stepson, I\u2019d be late and unprepared for my mentee, letting her down when she needed me most. But if I ignored my stepson\u2019s behavior, I\u2019d miss a crucial moment to guide him, to show him the values I wanted him to learn. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be present, patient, and wise. I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to let down."}
