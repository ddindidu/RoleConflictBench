The first message was from my mom, asking how my morning was going and if I\u2019d eaten breakfast. The second was an email from a colleague, marked \u201cinformational\u2014no action needed.\u201d I knew my parents expected me to reply right away, to keep up our daily rhythm of check-ins and updates. At the same time, I felt the unspoken pressure at work to be responsive, even if the email didn\u2019t require an immediate answer. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both expectations. If I replied to my mom, I\u2019d be breaking my focus at work, risking falling behind. If I waited, I\u2019d feel guilty for making her worry. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between the comfort of family and the professionalism my colleagues counted on."}
