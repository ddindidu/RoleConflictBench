It was one of those small but important lessons in manners that I tried to reinforce every day, hoping to guide him with patience and consistency. Just as Ethan was about to ask for my help with a tricky math problem, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mark, an old acquaintance. His car had broken down on a deserted road, and he was asking if I could come pick him up. I could hear the urgency in his voice when I called him back\u2014he sounded stranded and anxious. I glanced at Ethan, who was waiting for my attention, and felt a knot tighten in my stomach. I knew Mark didn\u2019t have anyone else nearby to call, and I wanted to be the kind of person who offered help when needed. But I also knew how important it was to be present for Ethan, especially in these small, teachable moments. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which role to fulfill."}
