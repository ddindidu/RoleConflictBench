My son\u2019s excited voice from earlier echoed in my head\u2014he\u2019d been counting down the days until I could buy him the Nintendo I\u2019d promised. I\u2019d budgeted carefully, knowing that every dollar mattered, and this month was already tight. The promise weighed on me; I wanted to keep his trust, to see his face light up with joy.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed again. It was a frantic call from my best friend, stranded on the highway, scared and alone. She needed me to come get her right away\u2014no one else could help. I could hear the panic in her voice, and I knew she\u2019d do the same for me in a heartbeat.\n\nI felt torn in two. If I went to help her, I\u2019d have to dip into the money set aside for the Nintendo, risking my son\u2019s disappointment and our family\u2019s careful balance. But if I didn\u2019t go, I\u2019d be letting down someone who counted on me in a moment of real need. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which way to turn."}
