The whole family was gathered, waiting for me to say a few words, to share in her joy. My phone buzzed quietly in my pocket\u2014a reminder from my mentor to check in if I had any questions. I did have a small one, something about terminology in the project I was working on, but it wasn\u2019t urgent. Still, my mentor always emphasized the importance of open communication, even for minor concerns. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the expectation to be fully present for my family, to celebrate this milestone with my granddaughter, and the responsibility to be a diligent, proactive mentee. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my attention, each expectation valid. I glanced at my phone, then at my granddaughter\u2019s hopeful face, caught in the tension of wanting to be everything for everyone."}
