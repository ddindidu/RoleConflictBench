His words were heavy with grief\u2014he\u2019d just lost his father, and he needed me. I wanted to rush to his side, to hold him and let him lean on me, to be the steady presence he needed right now. But as I stood up, I caught sight of my granddaughter, Emma, sitting quietly on the porch, her shoulders slumped, eyes distant. She\u2019d been withdrawn for days, and I knew she was struggling with something she couldn\u2019t quite name. As her grandmother, I felt the pull to sit beside her, to offer the comfort and wisdom she might need, to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. My heart ached, torn between the urge to be the guiding hand for Emma and the supportive partner for Mark. Both needed me, both expected my presence and strength, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. I lingered in the doorway, feeling the weight of their needs pressing in from both sides, unsure which way to turn."}
