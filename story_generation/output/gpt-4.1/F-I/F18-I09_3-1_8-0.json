As we reached the corner, he darted ahead, his eyes fixed on the ice cream truck across the street. My heart jumped\u2014he didn\u2019t even glance at the traffic. I knew I had to shout, to grab his arm, to do anything to keep him safe. Just then, Mrs. Lee from next door stepped out of her apartment, right in front of me. She smiled warmly and said hello, expecting the usual friendly greeting in return. I could see her waiting, her arms full of groceries, clearly hoping for a moment of neighborly kindness. But my brother was already at the curb, one foot hovering over the street. I felt torn in two\u2014should I rush after my brother and risk seeming rude to Mrs. Lee, or pause to greet her and risk my brother\u2019s safety? My mind raced, my heart pounding, caught between the demands of being a good sibling and a good neighbor."}
