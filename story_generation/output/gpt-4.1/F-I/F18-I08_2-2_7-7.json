He grinned at me, eager to show off the new trick he\u2019d been practicing. As his older sibling, I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014should I warn him about the risks, or let him learn on his own? Just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed. It was Jamie, an acquaintance from work, standing nearby. She leaned in, lowering her voice, \u201cDid you see what Mark did in the meeting? He totally messed up the presentation. I don\u2019t know how he still has a job.\u201d I knew I shouldn\u2019t encourage gossip, but my mind was split. My brother was about to launch himself down a dangerous ramp, and Jamie was waiting for my reaction. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014should I call out to my brother, risking Jamie thinking I was rude or uninterested, or respond to Jamie and risk not being there for my brother if he needed me? My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the demands of being a good sibling and a considerate acquaintance."}
