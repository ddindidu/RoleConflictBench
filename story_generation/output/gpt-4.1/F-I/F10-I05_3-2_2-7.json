I knew she expected me to answer quickly, to share how my day was going, to listen to her stories about the neighbors and her worries about Dad\u2019s health. It was our routine\u2014daily check-ins, no matter how busy I was. But across the table, my mentee sat hunched over her laptop, eyes wide with anxiety as she scrolled through her presentation slides. She needed my full attention, my encouragement, and my honest feedback to help her seize this career-changing opportunity. I could see her glancing at me, waiting for guidance, while my phone vibrated again, a reminder of my promise to always be there for my parents. My heart twisted as I weighed the expectations\u2014my family\u2019s need for connection and reassurance, my mentee\u2019s hope for support and growth. I stared at my phone, torn between answering my mother\u2019s call and staying present for the young woman who depended on me."}
