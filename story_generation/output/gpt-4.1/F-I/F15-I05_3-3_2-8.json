My heart pounded as I read the message: my son had been caught bullying a classmate. The principal wanted to meet with me today. As a parent, I knew I needed to be there, to show my son that his actions had consequences and to support him through this difficult moment. But just as I was about to call the school back, my mentee\u2019s name flashed in my inbox. She was on the verge of presenting her project\u2014one that could launch her career\u2014and she was panicking, asking for my guidance. She depended on me to help her find her confidence, to be the steady hand she needed right now. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My child needed me to be a present, responsible parent. My mentee needed me to be a reliable, encouraging mentor. I sat at my desk, paralyzed, the clock ticking, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
