I knew something was wrong\u2014lately, they\u2019d been quieter, more withdrawn. Remembering our promise to always communicate openly, I reached out, gently asking what was on their mind. As they began to share the stress from work and worries about their health, my phone buzzed. It was my best friend, calling at this late hour. I hesitated, but answered, only to hear their sobs\u2014something terrible had happened in their family, and they needed me to listen, to be there for them, just as I always had. My spouse\u2019s voice faltered, their eyes searching mine for comfort, while my friend\u2019s pain echoed through the phone. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014one by the person I promised to share my life with, the other by the friend who\u2019d always counted on my support. The weight of both their needs pressed down on me, and I sat there, caught between the expectations of being a good spouse and a loyal friend, unsure of how to be both at once."}
