She looked anxious, twirling a strand of hair around her finger. \u201cGrandma, how did you know what to do after high school? I feel so lost.\u201d I could see she wanted guidance, maybe even a story from my own life to help her make sense of her choices. I opened my mouth to answer, but my phone buzzed. It was my friend, Linda: \u201cRough day. Everything feels pointless. Can you talk?\u201d I knew Linda needed me to listen, to be present and supportive, not to offer solutions but to simply hear her out. Emma\u2019s eyes were on me, searching for wisdom, while my phone screen glowed with Linda\u2019s plea for comfort. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014one toward the role of wise grandmother, the other toward the role of empathetic friend. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which need to answer first."}
