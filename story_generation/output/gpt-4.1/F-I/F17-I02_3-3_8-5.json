My mom\u2019s voice still echoed in my mind\u2014she had just confided in me about her fears of growing old alone, her words trembling with vulnerability. She needed me, wanted me to sit with her, listen, maybe just hold her hand for a while. But my phone screen lit up with a message from my girlfriend: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you tonight. Only one more weekend before I leave.\u201d I\u2019d promised her this time, just us, no distractions. She was leaving for months, and we\u2019d both been counting down to this last weekend together. My heart twisted, torn between the urge to comfort my mom and the promise I\u2019d made to my girlfriend. I could feel the weight of both their expectations pressing down on me, each pulling me in a different direction. I stared at the wall, paralyzed, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
