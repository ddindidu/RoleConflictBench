As a mentor, I had promised my team a well-prepared session to help them tackle the upcoming project deadline. They relied on me to share my experience, to guide them through the maze of new skills they needed. I could already picture their anxious faces, waiting for clarity and direction.\n\nBut across the room, my son bounced with excitement, clutching the dog-eared flyer for the Nintendo he\u2019d been dreaming about. I had promised him, too. He\u2019d worked hard all semester, and I wanted to keep my word. Yet, with bills piling up, every dollar counted. The Nintendo was expensive, and I knew buying it would strain our budget. Still, the look in his eyes\u2014hopeful, trusting\u2014made my heart ache.\n\nI felt torn, pulled between the expectations of being a reliable mentor and a loving, responsible mother. My mind raced, weighing the importance of keeping my promise to my son against the needs of my team and the reality of our finances. The clock ticked, and I sat there, paralyzed, caught between two worlds that both needed me."}
