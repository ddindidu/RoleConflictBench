My stepdad shuffled in, rubbing his temples, and my mom barely glanced up from her coffee, her eyes rimmed red. I knew they\u2019d had another rough night, and I felt the weight of their exhaustion pressing on me.

They were waiting for my input on a project, and I could almost hear the impatience in their emails. I was supposed to be responsive, a reliable colleague, but every minute I spent here, not answering, the pressure mounted.
