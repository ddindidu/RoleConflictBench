Mom\u2019s text was clear: \u201cEveryone needs to be there. It\u2019s important.\u201d I knew how much these gatherings meant to her, and as the oldest sister, I was expected to help set up, keep the younger kids entertained, and just be present. But then, my email pinged\u2014a message from Dr. Patel, my mentor. She\u2019d managed to squeeze in a quick meeting for me between her back-to-back appointments. \u201cLet\u2019s meet at 6 PM sharp. I only have 20 minutes,\u201d she wrote. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. If I left for the meeting, I\u2019d miss the start of dinner and disappoint my family. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down Dr. Patel, who had gone out of her way for me. Both sides expected my full attention, and I could already hear the disappointment in their voices, whichever way I turned. My mind raced, torn between being the reliable sister and the respectful mentee, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
