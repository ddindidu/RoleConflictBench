It\u2019s about Jamie.\u201d My heart clenched. Jamie, my grandson, was struggling again, and I knew my daughter needed me\u2014needed the steady voice of her mother, the reassurance that things would be okay. I\u2019d always promised to be there, to keep the family close, to never let anyone feel alone. \n\nBut as I reached for the phone, I heard the front door open. My boyfriend stepped in, smiling, holding takeout and a bottle of wine. \u201cFinally, a night just for us,\u201d he said, his eyes warm. We\u2019d been looking forward to this evening all week, the only time we\u2019d have together before he left for his business trip. He\u2019d been so patient with my family obligations, but I knew he wanted\u2014needed\u2014my undivided attention tonight.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. My family expected me to be the anchor, always available. My boyfriend hoped for intimacy, for a night where I was his, not split between roles. My phone buzzed again. I stood frozen, caught between the voices that needed me, unsure which to answer first."}
