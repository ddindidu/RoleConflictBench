I really need to talk.\u201d I could hear the strain in her words, and I knew she wouldn\u2019t reach out unless it was serious. As her brother, I\u2019d always promised to be there, especially when she was struggling. But as I glanced at my laptop, the unfinished project report glared back at me. My team at work was counting on me to finish my part, even though the deadline was still a few days away and the others could move forward without it for now. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014my sister needed my support, but my colleagues expected reliability and commitment. My mind raced, torn between the urge to rush to her side and the responsibility to my team. I could feel anxiety tightening in my chest as I tried to figure out how to be the brother she needed and the colleague my team depended on, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
