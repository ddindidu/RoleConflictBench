His final exam was tomorrow, and I could see the anxiety etched on his face. I knew he needed me\u2014someone to reassure him, to remind him he\u2019d done all he could. That\u2019s what we promised each other when our parents married: to be there, especially when things got tough. My phone buzzed. It was my best friend, Sarah. \u201cUgh, today was the worst. Can you talk?\u201d she wrote. I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of her words. She always counted on me to listen, to be the one who\u2019d make her laugh after a bad day. I glanced at my stepbrother, who looked like he might break down any second, then back at my phone. My chest tightened. Both of them needed me right now, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. I felt torn, guilty for even hesitating, as if choosing one meant letting the other down. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing, caught between two worlds that both expected me to be their anchor."}
