The house was a whirlwind of activity\u2014relatives would arrive in a few hours, and every surface needed to shine. She glanced at me, her eyes silently pleading for help with the vacuuming. I nodded, feeling the weight of her expectation. My phone buzzed on the counter. A message from my manager: \u201cNeed your confirmation ASAP for the partner meeting. Can\u2019t move forward without it.\u201d I stared at the screen, heart pounding. If I didn\u2019t reply quickly, the project could stall, and my team would be left waiting.
