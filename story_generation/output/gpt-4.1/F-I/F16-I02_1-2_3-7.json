My spouse sighs as she passes by, her eyes lingering on the mess. I know she expects me to help, to share the load, especially since we both work long hours. I promised I\u2019d fold it tonight, but my phone buzzes\u2014another message from my girlfriend. We\u2019ve argued three times this week about money, and she wants to talk, to resolve things before it festers. She expects me to be present, to listen, to fix what\u2019s wrong between us. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me: the quiet, steady need for partnership at home, and the urgent, emotional demand for resolution in my relationship. My hands hover over the laundry, but my mind is already with her, replaying our last argument. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the guilt gnaws at me, knowing someone will be disappointed no matter what I choose."}
