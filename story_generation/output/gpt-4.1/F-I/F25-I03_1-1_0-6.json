My stepdad had just texted, \u201cHope you\u2019re having a good weekend. Let us know if you want to come by for dinner.\u201d I knew he and Mom expected me to check in, even if it was just a quick message. They always said it made them feel included in my life. But just as I started typing a reply, my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, it was Alex. \u201cCan we talk? I feel weird about what happened earlier,\u201d she wrote. We\u2019d had a small argument about our plans, and I could tell she wanted to resolve it right away. She hated leaving things unsettled, and I didn\u2019t want her to think I didn\u2019t care. My heart pounded as I looked between the two conversations, feeling pulled in opposite directions. I wanted to be a good daughter, but I also wanted to be a supportive girlfriend. The pressure built in my chest as I tried to figure out who needed me more in that moment, and what I should do first."}
