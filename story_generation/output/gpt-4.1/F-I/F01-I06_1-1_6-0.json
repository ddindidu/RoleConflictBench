The family holiday was just days away, and my daughter had called earlier, reminding me how much everyone looked forward to our annual gathering. She hoped I\u2019d help organize the games and maybe share a story or two from my youth. I could almost hear the expectation in her voice\u2014being present, being the glue that held us together.\n\nBut on my desk lay a thick stack of articles my mentor had recommended. \u201cNo rush,\u201d he\u2019d said, but I knew he valued initiative and thoroughness. I wanted to impress him, to show I was committed to my growth. The reading wasn\u2019t urgent, but it was important, and I felt the weight of his trust in me.\n\nAs I glanced between the family group chat buzzing on my phone and the dense academic text in front of me, a knot tightened in my chest. I wanted to be the reliable grandfather, the eager mentee. But the hours in a day felt too few, and I wondered how I could possibly meet both expectations without letting someone down."}
