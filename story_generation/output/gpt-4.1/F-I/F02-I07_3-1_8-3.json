The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a constant reminder that I needed to keep our finances in order for my family\u2019s sake. My wife had mentioned the kids\u2019 school fees were coming up too, and I felt the weight of being the provider pressing down on my shoulders. At the same time, my inbox pinged with a reminder from my team lead about the project I was supposed to finish. The deadline was still a few weeks away, and honestly, the others could move forward without my part for now. But I knew my colleagues expected me to pull my weight, to be reliable and not let the team down. I could feel the tension building inside me\u2014should I spend the evening crunching numbers and planning our budget, or should I log back in and get ahead on my work tasks? Both roles demanded my attention, and I felt torn, knowing that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
