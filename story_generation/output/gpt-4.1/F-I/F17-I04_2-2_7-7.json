They\u2019d both been quieter lately, sighing more, and I could feel the heaviness in the air. I wanted to ask if they were okay, to sit with them and maybe make them smile, but my phone buzzed again. It was my friend, still upset about the text I\u2019d sent earlier. She thought I was annoyed with her, and her last message was sharp, almost accusing. I knew I needed to call her right away, to clear things up before it got worse. But as I glanced at my parents, I felt torn. They needed me to be present, to show I cared, but my friend needed me too, to explain and fix what I\u2019d accidentally broken. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out who needed me more in this moment, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
