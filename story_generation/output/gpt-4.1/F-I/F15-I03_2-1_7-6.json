My son\u2019s shoes were worn through, and the fridge was nearly empty. I knew I had to pick up an extra shift this weekend to make ends meet. Just as I was calculating how to stretch the grocery money, my phone buzzed. It was Mia, my girlfriend. Her message was short: \u201cCan we talk? I\u2019m upset about the weekend.\u201d I remembered our plans\u2014she\u2019d been looking forward to our Saturday together, just the two of us. Now, with the extra shift, I\u2019d have to cancel. I could already hear the disappointment in her voice, the way she\u2019d want to talk it through, to resolve things right away. My chest tightened. I wanted to be there for her, to show her she mattered, but my family needed me too. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, and I stared at my phone, torn between answering her call and figuring out how to keep the lights on."}
