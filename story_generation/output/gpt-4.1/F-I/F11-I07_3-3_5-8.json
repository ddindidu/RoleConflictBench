My mom\u2019s text was clear: \u201cWe really want you there this year. It means a lot to everyone.\u201d I could almost hear her hopeful voice, and I knew how much my presence mattered, especially to my younger brother who always looked up to me. At the same time, my work email pinged with a message from my manager, marked urgent. The leadership team needed my confirmation on a project detail for an external partner, and they were waiting for my reply to move forward. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014my family expecting me to be fully present and engaged, my colleagues counting on my quick response to keep things on track. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be a good sister and a reliable colleague at the same time, feeling the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
