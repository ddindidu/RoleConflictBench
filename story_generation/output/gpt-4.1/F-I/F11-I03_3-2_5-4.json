Mom\u2019s text was clear: \u201cIt means a lot if you\u2019re there. We haven\u2019t all been together in months.\u201d I could almost hear her voice, warm but insistent, and I knew how much she wanted me to be present, to laugh and share stories at the table. But then my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from Alex. \u201cCan\u2019t wait for our night together. I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d We\u2019d both been so busy, and this was our only free evening before I left for a week. He was counting on me, hoping for a quiet night, just us. My chest tightened as I pictured disappointing either side. I wanted to be the sister who showed up, the girlfriend who cared. But I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The weight of their expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, torn between the people I loved, wishing I didn\u2019t have to choose."}
