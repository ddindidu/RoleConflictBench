It means a lot to your dad.\u201d I knew how important these family trips were, especially since I\u2019d only become a part of this family a couple of years ago. They expected me to show up, to be present, to help bridge the awkward gaps that still lingered between us. But just as I was about to reply, my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, it was Mia. \u201cI thought we were spending Saturday together. Why didn\u2019t you tell me about your trip?\u201d Her message was short, but I could sense the hurt behind it. As her boyfriend, I was supposed to be honest, to smooth over these little bumps before they grew into something bigger. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my family needed me to be there, to fit in, while Mia needed reassurance and my attention. I sat on the edge of my bed, torn, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure how to be what everyone needed at the same time."}
