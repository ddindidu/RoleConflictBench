It was just a routine catch-up, nothing urgent, and I knew it would be recorded. Still, I could already imagine the subtle disappointment in my manager\u2019s voice if I didn\u2019t show up. At the same time, my son tugged at my sleeve, his eyes wide with anticipation. I had promised him a Nintendo if I got my bonus, and today was the day I was supposed to take him to the store. The bonus had come, but it wasn\u2019t as much as I\u2019d hoped. I felt the weight of our bills, the groceries, the rent, all pressing down on me. My colleagues expected me to be present, to contribute, to be a team player. My son expected me to keep my promise, to be the parent who made his day. I felt torn, the demands of work and family pulling me in opposite directions, my heart pounding as I tried to figure out which expectation I would have to let down."}
