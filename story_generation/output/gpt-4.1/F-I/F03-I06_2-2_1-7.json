It was Sunday evening\u2014my usual time to call my parents. I could already picture my mom waiting by the phone, eager to hear about my week, and my dad ready with his gentle reminders to take care of myself. But today, my mentor had squeezed me into her packed schedule for a quick meeting. She\u2019d emphasized how tight her day was, and I knew how much she valued punctuality and focus. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the warmth and expectation of my family, and the professional respect I owed my mentor. My parents counted on these calls to feel connected, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t risk seeming uncommitted or disrespectful to my mentor, not after she\u2019d made time for me. My thumb hovered over the phone, torn between dialing home and silencing it for the meeting, my heart pounding with the pressure of choosing who to disappoint."}
