My partner sits at the kitchen table, shoulders slumped, eyes searching mine for reassurance. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d they whisper, voice trembling. They need me\u2014my advice, my comfort, my undivided attention. I reach for their hand, but my mind flickers to Mrs. Lee, our elderly neighbor down the hall. She lives alone, and the storm advisory mentioned possible power outages and delays. I promised her I\u2019d check in if anything happened, maybe even help her secure her windows or bring her a flashlight. My partner\u2019s grip tightens, pulling me back to the moment. I see the expectation in their eyes: to be present, to listen, to help them through this work crisis. But I can\u2019t ignore the nagging worry for Mrs. Lee, who might be frightened or unprepared. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my care, each urgent in its own way. My heart pounds as I stand between the kitchen and the hallway, torn by the needs of the person I love and the neighbor who depends on me."}
