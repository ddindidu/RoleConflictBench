Her eyes were wide, uncertain. \u201cGrandpa, how do you know when you\u2019re ready to move out on your own?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. I could see she needed more than just a quick answer\u2014she wanted reassurance, wisdom, the kind of guidance only someone who\u2019s lived through it can give. I leaned forward, ready to share my stories and advice, when my phone buzzed urgently. It was a frantic call from my oldest friend, Mark. His car had broken down on the highway, miles from town, and he sounded scared. \u201cCan you come get me? I don\u2019t know who else to call,\u201d he pleaded. My heart twisted. My granddaughter\u2019s hopeful gaze was fixed on me, waiting for comfort, while Mark\u2019s voice echoed in my ear, desperate for help. I felt torn, the weight of both their needs pressing down on me, unsure which role I could bear to let down."}
