She handed me a box of decorations and asked me to put them in the corridor for a moment, just like we always did when space got tight. It was a small thing, part of our tradition\u2014making room for everyone, even if it meant a little clutter outside our door. But as I stepped into the hallway, I remembered the HOA notice: an inspection tomorrow, and anything left in the corridor could get us fined for blocking the emergency exit. \n\nAs a neighbor, I knew I should keep the hallway clear, respecting the rules and the safety of everyone on our floor. But as a daughter, I didn\u2019t want to disappoint Mom or break the flow of our family tradition. My heart pounded as I stood there, decorations in hand, torn between honoring my family and being a responsible neighbor."}
