We\u2019d argued again\u2014this time about my dog, Max, barking whenever someone walked past our apartment. She said it embarrassed her, that it made us look inconsiderate to the neighbors. I wanted to talk it out, to show her I respected her feelings and that we could find a solution together, like we always tried to do as siblings. But just as I was about to knock on her door, I heard Mrs. Lee from next door muttering about \u201cthat dog\u201d and how it disturbed her early mornings. I felt the weight of her expectations too\u2014neighbors should keep the peace, respect shared spaces, and not let their pets become a nuisance. I stood in the hallway, torn between wanting to reassure my sister and needing to apologize to Mrs. Lee. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t meet both expectations at once. I hesitated, caught between the closed door of my sister\u2019s room and the thin wall separating us from our neighbor, unsure which role to answer first."}
