She needed me\u2014her words trembled with grief, and I could almost feel her tears through the screen. My heart ached for her, wanting nothing more than to hold her, to be her anchor as she mourned. But just then, my grandson shuffled into the room, his shoulders slumped, eyes clouded with worry. He\u2019d been so quiet lately, and I knew he was struggling with something he couldn\u2019t quite name. As his grandmother, I felt the pull to offer comfort, to share the wisdom I\u2019d gathered over the years, to help him find his way. Yet, my mind was split\u2014my partner\u2019s pain was raw and immediate, demanding my presence, while my grandson\u2019s silent plea tugged at my sense of responsibility. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting my undivided care, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of my heart to follow first."}
