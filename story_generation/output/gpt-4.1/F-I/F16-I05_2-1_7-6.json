My spouse walked in, eyes shadowed with worry, and I knew I should ask what was wrong, offer a listening ear, and share my own work frustrations. That\u2019s what we promised each other\u2014open communication, no matter how tired or busy we felt. But just as I reached for their hand, my phone buzzed with a message from my mentee. She\u2019d missed another deadline, and I could sense her confidence slipping away. As her mentor, I was supposed to encourage her, help her find strategies to manage her time, and be available when she needed support. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. My spouse needed me to be present, to talk and listen, but my mentee needed guidance right now, before she lost faith in herself. My heart ached as I tried to decide where to turn first, feeling the pull of two worlds that both mattered deeply to me."}
