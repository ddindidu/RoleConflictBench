The home loan repayment loomed in my mind, a heavy shadow over every decision. As a mother, I felt the weight of ensuring our family\u2019s financial stability, and I knew I needed to start planning, maybe even take on extra shifts or cut back on expenses. My phone buzzed with a reminder: my mentor had asked me to reach out if I had any questions, no matter how small. I did have a question\u2014just a minor point about terminology in my latest project. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I remembered her words about open communication. Still, I hesitated. Every minute spent on a call or email felt like time stolen from budgeting, from searching for ways to stretch our income. My mind tugged in two directions: the responsible mother, laser-focused on our family\u2019s future, and the diligent mentee, eager to meet expectations and not disappoint. I stared at my phone, heart pounding, torn between the roles that defined me."}
