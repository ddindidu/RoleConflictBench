My husband and I had just started a serious conversation about our finances\u2014something we\u2019d been putting off for weeks. He looked at me, waiting for my response to his question about our savings, his eyes searching for honesty and reassurance. But the phone kept vibrating. I glanced at the screen: it was my best friend, calling again. I could imagine her curled up on her couch, tears streaming down her face, needing me to listen, to be there for her like I always promised I would. My husband\u2019s voice softened, \u201cCan we finish this? I need to know we\u2019re on the same page.\u201d My heart twisted. I wanted to be the open, supportive wife he needed, but I also couldn\u2019t ignore my friend\u2019s pain. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, torn between answering the call and staying present in the conversation that mattered so much to my marriage."}
