My mom looked at me, her eyes hopeful, \u201cYou\u2019ll come with us to the lake, right? We haven\u2019t all been together in ages.\u201d I knew how much it meant to them, especially after how busy I\u2019d been lately. But as I reached for my phone, I saw a message from Mia: \u201cCan we talk? I had a rough day.\u201d I remembered how crushed she sounded on the phone earlier, her voice trembling as she told me about the feedback from her boss. She needed me, needed someone to listen and reassure her. My family\u2019s laughter filled the room, but my mind was with Mia, picturing her alone in her apartment, replaying every harsh word. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my family\u2019s expectation to be present, and Mia\u2019s need for comfort. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be the brother they wanted and the boyfriend she needed, knowing I couldn\u2019t be both at the same time."}
