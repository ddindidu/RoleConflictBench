They wanted me to come in immediately to discuss what happened. My mind raced with worry and guilt\u2014how could I not be there for him now, when he needed guidance and support? But as I glanced at my calendar, dread crept in. In less than an hour, I was supposed to join a crucial team meeting at work, one that would cover project updates I couldn\u2019t afford to miss. My manager had stressed the importance of everyone\u2019s presence, and my teammates were counting on my input. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My child needed me as a parent, but my team needed me as a colleague. I sat at my desk, phone in hand, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
