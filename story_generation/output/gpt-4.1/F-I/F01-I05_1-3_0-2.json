I need advice before tomorrow\u2019s big decision.\u201d I glanced up to see my granddaughter, Emma, hesitating in the doorway, her eyes searching mine. \u201cGrandpa, can I ask you something?\u201d she said softly. She was on the brink of high school, nervous about friendships and choices ahead. She wanted reassurance, a gentle nudge from someone who\u2019d seen it all. At the same time, my mentee expected a thorough, analytical discussion\u2014charts, pros and cons, a roadmap for success. Emma needed warmth and stories; my mentee needed precision and strategy. Both looked to me for guidance, but the demands felt worlds apart. My heart ached, torn between the urge to wrap Emma in comfort and the responsibility to steer my mentee with clarity. I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing in, each pulling me in a different direction, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which role to step into first."}
