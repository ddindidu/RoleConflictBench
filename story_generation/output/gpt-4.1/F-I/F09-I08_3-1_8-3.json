The home loan repayment loomed just two months away, and every dollar counted. I needed to make sure we\u2019d have enough, so I was carefully planning our expenses, cutting out anything unnecessary. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was Priya, an old acquaintance from college. She was in town and wanted a recommendation for a good restaurant nearby. She mentioned she was hoping for something special, maybe a place I\u2019d been to recently. I knew she valued my opinion and was counting on me to help her out. But the truth was, I hadn\u2019t eaten out in months, not since we started saving for the loan. I felt a pang of guilt\u2014should I admit I couldn\u2019t help because of our tight budget, or should I try to recall a place from memory, risking giving her a less-than-great suggestion? The weight of being a responsible mother clashed with the simple expectation of being a helpful acquaintance, and I felt torn, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
