My sister was telling a story, and laughter filled the room. I knew how much these gatherings meant to everyone, especially our parents, who always insisted that we all be present, no matter how busy life got. Just as I was about to join in, my phone buzzed with a message from an acquaintance I\u2019d met through work. He was at a nearby caf\u00e9 with a few others, and he wanted to talk. I excused myself for a moment and stepped outside to call him back.\n\nHe launched into a rant about a colleague, criticizing her recent project and hinting that I must have noticed her mistakes too. I felt uncomfortable. As an acquaintance, I knew I was expected to avoid gossip and not speak ill of others, but he seemed to want my agreement. At the same time, I could hear my family calling me back inside, expecting me to be present and engaged. I stood there, torn between the warmth of my family and the pressure from my acquaintance, feeling the weight of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
