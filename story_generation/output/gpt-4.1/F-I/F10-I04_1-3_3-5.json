Every year, we gathered around the table, shared stories, and celebrated our heritage. My mom had spent days preparing, and I knew how much it meant to her that I was there, upholding the values and customs she\u2019d worked so hard to pass down. As I was helping set the table, my phone buzzed with a frantic call from my best friend, Mia. Her voice trembled\u2014her car had broken down on the highway, miles away, and she was alone, scared, and needed me to come get her right away. My heart pounded. I could hear my family laughing in the next room, waiting for me to join them, while Mia\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, desperate for help. I felt torn in two, the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing down on me, while the loyalty and urgency of friendship pulled me in the opposite direction. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, phone in the other, caught between the daughter I was raised to be and the friend I promised I\u2019d always be."}
