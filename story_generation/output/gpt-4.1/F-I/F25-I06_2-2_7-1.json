The deadline was in three days, and I knew she expected me to show real progress. But from the living room, I could hear my stepdad\u2019s voice, low and tired, and my mom\u2019s sighs as she shuffled through bills. They\u2019d both seemed so worn out lately, barely talking at dinner, their faces drawn with worry. I knew I should go out there, sit with them, maybe make some tea or just listen\u2014be the support they needed, the step-child who helped hold things together.\n\nBut every minute I spent away from my laptop was another minute lost on the code sample, another chance to disappoint my mentor, who\u2019d told me how important it was to meet deadlines and show initiative. My chest tightened as I glanced between the glowing screen and the hallway. I wanted to be there for my parents, to ease their burden, but I also wanted to prove myself to my mentor. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, torn between the two worlds that needed me."}
