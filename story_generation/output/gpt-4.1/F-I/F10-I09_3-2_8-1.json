As I set it on the counter, my mom called me into the living room. Her eyes were red, and my dad sat beside her, silent and tense. She started talking about how hard the move had been for them, how lonely she felt, and how much she missed our old home. I could see she needed me to listen, to comfort her, to be the daughter she could lean on. My heart ached for her, and I wanted nothing more than to sit and hold her hand.\n\nBut just then, through the window, I saw our next-door neighbor step onto their porch. This was the perfect chance to introduce myself, to be the friendly, polite neighbor everyone expects in a new community. I glanced at the cake, then back at my parents. I felt torn, the weight of their sadness pulling me one way, and the pressure to make a good impression tugging me the other. My chest tightened as I stood there, caught between being the daughter my parents needed and the neighbor I was supposed to be."}
