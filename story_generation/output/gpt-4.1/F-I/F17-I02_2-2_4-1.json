She\u2019d just gotten some harsh feedback at work, and her words were heavy with disappointment. I wanted to be there for her, to listen and reassure her, but my parents were bustling around, preparing for the family dinner. They\u2019d been talking all week about how important it was to honor our traditions, especially tonight, and I could see the pride in their eyes as they set the table with my grandmother\u2019s old china. My mom called me over to help, reminding me how much it meant to her that I was present, not just physically but emotionally, upholding what our family stood for. My phone vibrated again\u2014my girlfriend needed me, too. I felt torn, the weight of my family\u2019s expectations pressing on one side, and the pull of my girlfriend\u2019s pain tugging on the other. My heart raced as I tried to figure out how to be the son my parents wanted and the boyfriend my partner needed, both at the same time."}
