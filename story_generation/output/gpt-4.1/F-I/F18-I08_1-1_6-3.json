Mom always reminded me to look out for him, and I took that seriously. Suddenly, my phone buzzed. It was Jamie, a classmate I didn\u2019t know well, asking if I could recommend a good restaurant nearby for her family\u2019s dinner. She sounded a bit desperate\u2014her parents were already on their way and she didn\u2019t want to disappoint them. I felt the urge to help, not wanting to seem rude or unhelpful. But as I started typing a reply, my brother darted ahead, chasing after a stray cat. My heart pounded. I knew I should keep my focus on him, but Jamie was waiting for my answer. I stood there, torn, phone in hand, glancing between my brother and the screen, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
