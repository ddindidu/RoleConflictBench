My stepbrother nudged me, grinning, \u201cYou\u2019re coming to the lake with us, right? It\u2019s been ages since we all did something together.\u201d I could feel everyone\u2019s eyes on me, waiting for my answer, and I knew how much it meant to them\u2014especially since I\u2019d missed the last few family outings.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket. A message from Mia: \u201cCan\u2019t wait for tomorrow night. Miss you already.\u201d My heart twisted. Tomorrow was the only evening we both had free before she left for her conference, and we\u2019d been looking forward to it for weeks. She needed me, too\u2014her texts lately had been full of stress and longing.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting, the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. My family expected me to be present, to help us feel more like a real unit. Mia expected me to show her she was my priority, especially now. I stared at my plate, torn, wishing I could be in two places at once, knowing I\u2019d disappoint someone no matter what I chose."}
