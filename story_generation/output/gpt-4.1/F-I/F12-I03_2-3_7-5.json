I knew he was worried about work, and as his wife, I felt the weight of expectation to reach out, to ask him what was wrong, to share my own anxieties so we could face them together. But my phone buzzed with a message from Alex\u2014my boyfriend\u2014reminding me that this was our last weekend together before he left for months. He wanted to make every moment count, to laugh and hold hands and forget the looming distance. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. My husband needed my honesty and support, but Alex needed my presence, my undivided attention. I could feel the pressure mounting, the guilt of not being enough for either of them. I stared at the clock, knowing I had to choose where to be, but unable to move, caught between the roles I\u2019d chosen and the people I cared about."}
