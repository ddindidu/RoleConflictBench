My wife was in the kitchen, her voice trembling as she told me about the ultimatum her boss had given her. She needed me\u2014needed my reassurance, my advice, the steady presence I promised when we married. I could hear the expectation in her voice, the hope that I\u2019d help her see a way through.\n\nBut my phone kept buzzing. My girlfriend\u2019s name flashed on the screen. We\u2019d fought three times this week about money\u2014her frustration with my spending, my defensiveness. She wanted to talk, to finally resolve things, and I knew if I ignored her again, it would only get worse. She expected me to step up, to fix what was broken between us.\n\nI felt split in two, my heart pounding with guilt and anxiety. I wanted to be there for both of them, to meet their needs, but the demands pulled me in opposite directions. I stared at the phone, my wife\u2019s voice in the background, my girlfriend\u2019s messages piling up, and I didn\u2019t know which way to turn."}
