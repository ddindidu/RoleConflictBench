My younger brother was curled up on the couch, his eyes red from crying over his looming final exam. I knew he needed me\u2014he always counted on me to talk him through his anxiety, to remind him he was capable. But my phone buzzed again: another message from my mentor, asking for an update on the group project. The truth was, my teammates and I had hit a wall, arguing over every detail, and now the deadline was at risk. I was supposed to be honest with my mentor, to let her know when things weren\u2019t going well, but I hadn\u2019t found the words yet. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my brother\u2019s shaky voice calling for comfort, my mentor\u2019s expectation for transparency weighing on me. My chest tightened as I tried to decide who needed me more in this moment, and whether I could possibly be enough for both."}
