The home loan repayment was looming, and I needed to make sure every cent was accounted for. My mind raced with worries\u2014school fees, groceries, the electricity bill. I couldn\u2019t afford to make a mistake. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was Sam, my oldest friend. His voice trembled as he asked if I had a moment. He\u2019d just had a huge fight with his partner and needed someone to talk to. I could hear the pain in his words, the expectation that I\u2019d listen, like I always had. But my own anxiety was mounting, the weight of my family\u2019s needs pressing down on me. I wanted to be there for Sam, to offer the support he counted on, but the thought of losing focus on the finances made my chest tighten. I sat there, phone in hand, torn between being the friend Sam needed and the father my family depended on, feeling the two worlds pull me in opposite directions."}
