I knew she liked to feel included, especially since we were still building our relationship. I started typing a reply, trying to remember every detail she\u2019d want to hear. Just then, my best friend called, her voice shaky. She\u2019d just opened the box for her new bookshelf, and the instructions made no sense. \u201cCan you hop on a video call? I really need your help,\u201d she pleaded. I glanced at the clock\u2014if I didn\u2019t answer my stepmom soon, she\u2019d worry or feel ignored. But my friend sounded desperate, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d always be there for her, especially after her rough week. My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between the two conversations, feeling the pressure of not wanting to let either of them down."}
