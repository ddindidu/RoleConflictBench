It was a text from Mia, my best friend: \u201cCan we talk? I\u2019m really upset about what you said earlier.\u201d My heart dropped. I remembered the offhand comment I\u2019d made at lunch, not realizing it had stung her so deeply. I knew I needed to call her right away, to explain and apologize, just like we always promised we would.\n\nBut tonight was my little brother\u2019s graduation party, and he\u2019d been looking forward to this for weeks. As his sister, I was supposed to be there, cheering him on, making him feel special. My mom was already calling for me to help bring out the cake. I could see my brother\u2019s excited face, waiting for me to join the celebration. At the same time, Mia\u2019s message weighed on me\u2014I couldn\u2019t leave her hurting, not when she needed me to be a good friend.\n\nI stood frozen, torn between the living room and my phone, feeling the pressure of both worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
