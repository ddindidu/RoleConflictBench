My family was already gathered around the dinner table, laughter and the clatter of dishes echoing from the dining room. Mom had made it clear\u2014tonight was important, a rare evening when everyone was home. I was supposed to be there, present, part of the family. But my mind kept drifting to the text from my friend, the one that made my stomach drop. I hadn\u2019t realized my joke had cut so deep until I saw their message, raw and hurt. I knew I needed to call, to explain, to apologize before things got worse. But if I left the table now, I\u2019d disappoint my family, maybe even hurt them too. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. My phone buzzed again, and I could hear my name being called from the dining room. I stood frozen, torn between the people I loved, unsure which role to answer first."}
