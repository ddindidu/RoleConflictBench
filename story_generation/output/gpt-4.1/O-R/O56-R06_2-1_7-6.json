As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before I start, especially when it\u2019s like this. It\u2019s part of my job to make sure everything is clean and fresh, for both hygiene and the best results. But as I led her to the chair, she looked tired and mentioned she was in a rush, hoping for a quick trim before picking up her kids. My heart tugged\u2014my faith teaches me to show kindness and understanding, to make people feel cared for, not judged or inconvenienced. I could see she needed a little grace today, maybe just a small gesture of compassion. But the rules at the salon are clear, and my professional standards matter too. I stood there, torn between the gentle teachings of my faith and the expectations of my job, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
