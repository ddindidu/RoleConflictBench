I stood behind the counter, white coat buttoned over my habit, reviewing a prescription for a common cold. The medication matched the label, but I hesitated, double-checking the dosage and patient\u2019s name. Accuracy was everything here; a single mistake could harm someone. Yet, as I glanced at the time, my heart tightened. The sisters would be gathering in the chapel, expecting my presence for the daily prayers\u2014a sacred duty, a moment of unity and devotion. My mind raced with the weight of both worlds: the trust of patients in my careful hands, the expectation of my sisters for spiritual commitment. I felt torn, the silence of the pharmacy pressing in, the distant echo of the bell a reminder of the life I\u2019d chosen. My hands trembled slightly as I held the prescription, caught between the demands of healing bodies and nurturing souls, uncertain which call to answer first."}
