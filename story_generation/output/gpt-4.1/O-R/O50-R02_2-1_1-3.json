The supervisor hovered nearby, his voice tight: \u201cWe\u2019re losing thousands every minute. Can you fix it?\u201d I nodded, already tracing wires, my mind racing through possible causes for the sensor errors. My phone vibrated in my pocket. Glancing at the screen, I saw a message from Mrs. Linton, a parishioner. \u201cHi, Father, could we talk sometime soon? I\u2019m struggling.\u201d I felt a pang of guilt. As a priest, I was supposed to be available, a steady presence for those in need. But right now, the factory\u2019s demands were urgent, the pressure immense. I could almost hear the silent expectation from both worlds: fix the machine, be there for your flock.
