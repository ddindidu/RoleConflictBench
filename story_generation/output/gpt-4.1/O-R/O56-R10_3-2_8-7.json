She needed a deep cleanse and careful detangling before I could even think about cutting, but the process would take at least another hour. My heart thudded with anxiety. Today was the day of my cousin\u2019s wedding ceremony, and as a Hindu, my presence was not just expected\u2014it was essential. I was supposed to arrive early, dressed in my best sari, to help with the rituals and greet the elders. My mother had called twice already, reminding me not to be late. But here I was, hands deep in suds, knowing I couldn\u2019t rush this client without compromising my work. The salon\u2019s expectations pressed on me: every client deserves my full attention and skill. Yet, the weight of my family\u2019s traditions and the importance of the ceremony pulled me in the opposite direction. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between my professional pride and my cultural duty, unsure which demand I could afford to disappoint."}
