My headset itches against my ear, and the phone queue is still packed\u2014management\u2019s emails about break adherence and productivity flash through my mind. I know I\u2019m supposed to log out exactly on time, but the supervisor\u2019s eyes are always on the break logs, and I can almost feel the pressure to stay on the line just a little longer.\n\nBut tonight is our weekly study slot with my kids. I promised them we\u2019d talk about the story of Ruth, and I want to show them how our traditions carry meaning, how our values shape who we are. I know I could shift the lesson to another night, but I also know how much it means to them\u2014and to me\u2014to keep this time sacred, to pass on what matters most.\n\nMy finger hovers over the break button. The demands of my job and my faith pull at me from opposite sides, and I feel the tension coil in my chest. I want to be reliable at work, but I also want to be the parent my children need."}
