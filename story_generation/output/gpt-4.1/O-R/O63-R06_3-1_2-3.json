You people always call at the worst times!\u201d His voice was sharp, demanding answers I was trained to provide, no matter how tough the objection. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNever let a customer go without trying to win them back.\u201d I took a deep breath, ready to explain every detail, to reassure him, to do my job.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I realized Sunday service was starting. My church family would be singing, praying, and sharing in the warmth of community\u2014something I\u2019d missed for weeks. I felt a pang of guilt. As a Christian, I was expected to be present, to worship, to serve. Yet here I was, tethered to my headset, torn between my duty to my job and my longing to reconnect with my faith. My heart raced as I weighed the demands, caught between the voice on the line and the call in my soul."}
