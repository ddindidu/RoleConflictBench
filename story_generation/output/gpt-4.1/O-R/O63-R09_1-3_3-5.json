My manager\u2019s praise echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cYou\u2019re on track to break the weekly record!\u201d\u2014and I felt the familiar pressure to keep the momentum going. The company had organized this lunch to celebrate our team\u2019s success, and the spread was impressive: platters of sandwiches, salads, and pastries, all laid out for us. But as I scanned the table, my heart sank. None of the food had kosher certification. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice reminding me of the importance of keeping kosher, of honoring our family\u2019s traditions. My colleagues nudged me, urging me to dig in, to celebrate with them. I knew refusing might make me seem ungrateful or distant, maybe even risk the camaraderie that helped me thrive at work. But eating would mean compromising a core part of my identity. I stared at the food, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which part of myself I could afford to disappoint."}
