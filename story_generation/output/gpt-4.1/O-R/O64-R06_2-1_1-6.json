My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cAccuracy is everything. No mistakes.\u201d I focus on each barcode, double-checking prices, but the pressure mounts with every sigh from the waiting crowd. Then, an elderly woman steps up, fumbling with her coins, her hands trembling. She apologizes softly, her eyes darting to the restless people behind her. As a cashier, I know I should keep the line moving, process her transaction swiftly, and avoid holding up the queue. But as a Christian, I feel a tug in my heart to show her patience and kindness, to offer a reassuring smile and gentle words, even if it means slowing down. The tension inside me grows\u2014do I rush her along to meet my job\u2019s demands, or do I pause to treat her with the compassion my faith calls me to show? The weight of both expectations presses on me as I stand at the register, caught between efficiency and empathy, unsure which path to take."}
