Every few seconds, I counted heads, watching for the slightest sign of distress. My mind, though, kept drifting to the blank page in my notebook, tucked in my bag by the first aid kit. Shabbat was weeks away, but I knew the congregation expected a thoughtful, inspiring sermon. I needed to start brainstorming now, to let the ideas simmer and grow. \n\nBut as I tried to focus on possible Torah portions and relevant themes, a sudden splash jolted me back. A swimmer in the middle lane was floundering, their strokes uneven. My training screamed at me to stay alert, to be ready to leap in at any moment. Yet, the pressure to fulfill my spiritual responsibilities tugged at me, whispering that I was falling behind. I felt torn, my heart pounding with the weight of both roles, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
