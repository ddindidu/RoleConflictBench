As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: drive defensively, obey every traffic law, especially in weather like this. Cars darted in and out of lanes, brake lights flaring unpredictably. My hands gripped the wheel tighter, heart pounding with every sudden stop ahead. But my phone buzzed on the passenger seat\u2014a message from the parish office. The Martinez family needed me to lead a last-minute preparation session for their daughter\u2019s sacrament, tonight, no exceptions. As their priest, I was expected to guide them, to be present, to ensure their child was ready for this sacred milestone. I glanced at the clock. If I took the highway, I might just make it in time, but the roads were treacherous and the speed limit strict. My mind raced, torn between my duty to keep my passengers and myself safe, and my responsibility to my parishioners who counted on me for spiritual guidance. The rain kept falling, and I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me, unsure which path to choose."}
