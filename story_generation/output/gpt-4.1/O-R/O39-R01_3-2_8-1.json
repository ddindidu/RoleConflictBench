As a construction laborer, I knew the rules\u2014no hesitation, no questions, just get to the muster point. My foreman\u2019s eyes swept the site, counting heads, making sure no one lagged behind. But as I turned to leave, I felt a tug on my sleeve. It was Marcus, a young electrician from my church, his face pale and desperate. \u201cPastor, I need you,\u201d he whispered, voice trembling. \u201cI can\u2019t wait. I don\u2019t know what to do about my wife\u2014she\u2019s leaving, and I\u2019m lost.\u201d \n\nEvery instinct as a pastor screamed at me to stay, to listen, to offer the comfort and guidance he needed in this moment of crisis. But the foreman\u2019s shout echoed across the site, and I saw the rest of the crew already moving away. If I stayed, I\u2019d be breaking protocol, risking my job and safety. If I left, I\u2019d be abandoning someone who trusted me with his pain. My feet felt rooted to the spot, torn between the hard hat and the collar, the rules of the site and the call of the soul."}
