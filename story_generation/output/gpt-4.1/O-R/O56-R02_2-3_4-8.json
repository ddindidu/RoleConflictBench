She frowned, lips pressed tight, and I knew instantly the colour wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d hoped for. My heart thudded\u2014client satisfaction was everything, and I prided myself on making people feel beautiful. I wanted to fix it, to listen, to reassure her that we could adjust the tone. But as I reached for a towel, my phone buzzed in my pocket. A message from the parish: the Martinez family needed me to lead a last-minute sacrament preparation for their daughter. The session was non-negotiable, the sacrament only days away, and I was the only priest available. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my client\u2019s anxious eyes searching mine for answers, the church expecting my unwavering presence. I stood there, hands trembling, torn between the chair and the altar, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
