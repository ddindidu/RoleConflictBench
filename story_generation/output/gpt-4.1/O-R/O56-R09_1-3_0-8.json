She smiles, expecting the usual warm greeting and a few minutes of friendly banter before her appointment. The receptionist is at her desk, scrolling through her phone, but I know Mrs. Feldman prefers when I greet her personally. I start to move toward her, but my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from the synagogue: they need one more person for the minyan to say Kaddish at a funeral, and the service starts in fifteen minutes. My heart pounds. I know how important it is to comfort the mourners, to be present for the prayer, but I also know Mrs. Feldman looks forward to our chats, and I don\u2019t want her to feel unwelcome or neglected. I stand frozen, caught between the warmth of my salon and the solemn call of my faith, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
