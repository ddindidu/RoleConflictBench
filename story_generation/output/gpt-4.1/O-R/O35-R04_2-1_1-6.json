The radio crackled\u2014there was a minor delay at the next station. I needed to adjust the speed, keep the train on schedule, and make sure no one was jolted by sudden stops. My hands gripped the controls, mind calculating the safest way to handle the delay. Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket. Earlier, after Friday prayers, a brother from the community had mentioned he was struggling and would appreciate some advice whenever I had a moment. As an imam, I knew how much it meant for someone to reach out, and I felt the weight of his unspoken need. But now, as the subway operator, I was responsible for hundreds of lives, every second demanding my full attention. The train rumbled forward, and I felt torn\u2014my duty to my passengers clashing with my responsibility to offer guidance. The expectation to be present for my community pressed against the immediate need to ensure everyone\u2019s safety. My heart pounded as I wrestled with which role to answer first, the train\u2019s steady rhythm echoing my inner turmoil."}
