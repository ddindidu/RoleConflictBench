Users were frustrated, and QA was escalating the issue\u2014my team needed answers, and fast. I knew I should dive into the code, trace the elusive bug, and reassure everyone that a fix was on the way. But as I reached for my coffee, my phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: \u201cBegin sermon prep\u2014Shabbat in three weeks.\u201d My congregation expected thoughtful, inspiring words, and I prided myself on never recycling old messages. The pressure to deliver something meaningful weighed on me, especially with the High Holidays approaching. I felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions\u2014one toward the urgent demands of my job, the other toward the spiritual needs of my community. I closed my eyes, feeling the tension knot in my chest, wondering how I could possibly meet both expectations without letting someone down."}
