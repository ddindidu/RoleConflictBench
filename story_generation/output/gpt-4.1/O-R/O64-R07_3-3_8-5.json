My hands move quickly, scanning items, offering practiced smiles. A customer slams her basket down, voice sharp, accusing me of overcharging. I feel the heat rise in my cheeks, but I remember the store\u2019s motto: \u201cFriendly service, always.\u201d I apologize, double-check her receipt, and try to keep my tone gentle, even as she mutters under her breath. My mind flickers to the clock\u2014my meditation group meets in twenty minutes, and I\u2019m supposed to lead today\u2019s session. I promised to guide everyone in mindfulness, to be a calm presence, but I\u2019m trapped behind the register, heart pounding, breath shallow. I want to be patient, to embody compassion, but the demands of the holiday rush pull me in one direction, while my commitment to my Buddhist practice tugs me in another. I can\u2019t leave the line, but I can\u2019t let my group down either. The stress tightens in my chest as I weigh my responsibilities, caught between the expectations of my job and my spiritual path."}
