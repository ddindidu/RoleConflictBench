My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cMove those materials before you leave today.\u201d I nodded, knowing the job had to be done, but my thoughts kept drifting to the small temple room across town. Every week, I lead our meditation group, guiding others in mindfulness and stillness. Tonight was our session, and I was expected to be there, calm and centered, to help others find peace.\n\nBut the pile of unused materials loomed large, and the clock ticked on. If I left now, the work would be unfinished, and I\u2019d let my team down. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the meditation, disappointing my fellow practitioners and betraying my own commitment to the path. My muscles ached, my mind raced, and I felt torn between the demands of the world and the call of inner stillness. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood there, caught between bricks and breath, unsure which duty to honor."}
