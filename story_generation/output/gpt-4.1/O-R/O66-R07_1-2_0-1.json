Tonight\u2019s memorial service was important\u2014my teacher had asked me to help prepare the incense and greet the elders. But as a taxi driver, I had a job to do, and my next passenger slid into the back seat with a relaxed smile, mentioning he was just heading to a casual dinner, no rush at all. I nodded, but my heart thudded with anxiety. If I took him now, I\u2019d be late for the ceremony, letting down my sangha and missing a chance to honor the departed. But if I refused the fare, I\u2019d break my promise to provide safe, timely rides, and maybe lose a regular customer. The meter ticked, the temple bell echoed in my memory, and I sat gripping the wheel, torn between the world\u2019s demands and the path I\u2019d chosen."}
