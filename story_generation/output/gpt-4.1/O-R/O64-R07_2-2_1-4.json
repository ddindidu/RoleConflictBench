My fingers move quickly over the keys, scanning barcodes, counting change, trying not to make a mistake. The store manager glances over, reminding me to keep the line moving. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014every second counts, every error means a delay, and the customers\u2019 sighs grow louder. But my phone vibrates in my pocket, a gentle reminder: the weekly meditation group starts in ten minutes. I promised myself I\u2019d be there, to sit in stillness, to breathe, to let go of the day\u2019s chaos. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to cultivate mindfulness, to be present and calm, but here I am, heart racing, mind scattered, tethered to the register. I glance at the clock, torn between the demands of my job and the commitment to my practice. The queue doesn\u2019t shrink, and neither does the knot in my stomach. I wonder if I can be both the diligent cashier and the mindful Buddhist, or if, today, I must choose."}
