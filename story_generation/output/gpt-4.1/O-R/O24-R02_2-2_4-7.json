As a judge, I was expected to write a clear, detailed judgment\u2014thirty days was the deadline, and the parties deserved a thorough, reasoned decision. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the children gathering in the parish hall, waiting for their weekly religious education class. As their priest, I was responsible for guiding them, answering their questions, and nurturing their faith. Both roles demanded my full attention, my best self. I felt the weight of the court\u2019s expectation for precision and timeliness, and the parish\u2019s need for warmth and presence. My mind raced with legal arguments and lesson plans, my heart torn between justice and compassion. I knew I could not be in two places at once, and the pressure of choosing which duty to fulfill pressed down on me, heavy and unresolved."}
