The hospital was already buzzing, and I knew I had to take and record Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s vital signs before the shift change. As I reached her door, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from my spouse: \u201cHe\u2019s struggling with his Torah portion. Can you come home early to help him before his bar mitzvah?\u201d My heart clenched. I\u2019d promised my son I\u2019d help him practice, to guide him through the words and melodies that meant so much to our family and faith. But here I was, needed by my patients, expected to be thorough and attentive, to not miss a single detail in their care. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my duty to my patients, and my responsibility to my son, to our tradition. I stood in the doorway, torn, the beeping monitors and the echo of ancient prayers both calling my name."}
