New drugs, new protocols\u2014my mind raced to keep up. It was my responsibility to stay current, to ensure my patients\u2019 safety. My phone buzzed. It was Miriam from the synagogue. Her voice trembled as she told me that Mr. Goldstein had passed away. The family needed me to officiate the funeral, and soon. I felt the weight of their grief, the expectation that I would guide them through this moment, offer comfort, and uphold tradition. But I was already behind on my professional reading, and the pharmacy was short-staffed today. My heart pounded as I stared at the newsletter, then at my phone. Both roles demanded my full presence, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The pressure built inside me, a knot of duty and guilt, as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
