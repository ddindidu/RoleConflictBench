As a lifeguard, I\u2019m expected to keep everything in order, so I did my usual walk around the deck. A few pool chairs were out of line, not dangerously so, but enough that I knew my supervisor would want them straightened. I bent down to adjust one, my stomach rumbling. I hadn\u2019t eaten since dawn, and I remembered the kosher snacks I\u2019d packed in my bag. The break room was just inside, but I knew I couldn\u2019t eat on the deck\u2014rules were rules, and food wasn\u2019t allowed near the pool. Still, the hunger gnawed at me, and I thought about how easy it would be to sneak a quick bite while I worked. But then I remembered the importance of keeping kosher, not just what I ate, but how and where I ate it. The expectation to maintain the pool\u2019s order pressed against the rituals that shaped my daily life. I stood there, pool chair in hand, torn between the demands of my job and the quiet discipline of my faith, unsure which expectation I should honor first."}
