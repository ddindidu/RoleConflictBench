A sudden route closure has forced dozens of flights into tight holding stacks, and my voice is calm but my heart pounds. Every instruction I give could mean the difference between order and chaos. The expectation is clear: keep the skies safe, manage the congestion, don\u2019t let a single mistake slip through.\n\nBut my phone vibrates with a message from the convent. The Mother Superior\u2019s request echoes in my mind\u2014she wants me to lead daily reflections for the upcoming retreat. It\u2019s an honor, a responsibility to guide my sisters in spiritual study, to be present, centered, and prayerful. Yet, as I scan the radar, my thoughts are split. How can I offer peace and guidance when my mind is tethered to the relentless demands of the tower? The weight of both worlds presses in, and I feel myself pulled apart, torn between the urgent needs of the sky and the quiet call of faith."}
