My headset crackled with pilots\u2019 anxious voices, each one relying on me to keep them safe as the sudden route closure forced everyone into tight holding patterns. My mind raced, calculating altitudes, fuel limits, and the safest sequence for landing. Every second mattered. Then my phone vibrated. It was Brother Yusuf, a long-time congregant. His message was urgent: \u201cImam, I need to talk. My family is falling apart. Please, can you meet soon?\u201d I could hear the desperation in his words, the kind of pain that can\u2019t wait. My community expected me to be present, to offer comfort and guidance, especially in moments like this. But right now, dozens of lives depended on my focus and precision. My heart pounded as I stared at the radar, torn between the chaos in the sky and the turmoil in Yusuf\u2019s home. Both roles demanded all of me, right now, and I felt myself pulled in two, unable to give either the attention they deserved."}
