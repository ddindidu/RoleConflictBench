She clutched my arm, desperate for comfort, and I could see she needed more than a polite word. As a pastor, I knew I should offer her my full attention, listen deeply, and guide her through her pain. But as a cleaner, I was acutely aware of the protocols\u2014never touch anyone without fresh gloves, never let your guard down with hygiene, especially now. My supervisor had just reminded us of the risks, and I could feel the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest. Mrs. Lee\u2019s hand tightened, pleading for spiritual support, while my mind raced with reminders of safety and the rules I was sworn to uphold. I stood there, torn between the urge to comfort her as a pastor and the duty to protect us both as a cleaner, my heart pounding with the impossible choice."}
