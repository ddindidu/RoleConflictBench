A colleague, Mark, leaned in, lowering his voice. \u201cHey, I heard you\u2019re representing that young woman from the shelter. Is it true what they\u2019re saying about her situation?\u201d His tone was casual, but I could sense genuine concern. I remembered the confidentiality oath I\u2019d taken as a lawyer\u2014my client\u2019s trust depended on my silence. Yet, as a Christian, I felt the tug to show compassion, to offer comfort or guidance, especially since Mark seemed worried about her well-being. My heart ached to reassure him, to share something that might ease his mind or help him support her. But the weight of my professional duty pressed down, warning me that even a hint could betray my client\u2019s privacy. I stood there, caught between the sacred trust of my profession and the call to love my neighbor, my words frozen as I wrestled with what to say."}
