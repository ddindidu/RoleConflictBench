I had been looking forward to the weekly meditation, a rare hour of stillness with my sangha, a time to nurture mindfulness and let go of the week\u2019s chaos. But now, duty called. I pictured the patient, pain etched on their face, waiting for help that only I could bring. My training as an ambulance driver demanded swift action, calm under pressure, and the ability to provide comfort and care. Yet, as a Buddhist, I was taught to be present, to honor commitments, and to cultivate inner peace. The siren\u2019s wail echoed in my mind, clashing with the gentle chime of the meditation bell. I felt torn, my heart pulled between the suffering of another and my own need for spiritual nourishment. The clock ticked, and I sat in the driver\u2019s seat, wrestling with the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
