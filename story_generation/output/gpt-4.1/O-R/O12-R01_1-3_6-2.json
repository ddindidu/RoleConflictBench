The UI glitch was minor, but the product manager\u2019s email was clear: \u201cPlease fix ASAP\u2014users are frustrated.\u201d I knew the workaround, but I also knew the expectation\u2014swift, thorough solutions. My phone buzzed. It was Sarah, her message urgent: \u201cCan we talk? I\u2019m at a breaking point.\u201d As her pastor, I\u2019d promised to be there, especially in moments like this. Her choices tonight could change her life. My mind raced. If I ignored the bug, I\u2019d let my team and users down. If I delayed Sarah, I\u2019d fail her when she needed spiritual guidance most.
