The foreman\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cKeep it moving, don\u2019t slow the crew down.\u201d The carpenter was waiting, tapping his foot, eyes darting to his watch. I knew every minute I delayed meant the whole project slowed, and I didn\u2019t want to be the reason for anyone\u2019s frustration.\n\nAs I rounded the corner, I saw one of the new guys, Miguel, struggling to lift a heavy bucket of nails. He looked exhausted, his face flushed in the midday sun. My heart tugged at me\u2014my faith taught me to help, to show kindness, to be the hands and feet of Jesus in small, everyday ways. But the lumber was heavy, and the carpenter was waiting. If I stopped to help Miguel, I\u2019d be letting the crew down. If I walked past, I\u2019d be ignoring the call to love my neighbor. My hands tightened on the wood, torn between the demands of the job and the quiet voice inside urging me to act with compassion."}
