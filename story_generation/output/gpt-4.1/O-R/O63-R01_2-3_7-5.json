My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cStick to your break schedule. We can\u2019t afford to lose a single call.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014my break was in ten minutes, and I knew I\u2019d be watched. But then my phone buzzed with a message from the church deacon: \u201cA family just lost their home in the fire. They need you now.\u201d My heart clenched. As their pastor, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and guidance in their darkest hour. But as a telemarketer, I was expected to stay at my desk, to keep dialing, to not let the team down. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the demands of compassion and corporate efficiency pulling me in opposite directions. My hands trembled as I hovered over the break request button, torn between duty and devotion, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
