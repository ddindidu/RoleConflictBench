The expectation was clear: be alert, be fast, save lives. As I sipped my coffee, my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Carter, a longtime parishioner. She asked if I might have time soon to talk\u2014nothing urgent, just a need for guidance. As a priest, I knew the importance of being present, of listening, of offering comfort even before the crisis. I typed a gentle reply, promising to find a time, when the radio crackled: \u201cUnit 3, possible cardiac arrest, respond immediately.\u201d My heart raced. The ambulance needed me now, but so did Mrs. Carter, in a quieter, less visible way. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders\u2014one demanding speed and action, the other patience and presence. I stared at my phone, then at the flashing lights above the ambulance, torn between the urgent call of the siren and the quiet plea for spiritual care."}
