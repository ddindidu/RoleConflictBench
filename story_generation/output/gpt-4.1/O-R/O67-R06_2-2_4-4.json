It was Sunday morning, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss another service. But duty called, and here I was, kneeling beside an elderly woman cradling her arm, her face twisted in pain. I moved quickly, checking her vitals, offering gentle words, and preparing the splint. My hands worked from training, but my heart ached with guilt. I could almost hear the hymns, the pastor\u2019s voice, the warmth of my church family gathering without me. I knew my presence there mattered\u2014my faith, my community, my promise to God. Yet here, this woman needed me just as much. The clock ticked, each second a reminder of the service slipping away. I felt torn, the weight of my uniform pressing against the cross around my neck. I wanted to be in two places at once, to serve both my patient and my faith, but I knew I couldn\u2019t. The ambulance doors closed, and I sat for a moment, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
