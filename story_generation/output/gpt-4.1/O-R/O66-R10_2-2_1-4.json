As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get him to the station safely and on time, weaving through the city\u2019s chaos with practiced skill. But as I turned onto the main road, I saw a small crowd gathered by the curb. My friend Ravi was there, his voice raised, facing a group of men who were clearly treating him unfairly\u2014shouting, pushing, accusing him of something I knew he hadn\u2019t done. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act with courage and defend what is right. But my passenger\u2019s anxious face in the rearview mirror reminded me of my duty to him, to his trust in me to get him to his train. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt torn, caught between the urgency of my passenger\u2019s need and the call to help my friend."}
