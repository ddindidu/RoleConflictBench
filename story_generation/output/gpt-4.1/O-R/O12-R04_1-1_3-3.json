The product team had scheduled a big brainstorming session for the next sprint, and though it was marked as \u201coptional,\u201d I knew my input was valued. We were about to design a new feature, and my experience with cross-team projects meant I could help bridge gaps. My manager had even hinted that my presence would be appreciated, especially since the last session had gone off the rails without enough technical voices.\n\nBut Friday was also the day I delivered the Khutbah at the mosque. The community expected me to be there, to guide and inspire. This week, though, we had a guest speaker lined up\u2014someone respected, who could easily take my place if I asked. Still, I knew some congregants looked forward to my sermons, and I felt a responsibility to be present, to lead by example.\n\nI felt the tension building inside me, the pull of two worlds. Both needed me, both had valid claims. I sat at my desk, heart pounding, torn between the call of my profession and the call of my faith, unsure which expectation I would ultimately meet."}
