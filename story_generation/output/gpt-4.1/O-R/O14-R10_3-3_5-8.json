The journal\u2019s submission deadline was just hours away, and my data still needed final checks. My phone buzzed with messages from my family, reminding me of the festival rituals that would begin soon. I had traveled across the country to be here, to honor my faith and my family\u2019s expectations. The scent of incense drifted in from the courtyard, mingling with the low hum of prayers. My mother called out, her voice warm but insistent, urging me to join the preparations. I felt the weight of my lab coat and the sacred thread around my wrist\u2014symbols of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. As a scientist, I owed the truth to my work, to the integrity of my findings. As a Hindu, I owed devotion to my family and the gods. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands, torn between the glow of my laptop and the glow of the festival lamps outside."}
