As a telemarketer, I was expected to handle customer objections and questions, but today, the calls were relentless. Each prospect seemed to have a dozen technical questions, most of which the script only half-answered. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cStick to the script, don\u2019t improvise.\u201d But I could hear the frustration in the customers\u2019 voices, and it gnawed at me.\n\nBetween calls, my phone buzzed with a message from a church member. She was struggling, her words heavy with worry. As her pastor, I was expected to provide spiritual guidance, to offer comfort and hope. My heart ached to call her, to listen and pray with her. But the next call blinked on my screen, another customer waiting, another barrage of questions I wasn\u2019t supposed to answer fully.\n\nI felt torn, pulled between the demands of my job and the needs of my congregation. The headset pressed into my temple, a physical reminder of the roles I was juggling, and I wondered how I could possibly meet the expectations of both."}
