I\u2019d been looking forward to this quiet afternoon, planning to retreat to my small room at the convent for spiritual reading and reflection. As a nun, these moments of solitude and prayer were precious, a time to reconnect with my faith and purpose. Yet, as I reached for my worn prayer book, my work phone buzzed with a new call. Technically, I could take my break now, but what if the call was important? My supervisor trusted us to manage our time, but I also felt the unspoken pressure to be available, to not let the team down. My heart tugged in two directions: the sacred silence I craved, and the responsibility to my job. I sat frozen, torn between the gentle call to prayer and the persistent ring of duty, unsure which voice to answer first."}
