The nurse\u2019s voice trembled\u2014\u201cThe ventilator\u2019s failing. We need you now.\u201d My mind raced through diagnostic protocols, already picturing the blinking red codes on the life-support device. Every second mattered; a life hung in the balance, and I was the only one who could fix it. But as I reached the door, my phone buzzed. It was a reminder: Mrs. Evans was waiting in the chapel, desperate for guidance, her voice on the message raw with pain. She\u2019d confided in me, her priest, about her struggle with loss, and today was the day I\u2019d promised to help her find peace. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding my hands, the other my heart. The expectation to save a life with my skills clashed with the call to heal a soul with my presence.
