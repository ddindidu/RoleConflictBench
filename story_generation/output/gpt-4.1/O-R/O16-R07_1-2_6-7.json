My last patient, a young woman with a sore throat and fever, sits across from me, her eyes tired but hopeful. As her doctor, I know she expects a thorough exam, a clear diagnosis, and the right prescription to ease her discomfort. I listen to her symptoms, check her throat, and confirm it\u2019s likely strep. I reach for my prescription pad, but my mind drifts to the Buddhist study circle meeting tonight\u2014the one I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss. We\u2019re discussing a chapter on mindfulness, a topic I\u2019ve been eager to explore, and my friends expect my presence and participation. The clinic is running late, and I know if I take extra time with this patient, I\u2019ll miss the study circle. But if I rush, I risk overlooking something important in her care. My heart tugs in two directions: the duty to heal and the longing for spiritual growth. I sit there, pen in hand, caught between the needs of my patient and the call of my practice, unsure which path to follow."}
