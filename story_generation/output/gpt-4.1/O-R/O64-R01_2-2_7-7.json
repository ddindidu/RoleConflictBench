As a cashier, I\u2019m expected to greet each customer with a smile, scan their items quickly, and offer a kind word, even when the register beeps with every error and the clock ticks closer to my break. I nod and chat, but my mind drifts to the sermon I need to finish for Sunday. As a pastor, my congregation expects me to offer clear guidance on making ethical choices, to be a moral compass. I\u2019m supposed to teach about honesty, compassion, and integrity. But now, a customer in a hurry asks if I can \u201cforget\u201d to scan a pricey item, whispering that they\u2019re struggling this month. My heart pounds. The line grows restless behind them, and I feel the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders\u2014one demanding cheerful service, the other demanding unwavering principles. I hesitate, caught between the expectations of my job and my calling, unsure which voice to follow."}
