Her hair was damp and greasy, clinging to her forehead. As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before cutting or styling, especially when it\u2019s like this. But she looked rushed, glancing at her watch, and quietly asked if I could skip the wash this time\u2014she had an important meeting and was running late. \n\nInside, I felt the familiar tug of my other role. As a Christian, I\u2019m called to act with honesty and integrity, to do what\u2019s right even when it\u2019s inconvenient. Skipping the wash would be easier for her, but it would mean not giving her the full service she\u2019s paying for, and it might not be hygienic for my tools or fair to the next client. My mind raced with the expectations of my profession and my faith, both demanding something different from me. I stood there, comb in hand, heart pounding, caught between wanting to help her and needing to do what I believed was right."}
