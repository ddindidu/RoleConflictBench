My phone buzzed with a message from my project manager: \u201cWe\u2019re all waiting on your module. The build can\u2019t move forward until it\u2019s done.\u201d I could almost feel the weight of my team\u2019s expectations pressing down on me. At the same time, my inbox filled with reminders from the synagogue board\u2014this sermon wasn\u2019t just any message; it was the High Holiday, the one time of year when every seat would be filled, every ear tuned to my words. I knew how much the congregation needed inspiration, especially this year. My mind raced, torn between the urgent technical challenge and the spiritual responsibility. I felt my heart pounding, anxiety rising as I tried to focus, but the demands of both worlds pulled me in opposite directions. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice: deliver the code my team needed, or the sermon my community expected."}
