The supervisor\u2019s sudden entrance into the cabin sent a jolt through me\u2014clipboard in hand, eyes sharp, ready to scrutinize every move. I straightened, recalling every protocol drilled into me: precise stops, clear announcements, unwavering attention. My heart pounded, not just from the pressure of the audit, but from the memory of the abbot\u2019s gentle request the night before. The monastery\u2019s annual festival began at dawn, and I had promised to help with the preparations, a commitment I cherished as a Buddhist\u2014serving the community, honoring tradition, finding peace in shared ritual. Now, the supervisor\u2019s presence meant I couldn\u2019t leave early or risk a single misstep. Duty to my job demanded perfection; duty to my faith called for presence and service. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting my full devotion, each unwilling to yield. My hands tightened on the controls, torn between the tracks I must follow and the path my heart longed to walk."}
