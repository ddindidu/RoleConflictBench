It was the end of my shift, and the drawer was full of high-value transactions\u2014every cent needed to be accounted for. My manager expected nothing less than perfect accuracy, especially tonight, when the store had been unusually busy. As I double-checked the receipts, my phone buzzed in my pocket. A message from Sister Agnes: \u201cThe family next door lost everything in the fire. We\u2019re gathering food and clothes now. Can you come?\u201d My heart twisted. As a nun, I was expected to be there, to serve, to comfort, to act without hesitation. But the cash drawer demanded my attention, and any mistake could mean hours of reconciliation or worse, suspicion.
