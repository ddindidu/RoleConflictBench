My script only skimmed the surface, and I could hear the frustration in their voice as I fumbled for answers. My supervisor expected me to handle every objection smoothly, to keep the call going, to close the sale. But my mind kept drifting to the family next door\u2014their home blackened by fire, their children in need of warm clothes and a hot meal. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and practical help, especially in moments like this. The convent was organizing a relief effort, and my sisters were already gathering supplies. I felt the weight of the headset, the pressure to perform, to meet my quota, but my heart ached to be at the family\u2019s side, living out the compassion I had vowed to embody. The customer\u2019s voice pulled me back, demanding answers I didn\u2019t have, while the image of the shivering children haunted me. I sat frozen, torn between the demands of my job and the call to serve, unsure which voice to answer first."}
