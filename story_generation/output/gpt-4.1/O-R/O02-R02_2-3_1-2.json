My phone buzzed with another message from the project manager: \u201cWe need the demo ready by tomorrow. Stakeholders are anxious.\u201d I could almost feel the weight of their expectations pressing down on me\u2014if I didn\u2019t deliver, the project might not get the green light. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. In just a few hours, the temple would fill with hundreds of worshippers for the most significant religious holiday of the year. As their priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, offer guidance, and be fully present for the community. They counted on me for spiritual comfort, especially on this day. I felt torn, my mind racing between lines of code and lines of scripture. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent, and both mattered deeply to people who trusted me. My hands trembled as I tried to focus, but the conflict inside me only grew sharper with every passing minute."}
