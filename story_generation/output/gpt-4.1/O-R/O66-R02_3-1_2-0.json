My passenger, a nervous businessman, kept glancing at his watch and muttering about missing his international flight. I could feel his anxiety pressing on me, urging me to drive faster, to somehow beat the storm and get him to the airport on time. But every time I considered speeding up, the car slid a little, reminding me of my duty to keep us both safe.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the daily prayer service at the church was about to begin. As the priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, to be a steady presence for my small congregation, even if today\u2019s service was routine and optional. I imagined the handful of faithful waiting in the quiet sanctuary, expecting my calm guidance. Torn between the urgent needs of my passenger and the quiet expectations of my parishioners, I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
