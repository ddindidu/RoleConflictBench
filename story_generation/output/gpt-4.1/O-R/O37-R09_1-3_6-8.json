I hesitated, glancing at the clock\u2014almost time for the afternoon funeral prayer at the synagogue. I knew they needed one more person for the minyan, and I was the only one nearby who could make it. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cAlways wear gloves, especially with these chemicals.\u201d But I\u2019d rushed today, only putting them on for the dirtiest jobs, and now my hands were raw and tingling. If I left now, I\u2019d have to go straight to the synagogue, hands unwashed, maybe still carrying traces of cleaner. I imagined the expectant faces of the mourners, waiting for the prayer to begin, and the stern look of my supervisor if she found out I\u2019d skipped protocol. My heart pounded as I stared at my hands, torn between my duty to my faith and my responsibility to keep everyone safe."}
