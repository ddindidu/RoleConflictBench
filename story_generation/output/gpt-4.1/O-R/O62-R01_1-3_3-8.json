As a lifeguard, I was expected to keep everything in order, so I scanned the deck. A few pool chairs were out of line, not broken, but not where they should be. I knew the supervisor wanted everything perfect, and I felt the familiar pressure to fix it before anyone else arrived. But my mind kept drifting to the church hall, where I was supposed to lead an intensive workshop in just an hour. As a pastor, I was expected to guide community leaders through challenging theological ideas, and I\u2019d spent weeks preparing. I could almost hear their voices, eager for clarity and inspiration. Yet here I was, torn between straightening chairs and reviewing my notes one last time. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding order and safety, the other calling for wisdom and spiritual leadership. I stood by the pool, heart pounding, caught between the expectations of two worlds, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
