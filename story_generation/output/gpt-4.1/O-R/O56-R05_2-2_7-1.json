She\u2019d come straight from the gym, her hair damp and greasy, and I could smell the faint tang of sweat. I knew she expected me to work my usual magic\u2014cleanse, condition, and style her hair so she\u2019d leave feeling renewed. But as I rinsed, my mind kept drifting to the sermon notes tucked in my bag in the back room. Shabbat was only a few hours away, and I hadn\u2019t finished preparing my message for the congregation. They expected inspiration, guidance, and a sense of peace from me every week. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the client in my chair needing my full attention, and my community waiting for words I hadn\u2019t yet found. My hands moved automatically, but my heart was torn, caught between the demands of scissors and scripture, between the salon\u2019s chatter and the sanctuary\u2019s hush."}
