As a carpenter, I knew the importance of keeping my workspace tidy\u2014one stray nail or misplaced saw could mean disaster. My crew looked to me to set the standard for safety, and I prided myself on never cutting corners. But today, my phone buzzed with reminders from the mosque committee: I was the sole imam scheduled for the Friday sermon, and the community was expecting my words on patience and perseverance. The topic had been announced, and people would be traveling from neighboring towns to hear me speak. The clock ticked closer to noon, and my heart pounded with anxiety. If I left now, the workshop would be a mess, risking an accident for anyone who stayed behind. But if I stayed to clean, I\u2019d miss the sermon, disappointing the congregation and failing my duty as their spiritual guide. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood frozen, torn between the safety of my team and the faith of my community."}
