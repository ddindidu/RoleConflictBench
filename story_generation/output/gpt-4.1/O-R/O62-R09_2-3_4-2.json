As I walked along the deck, my foot caught on something\u2014one of the lane ropes was frayed, nearly snapped. Swim lessons would start in an hour, and if I didn\u2019t fix it, the kids could get tangled or the class would be thrown into chaos. I knew it was my responsibility as a lifeguard to keep everything safe and ready. But as I reached for the repair kit, my phone buzzed. It was a reminder: my son\u2019s bar mitzvah was just days away, and he still struggled with his Torah portion. I\u2019d promised to help him practice this morning, to guide him through the words and melodies, to pass on the traditions that meant so much to our family. My heart twisted. The pool needed me, but so did my son. I could picture his anxious face, waiting for me at home, hoping for reassurance and guidance. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
