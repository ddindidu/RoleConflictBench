As a judge, I am expected to review every detail, even for a procedural hearing, to ensure fairness and uphold the law. The hearing is in two weeks, but I know that diligence now prevents mistakes later. Yet, as I glance at the clock, I realize it is nearly dusk\u2014the time I always set aside to light the lamp and offer prayers at my home altar. As a Hindu, this daily ritual is not just tradition; it is a moment of peace, a connection to my faith, and a promise to my family that I honor our beliefs.\n\nBut the file sits before me, urgent in its own way, and I feel the pressure of both worlds. If I delay my prayers, I betray a part of myself and the expectations of my family. If I set the file aside, I risk missing something important, failing in my duty to the court. My mind races, torn between the quiet sanctity of my altar and the silent demand of the law, each calling me with equal force."}
