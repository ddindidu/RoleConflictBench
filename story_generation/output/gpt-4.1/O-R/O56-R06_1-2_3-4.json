Mrs. Lee, a regular, smiled at her reflection but hesitated. \u201cCould you just trim a little more here?\u201d she asked, touching her bangs. I nodded, but my heart thudded. The church bells would ring in twenty minutes, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss another Sunday service. My pastor had gently reminded me last week how important it was to worship together, to be present for the community. But Mrs. Lee was always so kind, and I prided myself on making sure every client left happy. I could see she wanted to ask, \u201cIs it too much trouble?\u201d I wanted to reassure her, to show her she mattered. Yet, the thought of slipping into the pews late, or not at all, made my chest tighten. I held my scissors, caught between the gentle expectation in her eyes and the quiet pull of my faith, unsure which promise I was about to break."}
