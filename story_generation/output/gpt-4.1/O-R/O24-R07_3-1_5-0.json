The defendant\u2019s anxious eyes haunt me as I sit at my desk, pen poised above the order form. The law demands clarity and precision; every word I write could shape a life. I know the defendant cannot leave custody until I finish this order, and the clock ticks louder with each passing minute.\n\nBut tonight is also the temple\u2019s evening chant, a ritual I have never missed. My sangha expects my presence, my voice joining theirs in the slow, calming rhythm that brings us all peace. I promised myself, and them, that I would be there\u2014present, mindful, a true member of the community.\n\nMy hands tremble. The judge in me feels the weight of justice, the urgency of freedom for someone waiting behind bars. The Buddhist in me aches for the stillness, the unity, the spiritual nourishment of the chant. I stare at the blank page, torn between duty and devotion, feeling the strain of two worlds pulling me apart."}
