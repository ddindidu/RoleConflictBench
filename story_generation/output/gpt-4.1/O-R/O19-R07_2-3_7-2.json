Today was the day of the local workshop on updated prescription guidelines\u2014a crucial event for any pharmacist who wants to provide the best care. My supervisor had emphasized how important it was to stay current, and I knew my patients depended on my knowledge. But as I reached for my white coat, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the monastery\u2019s annual festival also began at dawn. As a practicing Buddhist, I was expected to help with the preparations, to chant, to serve, to be present for my community. The monks had asked for committed volunteers weeks ago, and I had promised to help. I could almost hear the gentle chime of the temple bell, smell the incense, feel the peace that came from being part of something larger than myself. Yet, the weight of my professional responsibility pressed on me. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each shaping who I am."}
