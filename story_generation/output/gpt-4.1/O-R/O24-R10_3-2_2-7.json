As a judge, I was expected to review the emergency motion for a temporary restraining order that had just landed on my desk. The law demanded my full attention, a careful reading of every document, and a swift, fair decision within the hour. But my phone buzzed with messages from my family, reminding me that the puja for my cousin\u2019s wedding was about to begin. As a Hindu, I was expected to be there, dressed in my finest, to offer prayers and blessings, to honor my family and our traditions. My suit hung on the back of my chair, but my kurta was waiting at home. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014justice on one side, devotion on the other. My mind raced, torn between the urgent call of the courtroom and the sacred pull of my faith. I stared at the case file, my heart pounding, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
