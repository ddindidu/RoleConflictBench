She twisted in the chair, frowning at her reflection. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite what I expected,\u201d she said, voice tight. As a hairdresser, I knew I should stay, listen, and fix her colour\u2014client satisfaction was everything. But I was already dressed for the mosque, my long sleeves and scarf in place, ready to leave for the main prayer hall. The imam\u2019s call to prayer echoed faintly from my phone, a reminder of my duty as a Muslim to join the congregation on time, dressed modestly and focused. My heart pounded as I weighed her disappointment against my own spiritual obligation. I could see her waiting for reassurance, but I also felt the pull of my faith, the expectation to be present and prepared for worship. The two worlds collided inside me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. I stood frozen, torn between the mirror and the mosque, unsure which expectation I would let down."}
