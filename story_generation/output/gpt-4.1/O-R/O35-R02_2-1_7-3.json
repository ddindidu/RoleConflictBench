The pre-shift briefing was about to begin, and today\u2019s agenda included new operational procedures\u2014mandatory, no exceptions. As a subway operator, I knew the importance of these briefings; missing even a detail could mean risking passenger safety or violating protocol. Just as I reached for the door, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Anna, a parishioner from my church. She wrote, \u201cHi, Father, I was wondering if we could talk sometime soon. Nothing urgent, just feeling a bit lost lately.\u201d \n\nI paused, thumb hovering over the screen. As a priest, I was expected to be available, to offer comfort and guidance, even if it was just to schedule a future conversation. But the briefing was starting now, and my supervisor had already warned us about tardiness. My mind raced\u2014should I quickly reply, risking being late, or ignore her for now, betraying the trust my parishioners placed in me? The weight of both uniforms pressed on my shoulders as I stood frozen, torn between duty and compassion."}
