His hands trembled slightly, and his eyes darted nervously whenever someone passed by. As a nursing assistant, I knew I should sit with him, offer comfort, and help ease his anxiety. But just as I was about to approach him, my phone buzzed with a message from my church group: a close friend was going through a crisis and needed someone to talk to right away. My heart ached, torn between my duty to provide emotional support to Mr. Thompson and my calling as a Christian to show love and kindness to my struggling friend. Both needed me, both expected compassion and presence, but I only had so much time and energy. I stood in the hallway, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which path to take."}
