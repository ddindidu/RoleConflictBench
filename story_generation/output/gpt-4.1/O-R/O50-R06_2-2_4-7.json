The maintenance logs flashed red on my tablet\u2014three machines overdue for cleaning, their temperatures creeping up dangerously. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford another breakdown. Stay late if you have to.\u201d I knew what was expected of me as a machine repairer\u2014keep everything running, no matter what.\n\nBut as I wiped the grease from my hands, my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah. She was struggling again, her father in the hospital, her voice trembling through the text. As a Christian, I felt the pull to reach out, to offer comfort and prayer, to be present for her in her pain. The teachings of Jesus pressed on my heart: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d\n\nI stared at the machines, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds. The demands of my job and the call to show kindness clashed inside me, each urgent in its own way. My hands trembled, caught between the whirring engines and the silent plea for compassion."}
