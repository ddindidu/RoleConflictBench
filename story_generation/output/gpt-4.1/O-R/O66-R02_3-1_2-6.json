He\u2019d told me his flight was international, non-refundable, and the last one out before the storm shut everything down. Every minute counted, but the roads were slick, and I could feel the taxi fishtailing if I pushed the speed. My phone buzzed on the dashboard\u2014a reminder for the planning meeting at the parish. Tonight, I was supposed to lead the first session for the new adult faith formation series, something I\u2019d promised the congregation and the children\u2019s parents I\u2019d organize with care and presence. I could picture the committee gathering in the church hall, waiting for me to open with prayer and vision. My passenger\u2019s voice broke through my thoughts, pleading for me to go faster. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the responsibility to get him safely to the airport, and the commitment to my parish, who counted on me for guidance and leadership. My heart pounded as I stared at the icy road ahead, torn between two urgent calls, knowing I could not answer both."}
