The courthouse was quiet, the kind of hush that settles after a long day. My client\u2019s procedural hearing was scheduled for tomorrow evening\u2014a minor matter, nothing urgent, and I knew from experience that a postponement would be granted without fuss. Still, as their lawyer, I was expected to be present, to represent them with diligence, no matter how trivial the case seemed.\n\nYet tonight, for the first time in weeks, my calendar was clear. I had promised myself this evening would be different: a chance to sit quietly, recite the Quran, and reflect, as my faith encourages. The thought of that peaceful time filled me with longing. But the expectation to be ever-available for my clients tugged at me, a silent pressure I couldn\u2019t ignore.\n\nI felt the tension coil in my chest. Was I letting my client down if I asked for a postponement? Was I neglecting my spiritual needs if I didn\u2019t? The courthouse and the Quran, duty and devotion\u2014both called to me, and I sat at my desk, torn, unable to move."}
