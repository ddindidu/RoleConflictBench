The rapid strep test was positive. She looked at me with tired eyes, asking for antibiotics. As a doctor, I knew the guidelines: prescribe the right medication, ensure her quick recovery, and prevent complications. But she hesitated, mentioning her financial struggles and her belief in natural healing, asking if I could just write a note for her work and let her try home remedies first. \n\nAs a Christian, I felt the weight of compassion and honesty. I wanted to respect her wishes, to show kindness and understanding, but I also knew my duty to provide the best medical care. If I withheld antibiotics, was I putting her at risk? If I pushed her to accept treatment she didn\u2019t want, was I ignoring her autonomy and faith? My mind spun with the tension between my professional responsibility and my desire to act with Christian love and respect. I could feel the pressure building inside me, torn between what I was trained to do and what I felt in my heart was right."}
