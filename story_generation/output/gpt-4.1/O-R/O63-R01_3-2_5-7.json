It was the last day of the quarter, and the sales manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sign-ups, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d My screen blinked with the next lead, but my heart thudded with guilt. As a pastor, I was preparing a sermon about honesty and compassion, urging my congregation to act with integrity, even when it\u2019s hard. Yet here I was, rehearsing the script that skirted the truth just enough to close the deal. The pressure from my team was palpable\u2014everyone\u2019s eyes on the sales board, everyone\u2019s hopes riding on these last calls.
