My manager expects me to keep the line moving, double-check prices, and make sure the till balances at the end of my shift. I glance at the clock\u2014services at the synagogue start in twenty minutes. I promised my family I\u2019d be there, and even though attendance is usually fine without me, I know how much it means to my parents, and to myself, to keep that commitment. The next customer unloads a full cart, and I can feel the minutes slipping away. My heart pounds as I weigh the responsibility to my job against my obligation to my faith. If I leave now, I\u2019ll let down my manager and inconvenience the customers. If I stay, I\u2019ll miss the service and disappoint my family. I grip the scanner a little tighter, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I should honor."}
