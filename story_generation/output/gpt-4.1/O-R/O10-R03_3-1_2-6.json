As an accountant for the convent, I prided myself on keeping our finances in perfect order. Today, I had planned a rare afternoon of solitude\u2014time set aside for spiritual reading and quiet reflection, something my heart had been yearning for all week. Just as I opened my worn prayer book, Sister Agnes hurried in, her face anxious. \u201cThe external auditor is here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe needs the quarterly statements right away.\u201d My mind raced. The expectation to provide accurate, up-to-date records was clear; any delay could raise suspicion or cause trouble for our small community. Yet, the bell for afternoon silence was about to ring, signaling the sacred hours I had promised to devote to God. My hands trembled as I closed the prayer book, feeling the weight of both callings pressing in on me. The numbers on the ledger blurred with the words of scripture in my mind, and I sat frozen, torn between duty to my profession and devotion to my faith, unsure which voice to answer first."}
