She held out the toy, its wheel dangling by a thread. \u201cCan you fix this before Shabbat?\u201d she asked, her voice hopeful. I glanced at the clock\u2014just an hour before the evening service at synagogue. As a carpenter, I knew the expectation: offer a fair quote, reassure the customer, and get to work. But as a Jew, I was expected at the synagogue, to join the prayers and be part of the community, even if my absence wouldn\u2019t be noticed in the crowd. My hands itched to start the repair, to bring joy to a child, but my heart tugged me toward the sanctuary, the familiar melodies, the sense of belonging. I stood there, caught between the sawdust and the sacred, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to follow."}
