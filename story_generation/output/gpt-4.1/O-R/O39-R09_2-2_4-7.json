My supervisor always says safety comes first\u2014any spill, no matter how small, has to be cleaned up right away. I reached for the mop, but my phone buzzed. It was a reminder: I was scheduled to chant Torah at synagogue in less than an hour. Missing my turn wasn\u2019t an option; the community counted on me, and I\u2019d promised my father I\u2019d never let them down. But if I left now, someone could slip and get hurt, and I\u2019d be letting my crew down too. My hands shook as I weighed the mop in one and my prayer book in the other, heart pounding with the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
