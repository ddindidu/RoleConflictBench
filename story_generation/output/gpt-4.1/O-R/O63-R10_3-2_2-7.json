My shift as a telemarketer was supposed to end in ten minutes, just enough time to rush home, change into my kurta, and join my family for the puja. Today was special\u2014my mother had reminded me all week about the importance of being present for the ceremony. But now, a call flashed on my screen: a long-time customer, voice sharp with suspicion, demanded to know why our offer sounded too good to be true. He wanted details, explanations, reassurances. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNever rush a customer, always handle objections with patience.\u201d I could hear the faint sound of temple bells in my memory, the scent of incense, my family waiting. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the customer\u2019s questions, but my mind kept drifting to the festival, the rituals, the expectations of my family and my faith. I felt torn, caught between the duty to my job and the pull of my heritage, unsure which voice to listen to as the minutes slipped away."}
