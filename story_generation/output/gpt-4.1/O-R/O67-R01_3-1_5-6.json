As an ambulance driver, I was trained to act fast, to keep calm, to do everything possible to keep him alive until we reached the hospital. My partner barked out vital signs, and I could see the fear in the patient\u2019s eyes. I wanted to reassure him, to offer more than just oxygen and compressions.\n\nBut earlier that day, at the community center, I\u2019d been Pastor Mark, sharing the story of the Good Samaritan. I\u2019d told everyone that faith means trusting in God\u2019s plan, even in suffering. Now, as the man gasped for air, I felt the urge to pray aloud, to offer spiritual comfort. Yet, as a medical professional, I knew my priority was to provide care, not sermons. My mind raced\u2014should I speak words of faith, or focus only on the medical protocol? The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I felt torn, caught between the expectations of my calling and my duty."}
