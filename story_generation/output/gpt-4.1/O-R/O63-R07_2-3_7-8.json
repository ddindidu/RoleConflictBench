Management has sent two reminders today: \u201cBreaks must be logged exactly. No exceptions.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014my scheduled break is in five minutes, but the calls keep coming, and I know they\u2019re watching. My mind drifts to the temple, to the quiet space where I\u2019m supposed to be summarizing the Heart Sutra for tomorrow\u2019s session. My teacher\u2019s words echo: \u201cReflection is as important as recitation. Take time to understand.\u201d I promised I would prepare, but the only time I have is during my break. If I use it for study, I risk being late back, and management will notice. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll let my teacher down and feel the emptiness of unkept vows. The pressure builds in my chest\u2014work\u2019s demands on one side, my spiritual commitment on the other. The break bell chimes, and I stare at my desk, torn between the ringing phones and the silent call of the Dharma."}
