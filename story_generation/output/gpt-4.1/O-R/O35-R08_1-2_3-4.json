My uniform feels crisp, but I\u2019m already thinking about the office function this afternoon. The invitation said \u201cbusiness casual,\u201d but I know from past events that my colleagues\u2014men and women\u2014tend to dress more relaxed, sometimes even informal. As a Muslim, I always try to dress modestly: long sleeves, loose clothing, and a scarf. I worry about standing out, about the curious glances and the questions that sometimes follow.\n\nThe intercom crackles. A passenger\u2019s voice comes through, asking for directions to a transfer line. I answer calmly, giving clear instructions, reminding myself that my job is to help, to keep everyone safe and informed. But my mind drifts back to the function. My supervisor expects us all to mingle, to show team spirit. I know I\u2019ll be expected to fit in, to look approachable, maybe even to join in a group photo.\n\nI feel the tension rising inside me\u2014between the uniform I wear for work, the modest clothes I choose for faith, and the unspoken pressure to blend in with my colleagues. The train speeds on, and I\u2019m left wrestling with what to wear, and who I need to be."}
