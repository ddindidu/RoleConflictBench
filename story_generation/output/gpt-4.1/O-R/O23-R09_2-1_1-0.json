The filing deadline was tomorrow, and my client was counting on me to catch every detail, every loophole. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for our weekly study session with my children. We\u2019d planned to discuss the story of Ruth tonight, a lesson in kindness and loyalty, values I wanted to pass on. I glanced at the clock. If I shifted the lesson, we wouldn\u2019t lose continuity, but I\u2019d be breaking a promise to my kids, and to myself, about the importance of our traditions. Yet, if I didn\u2019t finish this review, my client\u2019s deal could fall apart. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the meticulous lawyer, the devoted Jewish parent. My mind raced, torn between professional duty and the quiet, sacred responsibility of teaching my children. I stared at the contract, then at the children\u2019s books on the table, feeling the tension knot in my chest, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
