As an accountant, I knew how crucial it was to stay updated\u2014missing this seminar could mean falling behind on new regulations, risking mistakes for my clients. The seminar was scheduled for the same afternoon as the special remembrance at the mosque. As the imam, I was expected to lead the prayers, especially today, when the gathering was larger than usual and no one else was authorized to step in. The community looked to me for guidance and spiritual leadership, and I could already imagine the disappointment if I wasn\u2019t there. My phone buzzed with reminders from both worlds: a client\u2019s anxious message about tax changes, and a committee member\u2019s call about the importance of my presence at the mosque. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each role demanding my full attention at the same time. I felt torn, my mind racing with the consequences of letting down either side, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be leaving something important behind."}
