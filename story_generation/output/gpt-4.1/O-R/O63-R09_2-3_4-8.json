I was still three sales short of my weekly target, and my manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers, or we\u2019ll have to talk.\u201d My headset felt heavier than usual as I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch in my head. Suddenly, my phone buzzed with a message from the synagogue: \u201cWe need one more for minyan at the funeral. Can you come?\u201d I stared at the screen, my stomach twisting. I knew how important it was to be there, to help the mourners say Kaddish. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss my chance to make those last sales, and I couldn\u2019t afford another bad week. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me\u2014my job demanding numbers, my faith demanding presence. I sat frozen, headset in one hand, phone in the other, torn between the expectations that defined who I was."}
