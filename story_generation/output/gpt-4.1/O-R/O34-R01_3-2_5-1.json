Every second mattered. At the same time, my phone buzzed on the desk\u2014a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. \u201cPastor, I need to talk. It\u2019s urgent. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d I knew her struggle; she\u2019d been wrestling with a life-altering decision, and she was reaching out for guidance, for hope. My mind split in two\u2014one part focused on the aircraft in peril, the other aching for Sarah\u2019s pain. The weight of both roles pressed down on me: the expectation to keep lives safe in the sky, and the call to shepherd a soul in distress.
