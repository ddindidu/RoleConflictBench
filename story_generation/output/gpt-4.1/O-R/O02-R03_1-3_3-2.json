As an engineer, I knew the audit was coming in three weeks\u2014plenty of time, if I kept my focus, to ensure every document was flawless and every safety protocol up to code. My supervisor expected nothing less; any oversight could mean fines or worse, a risk to lives.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again, a message from the convent. The mayor was pleading for help. Hundreds were homeless, the community center overflowing, and the sisters were stretched thin. As a nun, I was called to serve, to comfort, to organize food and shelter for those who had lost everything. The expectation was clear: I should be there, sleeves rolled up, leading the relief effort.\n\nMy heart ached as I stared at the clock, torn between duty and compassion. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full presence, each too important to neglect. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, knowing that whatever I decided, something vital would be left undone."}
