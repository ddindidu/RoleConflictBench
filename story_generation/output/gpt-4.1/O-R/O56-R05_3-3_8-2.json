The buildup was worse than I\u2019d ever seen, and I knew if I didn\u2019t take my time, my scissors would snag and ruin her cut. She was anxious, glancing at her watch, but I couldn\u2019t rush this. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the High Holiday sermon. The congregation would be gathering soon, expecting words of comfort and inspiration from their rabbi. I hadn\u2019t finished my notes, and the weight of their expectations pressed on me. My mind raced between the stubborn knots before me and the sacred message I needed to deliver. I felt torn\u2014my clients trusted me to care for their hair, but my community needed me to guide them through one of the holiest days of the year. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the task at hand, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and both roles demanded all of me."}
