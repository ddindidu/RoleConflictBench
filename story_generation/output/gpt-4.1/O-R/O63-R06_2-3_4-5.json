I had just one hour left in my shift, and I was still three sales short of my weekly target. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers, or we\u2019ll have to talk about your future here.\u201d I stared at the list of cold leads, knowing I\u2019d have to push hard, maybe even bend the truth a little, to close those last deals. But then my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the Wednesday evening church service. I\u2019d promised my pastor and my small group that I\u2019d be there, not just to worship, but to help set up for the community dinner. My faith teaches me to be honest, to serve others, and to keep my commitments. But the pressure to keep my job, to not let my team down, was crushing. I felt torn in two, my hands trembling as I weighed the demands of my work against the call of my faith, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
