As the head lifeguard, I always checked the lanes before the swim lessons began. Today, I found a broken lane rope, its frayed ends floating uselessly. If I didn\u2019t fix it, the lessons would be chaotic, and the parents would complain. My supervisor expected me to keep everything in perfect order. I glanced at my watch\u2014Friday prayers were only an hour away. As the imam, I was supposed to deliver the Khutbah, a responsibility I never took lightly. The congregation looked to me for guidance, especially on Fridays. But today, we had a guest speaker who could step in if I wasn\u2019t there. Still, I knew some members would be disappointed if I didn\u2019t give the sermon myself. I stood at the edge of the pool, torn between the urgent need to repair the lane rope and the spiritual duty waiting for me at the mosque. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension rise with every passing minute."}
