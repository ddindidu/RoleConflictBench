My client\u2019s future hinges on my performance; the stakes are high, and the judge has made it clear\u2014no delays, no excuses. Yet, as I glance at my phone, a message from the monastery appears: \u201cWe need you at dawn for the festival. The community is counting on your presence and help.\u201d This festival is sacred, a time when I reconnect with my sangha and deepen my practice. I promised to help with the preparations, to be present in body and spirit. Now, I feel the expectations of both worlds pressing in. My client\u2019s trust, the court\u2019s demands, the silent call of the Buddha, and the gentle urging of my fellow practitioners\u2014all pulling me in opposite directions. My mind races, torn between duty and devotion, justice and compassion, as the night deepens and the decision looms."}
