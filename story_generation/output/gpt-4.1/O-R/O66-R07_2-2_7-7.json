Two travelers waved me down, their arms full of suitcases, faces flushed with exhaustion. \u201cCan you help us load these? We\u2019re splitting the fare to the airport,\u201d one said, hopeful. I nodded, feeling the familiar tug of duty\u2014professional service meant more than just driving; it meant patience, strength, and a welcoming smile, no matter how tired I was. But tonight was the weekly study circle at the temple, and I hadn\u2019t yet read the chapter on compassion and detachment. My teacher always said true understanding came from reflection, not just attendance. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss another session, not after last week\u2019s absence. Yet here I was, hands on the trunk, heart pulled in two directions: serve my passengers well, or honor my commitment to spiritual growth. The weight of their luggage seemed lighter than the burden of this choice."}
