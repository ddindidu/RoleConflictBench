I reached for the phone, coordinating with controllers in the adjacent towers, my mind racing to keep the airspace safe and clear. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder: the daily prayer service was about to begin. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead, to offer calm and guidance, even if today\u2019s service was routine and optional. I could almost hear the congregation gathering, waiting for me to bring them together in peace. My heart pounded, torn between the chaos of the control room and the quiet sanctuary of the chapel. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each expecting my full presence, each vital in its own way. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which call I would answer."}
