My hands moved quickly, counting bills, double-checking receipts, aware that any mistake could mean a costly error. The store was quiet, but my mind was not. I glanced at the clock\u2014fifteen minutes until morning prayers. The convent\u2019s bell would soon ring, calling all sisters to the chapel. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to join in the sacred rhythm of our day, to show devotion and unity. But as a cashier, I couldn\u2019t leave the register unfinished; the manager trusted me to close out the drawer with precision. My heart pounded with the weight of both duties. I imagined the disappointment in Mother Superior\u2019s eyes if I arrived late, the silent question in my manager\u2019s voice if the numbers didn\u2019t add up. I stood at the crossroads of my two worlds, torn between the ringing of the chapel bell and the clink of coins in my hand, feeling the pressure of expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
