My phone buzzed with a new delivery assignment: a high-value package that had to be hand-delivered and signed for by the recipient. The address was across town, and the instructions were clear\u2014no leaving it at the door, no exceptions. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was to secure every delivery, especially the sensitive ones. Missing a delivery or failing to verify the recipient could mean disciplinary action.\n\nBut my heart ached as I thought about my church community. I\u2019d promised to help set up for the service, and I knew people counted on me to be there, not just to worship but to serve. I could already imagine the disappointment on my pastor\u2019s face if I didn\u2019t show up again. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I sat at the intersection, caught between the demands of my job and my faith, unsure which road to take."}
