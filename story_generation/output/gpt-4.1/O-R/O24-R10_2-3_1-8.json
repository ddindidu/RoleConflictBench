As a judge, I knew the weight of my responsibility\u2014to review every argument, every piece of evidence, so that justice would not falter on my account. Yet, my phone buzzed with messages from my family, already on their way to the temple for the festival. Today was the most sacred day in our calendar, and as a Hindu, I was expected to be there, to offer prayers and participate in rituals that only happened once a year. My heart ached with longing; I could almost hear the temple bells and smell the incense. But the files in front of me were relentless, whispering of lives and livelihoods that depended on my careful judgment. I felt torn, the expectations of my faith and my profession pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my presence, each refusing to yield."}
