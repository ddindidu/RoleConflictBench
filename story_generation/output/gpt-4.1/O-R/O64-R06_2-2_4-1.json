A woman approached, her eyes anxious, clutching a blender. \u201cI need to return this,\u201d she said, voice trembling. I asked for her receipt, but she shook her head. \u201cI lost it. Please, I really need the money back. My son is sick.\u201d My training echoed in my mind: no returns without a receipt, no exceptions. That was the rule, clear and simple. But as she pleaded, I felt the weight of my faith pressing on my heart. Jesus taught compassion, mercy, and helping those in need. Wasn\u2019t this a moment to show grace? Yet, I knew my manager expected me to uphold the policy, to be fair to all customers and protect the store from loss. My hands hovered over the register, torn between the rules I was paid to follow and the kindness I was called to live. My chest tightened as I wrestled with what to do next."}
