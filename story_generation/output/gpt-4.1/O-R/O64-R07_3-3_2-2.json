It\u2019s the end of my shift, and the transactions are larger than usual\u2014people cashing out, making deposits, and every number must be perfect. My manager expects nothing less; a single mistake could mean hours of reconciliation, or worse, suspicion. I feel the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders, my mind racing to keep up with the calculations.\n\nBut as I glance at the clock, my heart tightens. The monastery\u2019s annual festival begins at dawn, and I promised to help with the preparations. The community relies on me, not just for my hands but for my presence, my devotion. The rituals are sacred, and missing them would be a deep disappointment\u2014not only to the monks but to myself. I feel torn, the demands of accuracy and duty at the register clashing with the call to spiritual service. My mind is a storm of numbers and prayers, and I can\u2019t silence the ache of letting someone down, no matter which path I choose."}
