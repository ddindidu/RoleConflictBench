She glared at her reflection, her voice rising with every complaint about the cut. I forced a smile, apologizing and offering to fix it, even as my mind raced with worry. Tonight was supposed to be the last big practice for my son\u2019s bar mitzvah, and he still stumbled over the Torah portion. I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d be home early to help, to guide him through the words and the meaning behind them, just as my parents had done for me. But now, with the client\u2019s anger filling the room and my coworkers glancing at the clock, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down. My duty as a hairdresser demanded patience and professionalism, but my heart ached with the responsibility to teach my son, to pass on our traditions. I stood there, scissors in hand, torn between the expectations of my work and the needs of my family, unsure which role to answer first."}
