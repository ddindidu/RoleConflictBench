The call volume was unusually light today, and my supervisor had just sent a message: \u201cFeel free to take your break whenever you need.\u201d I felt a rare sense of freedom, but it was short-lived. My phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014today was the main weekly service at the church, the one I led as a priest, the one my community counted on. I was expected to be there, to guide prayers and offer comfort, especially to those who only came this one day. But my telemarketing job, with its strict adherence to hours and breaks, was my livelihood. If I left now, I\u2019d be bending the rules, even if my supervisor was lenient today. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: the quiet duty to my callers, the sacred responsibility to my congregation. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between two worlds, each demanding a different part of me."}
