Tomorrow, the jury trial I\u2019d prepared for months would begin\u2014a high-stakes case, my client\u2019s future hanging in the balance. The judge had made it clear: no delays, no excuses. As a lawyer, I owed my client my full attention, my sharpest arguments, my unwavering presence in that courtroom.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the workshop for our community leaders started tomorrow too. As their pastor, I\u2019d promised to guide them through challenging theological questions, to help them grow in faith and wisdom. They trusted me to be there, to teach, to listen, to lead.\n\nI felt pulled apart. My client needed my advocacy; my congregation needed my guidance. Both roles demanded my whole self, at the same time. I could already imagine the disappointment in my client\u2019s eyes if I faltered, the confusion in my church members\u2019 faces if I was absent. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible expectations, the weight of two worlds pressing in, and wondered how I could possibly choose."}
