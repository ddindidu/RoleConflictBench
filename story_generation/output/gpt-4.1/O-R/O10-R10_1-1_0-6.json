The deadline loomed, and as an accountant, accuracy was everything\u2014one mistake could mean trouble for the whole firm. My phone buzzed with reminders, and my manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need those files by end of day, no exceptions.\u201d\n\nBut through the window, I caught sight of bright marigold garlands and heard the distant beat of drums. The local temple was alive with celebration\u2014today was a festival I\u2019d grown up cherishing. As a Hindu, I was expected to join the rituals, offer prayers, and be with my community. My family had already messaged, asking when I\u2019d arrive. The scent of incense drifted in, tugging at my heart.\n\nI glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the duty to my profession and the pull of my faith.
