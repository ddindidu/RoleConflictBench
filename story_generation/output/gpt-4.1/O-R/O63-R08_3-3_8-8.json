As a telemarketer, every minute is tracked, every unscheduled pause flagged by the compliance system. I\u2019ve seen colleagues get warnings for stepping away even a minute too long. The pressure to stick to my work hours is relentless, and I know my job depends on it. But today, my mind is far from the ringing phones and sales scripts. My doctor\u2019s words echo in my head: if I want to perform Hajj, it must be this year. My health is failing, and this might be my last chance to fulfill this pillar of my faith. The thought of asking for time off terrifies me. I imagine the system flagging my absence, the manager\u2019s disapproving look, the risk of losing my job. Yet, the pull of my faith is strong\u2014Hajj is not just a journey, it\u2019s a duty, a dream I\u2019ve carried for years. I sit at my desk, headset in hand, heart pounding, torn between the demands of my livelihood and the call of my faith, unsure which path I can afford to choose."}
