My phone buzzed with a reminder: synagogue services would start in twenty minutes. I\u2019d promised my family I\u2019d be there, and I knew how important it was to keep that commitment, even if the congregation could manage without me for one evening. As I debated whether to leave a few minutes early, I noticed a small boy edging into the deep end, a place strictly off-limits for his age. He slipped, flailing, his head bobbing under the surface. My training screamed at me to act, to enforce the rules and keep everyone safe. But if I stayed, I\u2019d miss the service\u2014again. If I left, I\u2019d be abandoning my post, betraying the trust placed in me as a lifeguard. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations of my faith against the duty to protect those in my care, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in, demanding an answer."}
