My next client, a regular, arrived straight from the gym, her hair damp and greasy. She smiled apologetically, mentioning she was in a rush and needed a quick trim before an important meeting. As a hairdresser, I knew I should wash and condition her hair first\u2014it's part of my job to ensure every client leaves feeling fresh and confident. But as I looked at my watch again, my heart pounded. I was scheduled to deliver the Friday sermon in less than an hour, and today was no ordinary Friday. Our community was celebrating a milestone, and people had travelled from neighboring towns just to hear me speak. The expectations weighed heavily: my client trusted me to care for her appearance, while my congregation expected inspiration and guidance. I felt torn, my hands trembling slightly as I reached for the shampoo bottle, my mind already drifting to the mosque and the words I had yet to prepare."}
