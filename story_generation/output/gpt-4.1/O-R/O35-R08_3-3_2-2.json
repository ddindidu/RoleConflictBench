The train hummed beneath me, packed with evening commuters. Suddenly, a red alert flashed: brake system malfunction. My training kicked in\u2014protocol demanded I report and stop the train immediately, no hesitation. My heart pounded. I knew every second counted for the safety of everyone on board.\n\nBut tonight was also the community Quran study circle, and I hadn\u2019t finished reading the assigned verses. I\u2019d promised myself and my friends I\u2019d be prepared, to honor my faith and contribute meaningfully. The expectation weighed on me; I didn\u2019t want to let them down or show up unprepared, especially when reflection and recitation are so important to me.\n\nAs the train sped through the tunnel, the alert blinked insistently. My mind raced between my duty to the passengers and my commitment to my faith. I felt torn, the pressure of both roles squeezing my chest. I gripped the controls, caught between the urgent demands of my job and the spiritual responsibility I held dear."}
