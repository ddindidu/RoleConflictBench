As an architect, I was trained to catch every detail, to ensure safety and compliance. Today, I noticed a few minor inconsistencies in the building plan\u2014nothing that would cause immediate harm, but still, not quite right. My mind raced with the implications: should I flag them and risk delaying the project, or let them slide, trusting they wouldn\u2019t matter?\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was Sarah from my congregation, her voice trembling. She needed to talk\u2014she was facing a life-altering decision and wanted my guidance as her pastor. I could hear the weight in her words, the hope that I would offer clarity and comfort.\n\nI felt torn. My duty as an architect demanded my full attention to the plans, to uphold safety and integrity. Yet, as a pastor, I was expected to be present, compassionate, and wise for those in need. The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My heart pounded as I stared at the plans, Sarah\u2019s voice echoing in my mind, caught between two worlds that needed me now."}
