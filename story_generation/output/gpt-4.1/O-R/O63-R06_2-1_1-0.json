My job as a telemarketer was clear: follow the script, handle objections, and keep the call moving. But today, the calls were different. Prospects kept asking detailed technical questions\u2014questions the script only half-answered. I could sense their confusion, their need for honest, thorough information. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cStick to the script. Don\u2019t get sidetracked.\u201d\n\nBut as a Christian, I felt a tug in my heart. I believed in honesty, in treating others as I\u2019d want to be treated. Was it right to dodge their questions, to gloss over details just to make a sale? Each time I redirected a caller back to the script, guilt gnawed at me. I wanted to help them understand, to be truthful, but the pressure to perform, to meet my quota, pressed down on me. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my next call waiting, as I wrestled with what I should do."}
