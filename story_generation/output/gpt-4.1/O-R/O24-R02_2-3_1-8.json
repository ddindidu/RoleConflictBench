As a judge, I knew the importance of being prepared\u2014every argument, every precedent, every nuance could tip the scales of justice. The civil case was complex, and the parties deserved nothing less than my most careful review. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from the parish office: the Martinez family needed me tonight. Their child\u2019s sacrament was days away, and the last preparation session\u2014one I was expected to lead as their priest\u2014could not be postponed.
