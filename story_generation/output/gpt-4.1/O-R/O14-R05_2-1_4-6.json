The departmental meeting was in two days, and I was expected to present our preliminary data. The numbers weren\u2019t as clear as I\u2019d hoped, and I knew my colleagues would expect a thorough, honest report\u2014no embellishments, no omissions. As I organized my notes, my phone buzzed. It was an email from a young couple, asking if I could officiate their wedding next summer. They wanted to meet soon, to talk about their hopes and dreams, and to see if I could be their rabbi on that special day.\n\nI felt the familiar tug between my two worlds. As a scientist, I owed my team my full attention, especially now, when the data was so delicate. As a rabbi, I was expected to be present, compassionate, and available, even for events far in the future. I could sense the weight of both expectations pressing in, each demanding my time, my focus, my heart. I stared at the email, then at my half-finished report, feeling the tension coil inside me, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
