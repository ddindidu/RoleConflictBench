The phone queue was relentless, management\u2019s eyes everywhere, and my break was scheduled for exactly 2:30. I glanced at the clock\u20142:28. My supervisor\u2019s reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cNo early breaks, no late returns. We\u2019re watching the logs.\u201d But today, 2:30 wasn\u2019t just a break. It was the start of my weekly adult Torah class, a drop-in session I\u2019d promised to lead, even if only one person showed up. I pictured the expectant faces, the quiet room waiting for words of wisdom, the trust placed in me as their rabbi. My heart tugged toward the sacred texts, the questions, the gentle guidance. But the call queue was full, and my absence would be noticed. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding precision and presence, the other asking for heart and spirit. My hand hovered over the \u201clog out\u201d button, torn between duty and calling, as the seconds ticked by."}
