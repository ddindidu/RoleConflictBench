My patient, Mrs. Goldstein, waited for me to help her bathe and dress before breakfast. She smiled when I entered, and I felt the familiar warmth of being needed. As I helped her sit up, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that Shabbat was only hours away. I still hadn\u2019t finished my sermon. The congregation expected words of comfort and wisdom, especially this week, after Mr. Levin\u2019s passing. My mind raced with unfinished thoughts and half-formed prayers, but Mrs. Goldstein needed me now, her frail hands trembling as I buttoned her blouse. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders: the immediate, physical needs of my patients and the spiritual, emotional needs of my community. I tried to focus on the task at hand, but my heart tugged in two directions, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
