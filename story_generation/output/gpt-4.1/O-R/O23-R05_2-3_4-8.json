Tomorrow at 10 a.m., I was due in court to argue a crucial motion for my client\u2014a motion that could determine the outcome of their entire case. They were counting on me, trusting my preparation and presence to defend their interests. As I reviewed my notes, my phone buzzed. It was the synagogue president. A beloved congregant had passed away unexpectedly, and the grieving family needed me to officiate the funeral. The only time the cemetery could accommodate was\u2014of course\u2014tomorrow at 10 a.m. I heard the pain in the widow\u2019s voice, her expectation that I would guide them through this sacred moment.

I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, my two worlds colliding, and I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
