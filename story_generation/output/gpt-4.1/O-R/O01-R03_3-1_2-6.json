As the lead architect for the new high-rise hospital, I knew the city\u2019s safety inspector would arrive tomorrow. Every detail had to be perfect\u2014lives depended on it. My phone buzzed with urgent messages from the engineering team, and my mind raced with calculations and code requirements. Yet, the chapel bell chimed softly, reminding me of the quiet afternoon I had promised myself for spiritual reading and reflection. As a nun, I was expected to nurture my soul, to find peace in prayer and contemplation. But the weight of responsibility pressed on me; the hospital\u2019s safety could not wait. My heart ached with the pull of both worlds\u2014one demanding my vigilance for the sake of others\u2019 bodies, the other calling me to tend to my own spirit. I closed my eyes, torn between the blueprints and the Bible, feeling the strain of two callings that, in this moment, seemed impossibly at odds."}
