As a judge, I was expected to write a clear, thorough judgment\u2014thirty days to distill weeks of testimony and evidence into a document that would shape lives. The legal community, the parties, and my own sense of duty demanded precision and timeliness. Yet, as I glanced at the calendar, my heart tightened. The most significant religious holiday was approaching, and as the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead prayers and rituals, to be present for every soul seeking comfort and guidance. The congregation looked to me for spiritual leadership, especially now. My mind raced between the legal arguments I needed to analyze and the sermons I needed to prepare. Each role called for my full presence, but time and energy were finite. I felt torn, guilty for even considering letting one side down. The expectations pressed in from both directions, and I wondered how I could possibly meet them all."}
