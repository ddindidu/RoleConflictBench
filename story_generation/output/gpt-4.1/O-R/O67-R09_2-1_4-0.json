I glanced at the clock\u2014fifteen minutes until the children would arrive, eager to learn about the story of Moses. Dispatch\u2019s voice was urgent: a woman had fallen, possibly a broken arm, pain management needed. My hands trembled as I grabbed my keys. I knew the children looked forward to these lessons, and their parents trusted me to pass on our traditions, to keep our history alive. But as an ambulance driver, I was trained to respond without hesitation, to be the first line of care when someone was hurt. I could call the parents, reschedule the lesson, but I also knew how much consistency mattered in teaching. My mind raced with the weight of both responsibilities\u2014one to my community, the other to a stranger in pain. I stood in the doorway, torn, the siren\u2019s echo in my ears and the children\u2019s voices in my heart, not yet knowing which path I would take."}
