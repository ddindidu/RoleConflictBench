Inside, a family waited for answers, their faces etched with hope and fear. As a doctor, I knew I had to speak with clarity and compassion, to guide them through the storm of a devastating diagnosis. My heart ached for them, and I rehearsed the words in my mind, searching for the gentlest way to break the news.\n\nBut my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. The mosque was full\u2014today was a special remembrance, and the congregation had gathered in numbers I hadn\u2019t seen in months. As the imam, I was expected to lead the prayers, to offer comfort and spiritual guidance. No one else could step in; the community was waiting for me.\n\nI felt torn in two, pulled by the desperate needs of both my patients and my congregation. My mind raced with the expectations placed upon me: to heal, to comfort, to lead, to inspire. I could feel the minutes slipping away, each one tightening the knot in my chest as I stood frozen between two worlds, unable to move forward."}
