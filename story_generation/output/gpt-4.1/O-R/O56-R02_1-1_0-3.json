The receptionist was idly scrolling through her phone, but I knew Mrs. Carter expected a warm greeting from me, not just a nod from the front desk. I started to move toward her, scissors still in hand, when my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Tom, a parishioner, asking if I had a moment to talk about something weighing on his heart\u2014nothing urgent, just a general inquiry about meeting soon. I felt the familiar tug: the salon expected me to be present, cheerful, and attentive, making every client feel special. But as a priest, I was supposed to be available, a source of comfort, even if just to schedule a future conversation. My mind raced, torn between the immediate warmth Mrs. Carter anticipated and the gentle, persistent call to be there for Tom. I stood frozen, caught between the hum of hairdryers and the silent plea for spiritual guidance, unsure which part of me should answer first."}
