Each time he did, the material wastage increased, and I knew I was expected to step in, guide him, and prevent further loss. My supervisor had made it clear: I was responsible for ensuring smooth operation and training the staff. As I prepared to approach him, the sound of drums and laughter drifted in from outside. Through the window, I saw the vibrant colors of the local festival\u2014today was a special day in our Hindu calendar, and my family would expect me to join the rituals, even if just for a short while. I felt a tug in my chest, torn between my duty to my job and my devotion to my faith. The operator glanced at me, waiting for my guidance, while the festival\u2019s music grew louder, calling me home. I stood there, caught between the hum of the machine and the distant chants, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
