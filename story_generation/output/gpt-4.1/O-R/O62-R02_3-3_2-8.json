As a lifeguard, I knew that high tide was unforgiving\u2014one slip, one missed cry for help, and someone could be lost. My radio crackled, but it was my phone that buzzed insistently. The message was from the Martinez family: their daughter\u2019s sacrament was tomorrow, and they needed me, as their priest, to lead a final, crucial preparation session. They pleaded, reminding me how much this meant to their faith and family. I looked at the sea of bobbing heads, the laughter and shrieks blending with the crash of surf.
