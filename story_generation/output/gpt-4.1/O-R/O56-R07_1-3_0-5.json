Mrs. Lin, a regular, walks in, her face lighting up when she sees me. The receptionist is free, but Mrs. Lin always expects a warm greeting from me, not just a nod. I know she values our little chats, the way I make her feel at home. But my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the weekly meditation group starts in ten minutes, and I\u2019m leading today. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m supposed to be present, mindful, and set an example for the group. They count on me to guide them into stillness, to be calm and centered. My heart pounds as I glance between Mrs. Lin, already waving, and the clock ticking down to meditation. I feel the tug of both worlds\u2014one asking for warmth and attention, the other for stillness and presence. My mind races, torn between the comfort I offer here and the peace I\u2019m meant to cultivate there."}
