The experiment I\u2019d designed for months was finally ready, and the equipment was available tomorrow\u2014a rare opening. I could run the tests, gather the data, and maybe even get a step closer to the answer I\u2019d been chasing. But as I reached for my lab coat, my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes: a special healing service was being held for Sister Maria, who had fallen gravely ill. The service was at the same time as my experiment slot. \n\nAs a scientist, I was expected to seize every opportunity, to be present in the lab, to push the boundaries of knowledge. As a nun, I was expected to be present for my sisters, to pray, to offer comfort and faith in times of need. My heart ached with the weight of both callings. I could hear the hum of the centrifuge in my mind, but also the soft voices of my sisters in prayer. I stood in the hallway, torn, the demands of science and faith pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which door I would walk through."}
