The air was thick with incense, and the sisters\u2019 voices echoed softly through the halls. I glanced at the screen\u2014my new client, Mr. Lee, calling right on time for his check-in. He\u2019d mentioned he was nervous about using the new machine, and I knew he was expecting me to walk him through the basics, to reassure him. But the abbess had asked all of us to be present for Sister Agnes\u2019s healing prayers, a rare and urgent gathering. My heart pounded as I weighed the phone in my hand. The community needed my presence, my prayers, my faith. But Mr. Lee needed my expertise, my calm instructions. I could hear the opening hymn begin, the voices rising in hope, while Mr. Lee\u2019s anxious greeting crackled through the phone. I stood frozen in the corridor, torn between the world of machines and the world of faith, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
