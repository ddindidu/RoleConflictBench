She\u2019s come in for her regular trim, but I know I can\u2019t even begin to cut until I\u2019ve washed and conditioned her hair thoroughly. The tangles are tight, and my scissors would snag and pull, making the experience painful for her. I glance at the clock, feeling the pressure of the next appointment, but also the weight of my other life pressing in.\n\nJust as I reach for the shampoo, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s Sister Agnes, reminding me that Mrs. Delaney from the parish is waiting in the chapel, desperate to talk about her crisis of faith. As a nun, I\u2019m expected to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and spiritual guidance. But here, in the salon, my client expects my full attention and skill. My heart pounds as I try to focus on the task at hand, but my mind is already with Mrs. Delaney, picturing her anxious face. I feel torn, pulled in two directions by the demands of both my callings, unsure which need is greater, or how I can possibly meet them both."}
