A notice from the tax authority flashes on my screen\u2014there\u2019s a discrepancy in a client\u2019s return, and they demand an immediate response. My heart rate spikes as I scan the message, already calculating the steps I\u2019ll need to take to ensure compliance, to protect my client and my reputation as a diligent accountant. But then I glance at the clock. In just a minute, I\u2019m supposed to begin my daily ten-minute meditation, a promise I made to myself to nurture mindfulness, to let go of stress and cultivate peace as a practicing Buddhist.\n\nThe pressure mounts. My mind races with numbers, deadlines, and the fear of making a costly mistake. Yet, another part of me pleads for stillness, for the gentle rhythm of my breath and the quiet sanctuary of meditation. I feel torn\u2014duty and discipline pulling me in one direction, inner peace and spiritual commitment tugging in another. My hands hover over the keyboard, my body tense, as I wrestle with which expectation to honor first."}
