My shift as a taxi driver was almost over, and I was supposed to head home, change into my kurta, and join my family for the puja. Today was an important Hindu ceremony\u2014my parents had reminded me all week how crucial it was to be there on time, dressed properly, to honor our traditions. But just as I was about to turn toward home, a passenger flagged me down, desperate to get to the hospital. My mind raced. As a driver, I was expected to follow every traffic law, drive safely, and not speed, no matter how urgent the fare. But as a son and a Hindu, I was expected to be present at the ceremony, to show respect and devotion. The minutes ticked by, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
