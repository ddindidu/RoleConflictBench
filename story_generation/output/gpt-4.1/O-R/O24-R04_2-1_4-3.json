As a judge, I was expected to write a clear, thorough judgment\u2014thirty days to distill weeks of testimony into findings of fact and law. The legal community, the parties, and my own conscience demanded precision and fairness. Yet, as I glanced at the calendar, I realized Friday was approaching fast. As the imam of our mosque, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah, to guide and inspire the congregation. The community looked to me for spiritual leadership, especially in these uncertain times. \n\nA guest speaker was ready, his sermon prepared, but I knew some would be disappointed if I stepped aside. My heart tugged in two directions: the solemn duty to the law, and the sacred trust of my congregation. I stared at the blank page, feeling the pressure mount, wondering how I could possibly meet the expectations of both worlds without failing one."}
