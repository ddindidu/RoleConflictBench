My phone buzzed, jolting me from my thoughts. Dispatch was calling\u2014an elderly woman had fallen and broken her arm, and I was the closest ambulance driver on shift. I grabbed my keys, heart pounding, sermon notes scattered across the desk. As I sped toward the address, my mind raced with medical protocols: stabilize the arm, manage her pain, reassure her. But the unfinished sermon gnawed at me. My congregation expected guidance, clarity, and inspiration, especially this week after a recent community dispute. I felt torn\u2014my duty to provide immediate care clashed with my responsibility to offer spiritual leadership. The ambulance siren wailed, echoing the turmoil inside me. I wondered if I could truly serve both roles, or if, in trying to meet everyone\u2019s expectations, I was failing them all."}
