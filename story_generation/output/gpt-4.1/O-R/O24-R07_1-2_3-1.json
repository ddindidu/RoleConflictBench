As a judge, I know the importance of clarity and precision\u2014my scheduling order for the new case is due by the end of the week, and the attorneys are already emailing for updates. The law demands my focus, my careful reasoning, and my time. Yet, tonight is the annual memorial service at the temple, a ceremony that holds deep meaning for our Buddhist community. I am expected to be present, to chant, to offer incense, and to support those who grieve. My heart aches with the pull of both worlds: the silent, solitary work of the law and the collective, compassionate rituals of my faith. I feel the weight of expectation from my colleagues and my sangha, each believing their need is most urgent. My mind races, torn between duty and devotion, as the evening shadows lengthen and the decision presses closer."}
