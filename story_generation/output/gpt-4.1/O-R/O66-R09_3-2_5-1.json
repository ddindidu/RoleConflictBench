The construction detour had squeezed the road into a single, narrow lane, and the line of cars behind me grew impatient. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to drive carefully, obey every law, and keep everyone safe, especially with kids so close. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the Jewish holiday was just days away, and my own children still hadn\u2019t learned the blessings. I was supposed to be home early tonight, to sit with them, to pass on the words and melodies my father taught me. The weight of both roles pressed on my chest\u2014one demanding vigilance and patience behind the wheel, the other urging me to hurry home and fulfill my duty as a Jewish parent. The honking behind me grew louder, and I felt torn, caught between the safety of strangers\u2019 children and the spiritual needs of my own."}
