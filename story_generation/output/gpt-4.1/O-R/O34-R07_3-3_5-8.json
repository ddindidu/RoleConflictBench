Every second mattered. I toggled the mic, voice steady, mind racing through procedures. The pilots depended on me for calm, precise guidance. Yet, in the back of my mind, the words of my teacher echoed: \u201cTomorrow, you will share the essence of the Dharma with the sangha.\u201d I had promised to prepare a summary, to reflect deeply, to honor the teachings. But the day had slipped away in a blur of flight paths and radio chatter. Now, as I juggled the urgent needs of the cockpit and the silent call of the temple, I felt the tension coil inside me. The world demanded my focus, my clarity, my compassion\u2014both in the control tower and on the meditation cushion. I stared at the blinking blip on the screen, the pilot\u2019s voice crackling with anxiety, and felt the weight of two worlds pressing in, each asking for all of me."}
