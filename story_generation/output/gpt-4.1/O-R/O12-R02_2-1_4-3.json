Slack notifications pinged relentlessly\u2014product managers and designers from other teams were waiting for my technical input, and the deadline was looming. My mind raced with architecture diagrams and API endpoints, but my phone buzzed with a different kind of urgency. A parishioner had messaged, asking if I might have time to talk, not now, but sometime soon. I knew from experience that \u201csometime\u201d often meant \u201cas soon as you can.\u201d As a priest, I was expected to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and guidance, especially when someone reached out, even tentatively. But as a developer, my team depended on me to deliver, to keep the project moving. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding my technical expertise, the other my compassion. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between drafting a reply and finishing my document, my heart caught in the tension of two callings that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
