Mrs. Lee, my patient, had just learned she had diabetes. Her eyes were wide with worry as she asked question after question\u2014about medication, diet, what her future would look like. I knew she needed my full attention, my empathy, and clear answers to help her face this new reality. But as I tried to reassure her, my phone buzzed with a message from the church secretary: Mark, a longtime member, was waiting in the chapel. He was facing a crossroads in his life and needed spiritual guidance, someone to listen and help him find clarity. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. As a doctor, I was expected to be present, thorough, and compassionate for Mrs. Lee. As a pastor, I was called to offer wisdom and comfort to Mark. My heart pulled in two directions, I wrestled with the fear of letting one down while trying to honor the other."}
