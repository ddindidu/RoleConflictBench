The supplier\u2019s email was blunt: no payment, no more shipments. As the company\u2019s accountant, it was my job to negotiate, to keep the business running smoothly. My manager expected me to find a solution, to communicate with the supplier and somehow resolve the overdue invoice. But as I stared at the growing list of financial obligations, my thoughts drifted to my own savings account. I had been putting aside what little I could each month, hoping to one day fulfill my duty as a Muslim and perform Hajj. Yet, every time an emergency like this arose, I was expected to put the company first, to use my skills and perhaps even my own resources to bridge the gap. The pressure from work clashed with the quiet longing in my heart to save for my pilgrimage. I felt torn, caught between the demands of my profession and the spiritual journey I yearned to make. My hands hovered over the keyboard, uncertain which responsibility should come first."}
