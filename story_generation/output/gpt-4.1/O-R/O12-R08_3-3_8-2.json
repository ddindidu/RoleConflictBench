The production outage was traced back to a bug in my code, and now hundreds of customers couldn\u2019t access the service. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need this fixed tonight.\u201d I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down on me\u2014users were frustrated, the team was counting on me, and I knew I couldn\u2019t let them down.\n\nBut as the clock ticked closer to 8 p.m., my phone buzzed with a reminder: the community Quran study circle was meeting soon. I hadn\u2019t finished reading the verses we were supposed to discuss. I could already imagine the gentle disappointment in my friends\u2019 eyes, the expectation that I would come prepared, ready to reflect and share insights. My faith meant a lot to me, and these gatherings were a source of peace and connection.\n\nI sat at my desk, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the spiritual nourishment I craved. The code editor glowed in front of me, while my Quran sat unopened at my side. My mind raced, caught between two worlds, unsure which to choose."}
