My next client, Mrs. Evans, walked in, her hair damp and clinging to her forehead, clearly just back from the gym. I knew I needed to wash and condition her hair before I could even think about cutting it\u2014she expected nothing less, and I prided myself on my professionalism. As I led her to the sink, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Mark, a member of my congregation. He was in the parking lot, desperate for a few minutes to talk about his crumbling marriage. As a pastor, I was supposed to be there for him, to offer support and guidance whenever needed. But right now, Mrs. Evans was waiting, trusting me to focus on her and give her the best service. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be both the attentive hairdresser and the compassionate pastor at the same time, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
