As a police officer, I was expected to suit up, step into the chaos, and help keep the peace. My radio crackled with urgent updates\u2014tempers were flaring, and the crowd was swelling. I felt the weight of my badge, the responsibility to enforce the law and protect everyone, no matter their side. But my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder: Sister Agnes, could you meet me? I\u2019m struggling with my faith, and I don\u2019t know who else to turn to. The message was from Maria, a parishioner whose quiet desperation I could almost hear in her words. As a nun, I was called to listen, to offer comfort and spiritual guidance, especially in moments like this. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the street, where duty demanded my presence, and toward the chapel, where compassion called me to sit with Maria in her hour of need. I stood frozen, torn between the uniform and the habit, the sirens and the silence, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
