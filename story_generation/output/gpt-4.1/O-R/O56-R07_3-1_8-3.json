She\u2019s my last client before my planned ten-minute meditation\u2014a promise I made to myself to practice mindfulness, to breathe and let go. But her hair is a mess, knotted and heavy with product, and I know it\u2019ll take more than one wash to get it clean enough for a proper cut. She\u2019s already anxious, fidgeting in the chair, expecting me to work my usual magic. I feel the pressure mounting: the professional in me wants to do right by her, to take the time to detangle and condition, but the Buddhist in me aches for that quiet window, the stillness I\u2019ve been craving all day. My hands keep working, but my mind is split, torn between the demands of my craft and the call to sit, breathe, and be present with myself."}
