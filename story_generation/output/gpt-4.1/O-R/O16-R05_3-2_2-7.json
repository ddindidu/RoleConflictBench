As a doctor, I knew every second counted. I needed to diagnose him quickly, to sift through his symptoms and order the right tests before it was too late. My mind raced through possibilities\u2014sepsis, anaphylaxis, a rare infection? The weight of his parents\u2019 desperate eyes pressed on me.\n\nBut my phone buzzed insistently. It was the synagogue\u2019s president. The bar mitzvah was about to begin, and the family was waiting for me to lead the ceremony. Months of preparation, a milestone in a young man\u2019s life, and a community gathered in anticipation. As their rabbi, I was expected to be present, to guide, to bless, to celebrate.\n\nI stood frozen, torn between the sterile urgency of the ER and the joyful expectation at the synagogue. Both roles demanded my full presence, both lives\u2014one physical, one spiritual\u2014hung in the balance. My heart pounded as I weighed the impossible choice, feeling the crushing pressure of two worlds colliding within me."}
