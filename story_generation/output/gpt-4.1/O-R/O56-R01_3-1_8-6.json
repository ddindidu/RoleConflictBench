She chatted about her granddaughter\u2019s graduation, but I could see the heavy product buildup, the way it clumped and resisted my comb. I knew I needed to wash and condition her hair thoroughly before I could even think about cutting it\u2014otherwise, my scissors would snag, and the style would be ruined. \n\nJust then, the conversation in the salon shifted. Someone mentioned last Sunday\u2019s community gathering, and before I knew it, Mrs. Carter turned to me, her eyes bright. \u201cPastor, could you share that story you told us about forgiveness?\u201d The other clients looked up, expectant, waiting for me to teach, to inspire, to be their spiritual guide. \n\nBut my hands were tangled in her hair, my mind on the practical task at hand. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in\u2014one role demanding my skill and focus, the other my wisdom and presence. My heart pounded as I wrestled with which part of myself to honor in that moment, caught between the suds and the sermon."}
