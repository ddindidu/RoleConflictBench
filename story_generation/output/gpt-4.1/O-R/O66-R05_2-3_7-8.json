We\u2019d like to split the fare,\u201d one asked, her voice tired but polite. I nodded, already calculating the best route to their hotel and how to keep the ride smooth and professional. As I reached for the first suitcase, my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. It was a message from the synagogue board: \u201cRabbi, Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s family needs you. She passed away this morning. The funeral must be soon\u2014can you come right away?\u201d My heart clenched. As a rabbi, I knew how much it meant to the family to have me there, to guide them through their grief and honor Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s memory. But as a taxi driver, I had a responsibility to these travelers, who were counting on me for help and a safe ride. I stood there, suitcase in hand, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
