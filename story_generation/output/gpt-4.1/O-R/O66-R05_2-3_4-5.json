Rain blurred the headlights of cars weaving unpredictably around me. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to drive defensively, keep my passengers safe, and obey every traffic law, especially in weather like this. But my phone buzzed with a message from Miriam, the conversion candidate I\u2019d been guiding for months. Her final study session before the Beit Din was in twenty minutes, and she was anxious, needing reassurance and last-minute review. As her rabbi, I was expected to be present, calm, and focused, to help her feel ready for this life-changing moment. My heart pounded as I weighed the risks of hurrying through the rain against the responsibility I felt toward Miriam. The tension between my duty to safety and my calling to teach Torah pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction as the minutes ticked by."}
