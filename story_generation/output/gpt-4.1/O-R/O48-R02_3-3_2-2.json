As a nursing assistant, I was expected to help her eat, to ease her pain, to be present and patient. Her eyes pleaded for comfort, and I felt the weight of her suffering settle on my shoulders. Yet, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the most significant religious holiday of the year was about to begin. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, to offer guidance and hope to a room full of people who looked to me for spiritual nourishment. The chapel would be full, waiting for my words, my presence. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions: the immediate, tangible need of the woman before me, and the spiritual, communal need of those gathering in the sanctuary. My hands trembled as I tried to steady the spoon, my mind racing with the impossible choice between compassion at the bedside and duty at the altar."}
