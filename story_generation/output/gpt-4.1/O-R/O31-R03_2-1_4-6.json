My Bible and journal waited on the desk, promising solace and reflection. As a nun, I cherished these moments\u2014time to listen, to pray, to nurture my spirit. But just as I settled in, my police radio crackled to life: a multi-car accident at the intersection nearby, injuries reported, traffic snarled. Instinctively, I reached for my uniform and badge, duty surging through me. My heart pounded with the familiar urgency to protect, to restore order, to help those in need. Yet, as I stood in the hallway, torn between the sacred silence of my calling and the chaos outside, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. The convent expected my devotion, my presence in prayer; the city needed my strength, my training. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible pull of two lives, each demanding all of me, each refusing to let go."}
