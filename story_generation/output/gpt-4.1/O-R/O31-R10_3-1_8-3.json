As a police officer, I knew the importance of acting with integrity and fairness\u2014my words in court could shape someone\u2019s future. The pressure to be precise and honest weighed heavily on me. Just then, I noticed a colleague quietly slipping ahead in the queue for the coffee machine, bypassing others who had been waiting. As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma, to act ethically even in small matters. My conscience nudged me, reminding me that ignoring minor wrongs could erode my own moral fabric. Yet, I hesitated. Should I confront my colleague and risk creating tension before my important testimony? Or should I let it go, focusing on the larger responsibility awaiting me in court? The expectations of both my roles pressed in on me, and I felt torn, caught between the demands of my badge and the quiet voice of my faith."}
