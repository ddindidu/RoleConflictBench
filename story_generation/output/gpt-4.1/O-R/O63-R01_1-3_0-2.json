Most days, the calls were routine\u2014people listened, asked a few questions, and I answered them with practiced ease. But today, my phone buzzed with a message from a church member, desperate for guidance. She was in crisis, her words trembling with fear and uncertainty, and she needed me to help her navigate a decision that could change her life. My supervisor\u2019s voice crackled in my other ear, reminding me to stay focused, to handle objections and keep the calls moving. Yet my heart ached for the woman who saw me as her shepherd, not a salesperson. The demands of my job pressed in\u2014targets, scripts, efficiency\u2014while the weight of her trust and pain pulled me in the opposite direction. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the call I was supposed to make and the call I needed to answer, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me with every passing second."}
