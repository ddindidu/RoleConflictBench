My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe need five more contracts today, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d I glance at the list of leads, my fingers trembling as I prepare to dial. But my habit, still draped over my chair from morning prayers, catches my eye. I remember Sister Agnes\u2019s gentle reminder that I promised to meet with Maria, a parishioner in deep distress, at noon. She needs guidance, a listening ear, someone to help her find her way back to faith. The weight of both worlds presses on me\u2014my team counting on my calls, Maria counting on my compassion. I feel torn, guilt gnawing at me. If I step away now, I risk letting down my colleagues and facing their disappointment. If I stay, I abandon someone in spiritual need. My heart pounds as I stare at the clock, caught between the demands of my livelihood and my calling, unsure which voice to heed."}
