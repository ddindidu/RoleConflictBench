The contractor\u2019s email blinked on my screen, urging me to approve the next phase. But as I traced the lines of the new stairwell, my heart tightened\u2014something was off. The measurements didn\u2019t meet code, and if left unchecked, someone could get hurt. My phone buzzed again, but I glanced at the clock. It was nearly time for afternoon prayer, the hour I\u2019d set aside for spiritual reading and quiet reflection. The convent was silent, sunlight slanting through stained glass, inviting me to step away from the world\u2019s demands and turn inward. Yet, the weight of responsibility pressed on me. As an architect, I was expected to ensure every detail was safe, every regulation met. As a nun, I was called to stillness, to let go of worldly concerns and seek peace in God\u2019s presence. My mind raced between duty and devotion, the blueprints and the Bible on my desk, each pulling me in opposite directions. I closed my eyes, feeling the tension coil within me, knowing I could not ignore either call."}
