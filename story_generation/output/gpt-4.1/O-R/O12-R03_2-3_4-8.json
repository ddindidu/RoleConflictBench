Slack notifications pinged insistently\u2014reminders that the design documents for our new app feature were due by the end of the week. Product managers and engineers from other teams were waiting for my technical input, and I knew any delay would hold up the entire project. My mind raced with architecture diagrams and user flows, but my heart was heavy with another responsibility. Earlier that day, Mother Superior had gently asked me to lead daily reflections for the upcoming retreat, a role that required deep spiritual study and prayerful preparation. The community looked to me for guidance, expecting thoughtful meditations that would nourish their souls. I felt torn, pulled between the urgent demands of my team and the sacred trust of my sisters. As I stared at the blinking cursor, I wondered how I could possibly meet both expectations, my mind a battleground between code and contemplation."}
