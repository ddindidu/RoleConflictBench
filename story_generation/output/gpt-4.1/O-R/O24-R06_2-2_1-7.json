As a judge, I knew the weight of my responsibility\u2014every detail mattered, every argument needed my full attention. The case was complex, and I owed it to both parties to be as prepared as possible. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from my church group: Sarah, a friend from Bible study, was in crisis. She\u2019d lost her job and was struggling to care for her children. My heart ached for her. As a Christian, I felt compelled to reach out, to offer comfort and practical help, to be present as Jesus would be. But the clock ticked on, and the briefs remained unread. I felt torn, pulled between my duty to the court and my calling to show love and kindness. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
