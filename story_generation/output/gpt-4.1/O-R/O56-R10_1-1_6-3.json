She smiled and told me she\u2019d just washed her hair at home, and I could tell it was clean\u2014soft, fragrant, not a trace of oil. Still, the salon policy was clear: every client\u2019s hair must be washed and conditioned before a cut. My manager expected it, and skipping the wash could get me in trouble. But it felt unnecessary, wasteful even, and I remembered my Hindu values\u2014ahimsa, not causing harm, and satya, being truthful. As I hesitated, I noticed another client quietly slip ahead in the waiting line. My heart tugged at me to speak up, to do what was right, but I worried about causing a scene or upsetting the flow of the busy salon. The weight of these expectations pressed on me: the rules of my job, the principles of my faith, and the comfort of my clients. I stood there, scissors poised, caught between what I was supposed to do and what I felt was right."}
