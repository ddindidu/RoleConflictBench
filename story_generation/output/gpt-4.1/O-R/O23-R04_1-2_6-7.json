As a lawyer, I was used to these networking events, where conversations often danced around cases and clients. Tonight, a colleague leaned in, lowering his voice, \u201cSo, what\u2019s the story with your new client? I\u2019ve heard rumors.\u201d My mind raced\u2014client confidentiality was sacred, and I could not betray that trust, no matter how innocuous the question seemed.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. A message from Ahmed, a devoted member of my mosque, flashed on the screen: \u201cImam, can we meet soon? I really need your guidance.\u201d I felt the weight of his words. As an imam, I was expected to be available, to listen, to offer comfort and wisdom, especially when someone\u2019s family was in distress.\n\nI felt torn. The lawyer in me demanded discretion and distance, while the imam in me urged compassion and presence. Both roles required trust, but the boundaries were different. I could feel the tension tightening in my chest as I tried to decide how to respond, knowing that whatever I chose, I risked disappointing someone who relied on me."}
