The festival had begun just down the street, and the air was thick with the scent of incense and marigolds. As a carpenter, I knew I should keep my workspace tidy\u2014sawdust swept, tools in their place, no stray nails to trip over. Safety was drilled into me, and I took pride in it. But as a Hindu, the pull of the festival was strong. My family expected me to join the prayers, to help with the offerings, to be present in the rituals that connected us to our ancestors. I glanced at the cluttered bench, the half-finished frame, and then at the vibrant procession passing by. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to my craft and the call of my faith. I wiped my hands on my apron, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down, unsure which path to follow."}
