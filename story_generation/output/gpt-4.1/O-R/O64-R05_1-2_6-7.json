I smile at Mrs. Goldstein as she places her groceries on the belt, exchanging pleasantries and making sure to ask about her grandchildren. The store is quiet, and I take pride in making each customer feel welcome, even on slow afternoons like this. My phone vibrates in my pocket, and I glance at the screen\u2014it's a reminder about the bar mitzvah ceremony I\u2019m supposed to officiate in just a few hours. Months of preparation, a young boy\u2019s big day, and a family counting on me to guide them through this sacred milestone. \n\nBut my shift isn\u2019t over, and the manager has already warned me about leaving early.
