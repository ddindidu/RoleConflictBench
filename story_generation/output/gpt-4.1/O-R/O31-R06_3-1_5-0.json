As a police officer, my training kicked in: protect the innocent, stop the threat, use force if necessary. My hand hovered over my holster, heart pounding. But as a Christian, I remembered the teachings of compassion, forgiveness, and the sanctity of every life, even the attacker\u2019s. The crowd\u2019s fear pressed on me, demanding action. Yet, my faith whispered, \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers.\u201d I felt torn\u2014should I act swiftly and forcefully to end the violence, or try to de-escalate, risking more harm but holding true to my beliefs?
