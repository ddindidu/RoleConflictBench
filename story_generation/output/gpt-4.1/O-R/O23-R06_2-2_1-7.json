The deadline for filing was tomorrow, and my client was counting on me to catch every loophole, every hidden clause. My phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a friend from church. Her mother had just been hospitalized, and she was overwhelmed, asking if I could come sit with her for a while. I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in.
