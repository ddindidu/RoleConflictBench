The deadline loomed, and the head surgeon had just called, anxious about the placement of the emergency exits. Every detail mattered\u2014lives would depend on the flow of these hallways, the clarity of the signage, the proximity of the operating rooms. My phone buzzed again. It was the synagogue\u2019s education director, reminding me that the children\u2019s Torah class would begin in an hour. As their rabbi, I was expected to guide them, to answer their questions about faith and tradition, to be present and attentive. I could picture their eager faces, waiting for stories and lessons. But the hospital project demanded my focus; a single oversight could have dire consequences. My mind raced, torn between the urgent needs of my profession and the sacred responsibility of my calling. Both roles called for my full attention, both were non-negotiable. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of expectation pressing in from both sides, my heart pounding as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
