As an ambulance driver, I knew every second mattered. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, adrenaline already surging. But just as I prepared to leave, my phone buzzed. It was the church deacon, voice trembling. A tornado had torn through the neighborhood; families were gathering at the church, desperate for comfort and guidance. As their pastor, they needed me now\u2014someone to pray with them, to offer hope and stability in chaos.\n\nI stood frozen, keys in one hand, phone in the other. The ambulance bay echoed with the expectation that I would save lives on the road. Yet, my congregation\u2019s voices echoed in my heart, pleading for reassurance and support. Both roles demanded my presence, my compassion, my leadership\u2014right now. I felt the weight of two worlds pulling me apart, each expecting me to be their anchor in the storm. My breath caught as I realized I could not be in both places at once."}
