The passenger slid into the back seat, chatting about his meeting, mentioning he had more than enough time. I smiled, nodding, but my mind was elsewhere. Tonight was my turn to chant at synagogue, a responsibility I\u2019d accepted weeks ago. The service would start in less than an hour, and I\u2019d planned my shift so I could leave early. But now, with this ride, I was caught. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to get my passenger to his destination safely and on time, no matter how relaxed his schedule. As a Jew, I\u2019m expected to be present, to honor my commitment to the community and to God. My hands tightened on the wheel. If I cut the ride short or rushed, I\u2019d be failing my duty as a driver. If I stayed too long, I\u2019d miss my place at the bimah. The city lights blurred as I wrestled with the weight of both worlds, unsure which path to follow."}
