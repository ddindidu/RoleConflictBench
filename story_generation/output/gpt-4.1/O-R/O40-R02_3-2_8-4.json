Termites had chewed through the heart of her home, and she was desperate for a repair plan before the next rainstorm. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that Mr. Lee would arrive at the church in an hour, seeking counsel for the burden he\u2019d carried alone for months. As a carpenter, I knew the urgency of Mrs. Hanley\u2019s repairs; her safety depended on my swift action. Yet, as a priest, I felt the weight of Mr. Lee\u2019s trust, his hope that I could offer comfort and guidance. Both needed me, both expected my full attention, and I could not be in two places at once. My hands trembled as I stared at the blueprints and the Bible on my desk, torn between the call to mend broken wood and the call to heal a broken spirit."}
