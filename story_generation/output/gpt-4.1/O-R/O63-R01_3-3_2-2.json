You people always say it\u2019s the best deal, but I\u2019ve been burned before!\u201d My script urged me to stay calm, to handle objections, to win him over with patience and clarity. But my mind kept drifting to the church office, where just an hour ago, I sat across from Maria, her eyes red from crying. She needed guidance, desperate for reassurance that her next step wouldn\u2019t betray her faith or her family. As Mr. Jenkins demanded proof and explanations, my heart ached with the weight of Maria\u2019s trust in me. I was supposed to be her shepherd, her steady voice in the storm, but now I was just a voice on the line, trying to convince a stranger to believe in a product I barely believed in myself. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014one demanding results, the other seeking compassion. My hands trembled as I tried to find the right words, torn between the demands of my job and the calling of my soul."}
