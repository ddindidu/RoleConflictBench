On my desk, a patient\u2019s file lay open, filled with test results and notes. The symptoms didn\u2019t add up\u2014fever, joint pain, a rash that came and went. I\u2019d run every test I could think of, but nothing pointed to a clear diagnosis. As a doctor, I was expected to find answers, to give my patient hope and direction. My mind raced through possibilities, but nothing fit neatly.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Ahmed, a devoted member of my congregation. He sounded desperate, asking if I could meet him soon. He was struggling with family issues, and as his imam, I knew he needed spiritual guidance and a listening ear. I felt the weight of his trust in me, the expectation that I would help him find peace.\n\nI looked at the patient\u2019s file, then at my phone. Both roles demanded my full attention, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart ached as I wrestled with the impossible choice before me, torn between my duty to heal and my calling to guide."}
