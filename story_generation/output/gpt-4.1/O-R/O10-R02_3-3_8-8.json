They threatened to halt all shipments unless we paid the overdue invoice by noon. As the accountant, it was my job to negotiate, reassure, and somehow find a solution before the business ground to a halt. My phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from the parish office. The Martinez family was pleading for a last-minute preparation session for their daughter\u2019s sacrament, scheduled for tomorrow. As their priest, I was expected to guide them, to be present, to ensure their child was ready for this sacred milestone. I could hear the echo of children\u2019s laughter from the church hall, waiting for their lesson, while my mind raced with numbers and deadlines. Both worlds demanded my full attention, both expecting me to be the steady hand in a crisis. My heart pounded as I weighed the urgency of the supplier\u2019s threat against the spiritual needs of my parishioners, feeling the impossible pull of two lives I had chosen, now colliding in a single, breathless moment."}
