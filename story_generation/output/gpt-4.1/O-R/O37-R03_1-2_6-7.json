As a housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to follow every safety and hygiene protocol, especially now, with the flu going around. I\u2019d just finished scrubbing the bathroom floors, my hands raw from the chemicals, when Sister Agnes poked her head in. \u201cSister, Mrs. Callahan is waiting in the chapel. She needs you\u2014she\u2019s struggling with her faith.\u201d\n\nMy heart twisted. As a nun, I was called to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and spiritual guidance. But I looked down at my hands, still gloved, still smelling of disinfectant. I hadn\u2019t finished my cleaning rounds, and the rules were clear: gloves on, hands washed, no exceptions. Yet Mrs. Callahan was waiting, her soul in turmoil, hoping I could help her find peace.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. Should I finish my cleaning, honoring the protocols, or remove my gloves and rush to Mrs. Callahan\u2019s side, risking a breach in hygiene for the sake of her spirit? My mind raced, caught between duty and devotion, unsure which call to answer first."}
