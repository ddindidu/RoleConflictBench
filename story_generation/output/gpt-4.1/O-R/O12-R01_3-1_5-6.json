The architects from three different teams were waiting for my input on the new feature design, and the launch date had just been moved up. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need your decisions by noon, or the whole project stalls.\u201d My mind raced with technical details, trade-offs, and the pressure of not letting everyone down.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the community gathering at church was starting in ten minutes. I was supposed to teach a lesson today, and I\u2019d promised to share a story that would help people find hope. I could already picture the expectant faces, the trust they placed in me to guide them spiritually.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pounding. If I focused on work, I\u2019d let down my congregation. If I left my desk, I\u2019d hold up the entire software team. Both sides needed me, both trusted me, and I couldn\u2019t see how to be enough for both at the same time."}
