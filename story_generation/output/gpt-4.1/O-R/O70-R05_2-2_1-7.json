The next stop was Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s house\u2014her groceries, including the challah for her family\u2019s Shabbat dinner, were in the back. She\u2019d called twice already, her voice tight with worry, reminding me how important it was to have everything before sundown. I promised her I\u2019d be there within the hour. But as I turned onto her street, my phone buzzed. It was the synagogue\u2019s president: the bar mitzvah was starting soon, and the family was anxious. They\u2019d been planning this day for months, and I was expected to lead the ceremony, offer blessings, and guide a young boy through a moment he\u2019d remember forever. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. I could picture Mrs. Goldstein waiting by her window, and at the same time, the congregation gathering, eyes on the bimah, waiting for me. Both needed me, both counted on me, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which promise I would have to break."}
