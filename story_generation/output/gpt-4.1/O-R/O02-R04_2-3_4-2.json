The new safety standard had just come into effect, and as the lead engineer, it was my responsibility to ensure our product met every requirement before tomorrow\u2019s release. The compliance team was waiting for my final review and signature\u2014without it, the launch would be delayed, and the company could face penalties. My phone buzzed. It was the mosque committee: a large crowd had gathered for a special remembrance, and the designated imam was unexpectedly absent. No one else present was authorized to lead the prayer, and the congregation was waiting for me. I could hear the urgency in their voices, the expectation that I would fulfill my duty as imam and guide them in worship.

Both roles weighed heavily on me, each expecting my undivided attention at this critical moment. I felt the tension tightening in my chest, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
