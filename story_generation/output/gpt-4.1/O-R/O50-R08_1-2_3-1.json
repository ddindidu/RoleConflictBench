The machines needed a thorough cleaning\u2014filters replaced, belts checked, every bolt tightened. My supervisor had reminded me twice already: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any downtime after this, so do it right.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders. \n\nBut as I walked home, the call to prayer echoed through the evening air. Ramadan\u2019s midpoint had come, and I was behind on my daily Quran reading. Each night, I promised myself I\u2019d catch up, but fatigue from long shifts and fasting made it hard to focus. My heart ached with guilt; I wanted to honor this sacred month, to recite and reflect as I should. \n\nNow, with the shutdown looming, I felt torn. The machines demanded my full attention, but so did my faith. Could I give both the devotion they deserved? The pressure built inside me, a silent struggle between duty to my work and duty to my soul, and I wondered how I could possibly choose."}
