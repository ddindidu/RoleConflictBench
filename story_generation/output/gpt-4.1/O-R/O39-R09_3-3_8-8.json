Protocol is clear: when the alarm sounds, everyone must evacuate, no exceptions. My foreman\u2019s voice echoes in my head\u2014\u201cNo stragglers, no excuses.\u201d I start toward the muster point with the others, boots crunching gravel, but my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from the synagogue: they need one more for the minyan, the quorum for the funeral prayer. Without me, the prayer can\u2019t happen, and the mourners will be left waiting, their grief suspended. I glance at the huddle of workers ahead, then back at the message. My community expects me to be there, to honor the dead, but my job demands I follow safety rules, stay with my crew. My chest tightens as I weigh the urgency of both calls\u2014one to safety, one to sacred duty. I stand frozen, torn between the blaring alarm and the silent plea of my faith, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
