As a lifeguard, I\u2019m expected to keep everything in order, so when I noticed a few pool chairs misaligned, I felt the familiar tug of responsibility. They weren\u2019t blocking any paths, but I knew the manager liked everything perfect. I hesitated, glancing at my watch. The office function was this afternoon, and I\u2019d already packed my modest outfit\u2014a long-sleeved tunic and loose pants\u2014so I wouldn\u2019t have to change in front of anyone. But right now, I was in my standard lifeguard uniform: shorts and a t-shirt, not exactly what I\u2019d choose if I had a say. \n\nIf I fixed the chairs now, I\u2019d be seen by early swimmers and coworkers, dressed in a way that didn\u2019t align with my beliefs. But if I waited until I changed, I\u2019d risk being called out for not doing my job promptly. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, and I stood by the pool, heart pounding, torn between the expectations of my faith and my duty as a lifeguard."}
