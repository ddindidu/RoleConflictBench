Suddenly, the emergency alarm blared\u2014a passenger needed urgent medical help. My training as a subway operator kicked in: I had to stop the train at the next station, call for assistance, and ensure everyone\u2019s safety. My heart pounded as I prepared to act.\n\nBut just then, I noticed a man quietly slipping ahead in the line of passengers waiting to exit. It was a small act, but as a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma\u2014righteousness\u2014even in minor matters. Should I call out the unfairness, or focus solely on the emergency? My mind raced. The rules of my job demanded my full attention on the medical crisis, but my conscience nagged at me not to ignore the small injustice. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure which duty to honor first."}
