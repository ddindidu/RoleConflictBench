The line snakes past the bakery, and I greet each customer with warmth, asking about their day, offering a kind word. It\u2019s the lunch rush, and my manager expects efficiency and cheerfulness, especially now when tempers run short. But my phone vibrates in my pocket, a message from the mayor: the hurricane has left families without homes, and as Sister Maria, I am needed to organize relief at the church. My heart aches for those suffering, and I know my sisters are counting on me to lead, to comfort, to serve. Yet here I am, tied to this register, expected to be the ever-patient cashier, not the nun in habit. I feel the weight of both uniforms pressing on me, the apron and the veil, each demanding my presence, my compassion, my time. The next customer steps forward, and I force another smile, but inside, I am torn, pulled by the urgent needs of my faith and the immediate demands of my job, unsure which call I can answer."}
