As the lead engineer, management was waiting for my time estimates to finalize the quarterly roadmap. They needed accuracy, commitment, and my technical judgment\u2014no room for delay or uncertainty. But my phone buzzed with messages from my family, reminding me of the upcoming festival. As a Hindu, it was my duty to travel home, to be present for the rituals, to honor my ancestors and the gods. The festival was not just tradition; it was a spiritual anchor, a time when my presence mattered deeply to my family and my faith. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my team and the sacred obligation to my heritage. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to yield. My heart pounded as I tried to reconcile the irreconcilable, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
