The project was still in its early stages, and my manager had emphasized the importance of exploring every possible solution. I knew I should be brainstorming, preparing to present fresh ideas at tomorrow\u2019s meeting. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from Brother Ahmad, a long-time congregant. He asked if I could meet him tonight\u2014he sounded desperate, his family troubles weighing heavily on him. As an imam, I felt the pull of duty, the expectation to offer comfort and guidance when my community needed me most. But as an engineer, I was expected to be thorough and innovative, to give my full attention to the project\u2019s demands. The two roles pressed in on me, each demanding my time, my focus, my heart. I stared at the phone, then at the blueprints, feeling the tension coil inside me, uncertain which call I should answer first."}
