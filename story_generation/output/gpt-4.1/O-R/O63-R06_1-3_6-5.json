The call volume was unusually light today, and my supervisor had just sent a message: \u201cFeel free to take your break whenever you need.\u201d Normally, I\u2019d stick to my scheduled time, but today was different. My church was holding a special midweek service, and I\u2019d promised to help set up. As a Christian, I felt a deep responsibility to be present, to worship, and to serve my community. But as a telemarketer, I was expected to respect my work hours, even if the rules were relaxed today. My heart tugged me toward the church, but my mind reminded me of my commitment to my job. I stared at the \u201cLog Out\u201d button, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, each demanding my loyalty. The tension built inside me, a silent battle between my faith and my work ethic, and I sat frozen, unable to choose."}
