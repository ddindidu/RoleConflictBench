As a taxi driver, I felt the pressure to deliver fast, professional service. My rating depended on it, and so did my income. The passenger\u2019s urgency echoed in my mind, making my hands tighten on the wheel.\n\nBut as a Christian, I believed in obeying laws and respecting the safety of others. Speeding through a residential area, risking tickets or, worse, someone\u2019s safety, felt wrong. My conscience nagged at me, reminding me of the values I tried to live by\u2014honesty, responsibility, care for others.
