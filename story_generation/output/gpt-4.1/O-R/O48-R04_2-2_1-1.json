He winced with every movement, and I could see how much he depended on my gentle hands to help him dress and move. As a nursing assistant, I know my presence is crucial for his comfort and safety. Just as I was about to help him with his shirt, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque committee: the backup imam was still out of town, and the congregation was gathering for the noon prayer. They needed me to lead. I glanced at Mr. Rahman, frail and anxious, and then at the clock. The prayer time was approaching fast. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my duty to care for this vulnerable patient, and my responsibility to guide my community in worship. Both roles demanded my presence, both were urgent, and I felt torn, caught between compassion at the bedside and devotion at the prayer mat."}
