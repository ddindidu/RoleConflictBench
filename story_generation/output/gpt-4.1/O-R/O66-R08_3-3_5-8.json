Children clustered near the curb, their laughter rising above the hum of engines. As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: slow down, stay alert, protect every life. But my mind kept drifting to the letter from my doctor, the one that said my health might not hold out much longer. If I wanted to fulfill my duty as a Muslim and perform Hajj, this year could be my last chance. The thought pressed on me, heavy and urgent. My passengers expected a quick, safe ride, but the detour meant delays, and my own heart ached with the weight of time slipping away. I felt torn\u2014between the responsibility to those on the road and the sacred journey I might never get to make. The children\u2019s voices faded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, my foot hovering over the brake, my mind caught between duty and devotion."}
