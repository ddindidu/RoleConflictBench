It was a little high, and her temperature was above normal too. I knew I should stay and monitor her, maybe even call the nurse to double-check. But it was Sunday morning, and my church service was about to start. I could already imagine the empty seat in the front row where I always sat, the pastor\u2019s eyes searching the congregation, and the gentle disappointment in my friends\u2019 faces if I didn\u2019t show up. My church community counted on me to help with the children\u2019s group today, and I\u2019d promised to lead the opening prayer. Yet, here I was, torn between my duty to care for my patient and my commitment to my faith and church family. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I stood in the hallway, unable to move in either direction."}
