It was just a minor UI glitch\u2014nothing catastrophic, and users could easily work around it. Still, the expectation was clear: fix it now, before the next release. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the children\u2019s religious education class was starting in thirty minutes. I was supposed to be there early, to set up the room and greet the families. The parish counted on me to guide their children, to be present and attentive, not distracted by work. But my team was counting on me too, and I could already imagine the messages piling up if I left this bug unresolved. My mind raced, torn between the code on my screen and the lesson plan in my bag. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
