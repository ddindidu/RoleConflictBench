The operator, Mark, was at it again\u2014fiddling with the machine\u2019s settings, ignoring the guidelines I\u2019d explained just yesterday. The whir of the conveyor was punctuated by the clatter of wasted material, piling up faster than I could count. My job demanded I step in, guide him firmly, maybe even report the repeated mistakes. But as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed with a reminder: church service in thirty minutes. I\u2019d promised myself, and my congregation, that I\u2019d be there\u2014worshipping, connecting, being present in faith and fellowship. The expectation was clear: my presence mattered, not just to me, but to the community that counted on me. Yet here I was, torn between my duty to guide Mark and prevent further waste, and my commitment to my faith. My heart pounded as I weighed the disappointment I\u2019d cause on either side, feeling the tension coil tighter with every wasted sheet and every passing minute."}
