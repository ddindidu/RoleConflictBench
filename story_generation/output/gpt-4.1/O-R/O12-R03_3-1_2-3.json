The logs were clear: the new functions I\u2019d written last night were bottlenecking under load, and users were already complaining. My team expected me to fix it\u2014quickly, cleanly, no shortcuts. I flexed my fingers, ready to dive into the code, when the chapel bell tolled. Morning prayer. The sisters would be gathering now, their voices rising in gentle harmony, and I was expected to be there, present in body and spirit, as I had vowed. My habit felt heavy on my shoulders, my laptop warm beneath my palms. I glanced at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d be late for prayers; if I stayed, I\u2019d let my team and our users down. The weight of both worlds pressed in, each demanding my full devotion, and I sat frozen, torn between the call of code and the call to prayer."}
