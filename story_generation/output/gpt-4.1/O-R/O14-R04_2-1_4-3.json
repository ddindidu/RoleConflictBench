The departmental meeting was in two hours, and as a scientist, I was expected to present our preliminary findings with precision and honesty. My supervisor had emphasized the importance of accuracy, especially since our research could influence future funding. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: Friday prayer was approaching. As the imam, the congregation looked to me for guidance and inspiration during the Khutbah. I knew an invited guest speaker was ready to step in, but some community members had expressed how much they valued my presence and words, especially during these uncertain times. My mind raced between the responsibility to my research team and the spiritual needs of my community. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt the weight of expectation pressing from both sides. I sat at my desk, heart pounding, torn between the lab and the mosque, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
