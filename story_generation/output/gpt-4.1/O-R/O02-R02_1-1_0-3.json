The project I\u2019m working on is still in its early stages, and my manager has made it clear that nothing is set in stone yet\u2014there\u2019s room for creative thinking, for proposing alternatives later. Still, I feel the pressure to be prepared, to have answers ready for the next meeting.\n\nAt the same time, as a priest, I\u2019m called to be present for my parishioners, to offer guidance and a listening ear. Today, after the service, a parishioner approached me, asking if we could schedule a chat sometime soon. It wasn\u2019t urgent, just a gentle request for support in the near future.\n\nI feel the tension rising inside me. The engineer in me wants to dive into research, to sketch out new ideas before the next project discussion. The priest in me knows that even a tentative request for spiritual guidance deserves my attention and care. I find myself torn, wondering how I can honor both roles when their demands, though not immediate, seem to pull me in different directions."}
