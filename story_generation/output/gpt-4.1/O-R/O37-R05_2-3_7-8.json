I paused, peeling off a glove with a snap, and saw the message: \u201cRabbi, my father just passed. We need you for the funeral\u2014today, if possible.\u201d My heart clenched. As a housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to follow every safety and hygiene protocol, especially now, with new rules about protective gear and handwashing. I glanced at the untouched mop bucket, the checklist taped to my cart, and the clock ticking toward my next cleaning round. But as a rabbi, I was needed\u2014urgently. The family would expect me to drop everything, to be present, to guide them through their grief. I felt the weight of both uniforms: the crisp, practical scrubs and the rabbinic tallit folded in my locker. My supervisor would not understand if I left mid-shift, but the family would not understand if I delayed. I stood in the hallway, torn, the demands of both worlds pressing in, unsure which duty to answer first."}
