The phone queue was relentless, and management had sent out another reminder: \u201cNo unscheduled breaks. We\u2019re watching the logs.\u201d My scheduled break was still an hour away, but my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014church service started in fifteen minutes. I\u2019d promised myself, and God, that I\u2019d be present every week, not just for worship but to help with the community meal afterward. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations. If I left my desk now, I\u2019d risk a write-up or worse. But if I stayed, I\u2019d miss the service, let down my church family, and feel the ache of breaking my commitment.
