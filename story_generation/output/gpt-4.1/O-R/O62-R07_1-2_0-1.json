My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cNever take your eyes off the swimmers, even for a second.\u201d A few kids drift toward the deep end, but they\u2019re laughing, splashing, not in trouble\u2014at least not yet. Still, I know how quickly things can change. My Buddhist sangha is gathering at the temple tonight for a memorial service, a ceremony I promised to attend. The community expects my presence, my support, my prayers. I feel the weight of their anticipation, the importance of honoring the departed together. But my shift runs late, and the pool is busy. I can\u2019t leave early without risking someone\u2019s safety, but if I stay, I\u2019ll miss the ritual, disappoint my teacher, and let down my friends. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward the calm of the temple and the restless water before me. I grip the whistle around my neck, torn between duty and devotion, unsure which call to answer."}
