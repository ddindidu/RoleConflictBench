As a police officer, I was expected to remain impartial, to listen carefully, and to act with integrity and fairness. My badge weighed heavily on my chest as I took notes, trying to keep my own frustration in check. Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from a young couple who had asked if I could officiate their wedding next year. As a rabbi, I knew how important it was to be present for these moments, to offer guidance and support, to help shape the beginning of a new family. But the department had just posted the new shift schedule, and I was likely to be on duty that weekend. I felt the tension coil inside me, the demands of my uniform and my calling pulling me in opposite directions. The drivers looked to me for a decision, while the couple waited for my answer. I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure how to honor both."}
