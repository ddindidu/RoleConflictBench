The pool was crowded, laughter echoing off the tiles, but my focus was sharp\u2014every movement, every splash, I watched for signs of trouble. Suddenly, I noticed a swimmer in the middle, their strokes faltering, head bobbing awkwardly. My muscles tensed, ready to leap in if needed.\n\nBut then, my phone buzzed. A reminder: the main weekly service was about to begin. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, offer guidance, and be present for everyone. They counted on me for spiritual support, especially today. My heart pounded. If I left now, I\u2019d abandon my post, risking the safety of everyone in the pool. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down my congregation, who looked to me for comfort and leadership.\n\nThe weight of both uniforms pressed on me, the whistle and the collar. I stared at the struggling swimmer, then at the clock, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds demanding all of me at once."}
