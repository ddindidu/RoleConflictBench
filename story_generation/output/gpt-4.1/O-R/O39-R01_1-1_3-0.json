As a construction laborer, I knew the foreman expected every inch of my area to be spotless before I left. Safety and order\u2014those were the rules. I grabbed the broom, already thinking about the aching in my back, when my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. \u201cCan you talk? I really need some guidance.\u201d I could almost hear the tremor in her words. As a pastor, I was supposed to be there for her, to offer comfort and spiritual support, especially when someone reached out in distress. But the clock was ticking, and if I didn\u2019t finish cleaning, I\u2019d be letting my crew down, risking a reprimand or worse. My hands tightened on the broom handle as I stared at the message, torn between the demands of my worksite and the call to shepherd my flock. The weight of both worlds pressed in, and I stood there, caught in the space between duty and compassion, unsure which path to take."}
