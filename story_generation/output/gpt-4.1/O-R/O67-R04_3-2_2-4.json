A multi-vehicle collision on the highway, critical injuries, and I was the closest ambulance driver on shift. My phone buzzed with reminders from the mosque committee\u2014today\u2019s Khutbah was important, the congregation was expecting me, and the topic had already been announced. I could picture the rows of worshippers, waiting for guidance, for words of comfort and unity. At the same time, I imagined the chaos on the highway, the desperate faces, the urgency in their voices as they waited for help. My hands trembled as I reached for my keys, torn between the siren\u2019s call and the pulpit\u2019s duty. Both roles demanded my presence, both lives and souls depended on me. The weight of expectation pressed down, and I felt split in two, unable to ignore either plea."}
