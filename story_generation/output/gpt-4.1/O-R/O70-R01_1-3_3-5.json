The house was quiet, no car in the driveway, no lights on. As a delivery person, I knew the rules: leave the package somewhere safe, snap a photo, confirm delivery. I glanced at my phone, ready to mark the job complete, when it buzzed with a message from the church council. There\u2019d been a fire at Mrs. Lee\u2019s house\u2014she\u2019d lost everything. As her pastor, I was expected to be there, to comfort her, to organize help. My mind raced. If I left now, I\u2019d risk the package being stolen or damaged, failing my duty as a delivery person. But if I stayed to secure the delivery, I\u2019d be late to support Mrs. Lee, letting down my congregation in their moment of crisis. My heart pounded as I stood on the porch, torn between two worlds, both demanding my presence, both unwilling to wait."}
