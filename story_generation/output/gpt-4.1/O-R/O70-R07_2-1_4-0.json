The package in my hands wasn\u2019t especially expensive, but company policy was clear: I needed a signature. I buzzed the recipient\u2019s apartment, waiting, shifting my weight from foot to foot. My mind kept drifting to the temple, where the evening chant would begin in less than half an hour. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be there, to join the community in reciting the sutras, to help create the calm, collective energy that soothed us all after a long day.\n\nBut here I was, still waiting, the minutes ticking by. If I left the package without a signature, I\u2019d be breaking the rules, risking my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the ritual, letting down my fellow practitioners and, in a way, myself. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cChanting at 7:00.\u201d I felt the tension coil in my chest, torn between the duty to my work and the pull of my spiritual community, both demanding my presence, both unwilling to wait."}
