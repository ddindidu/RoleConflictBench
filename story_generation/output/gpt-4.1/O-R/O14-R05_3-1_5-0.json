The journal\u2019s submission portal blinks at me, a silent reminder that the deadline is less than forty-eight hours away. My data is solid, but the analysis needs one more careful review, and the report must be flawless\u2014my reputation as a scientist depends on it. Yet, as I reach for another article, my phone buzzes with a message from the synagogue board: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to start preparing your Shabbat sermon. The community is eager to hear your insights.\u201d I know they expect thoughtful, inspiring words, and the process of crafting a meaningful sermon takes time\u2014time I don\u2019t have right now.
