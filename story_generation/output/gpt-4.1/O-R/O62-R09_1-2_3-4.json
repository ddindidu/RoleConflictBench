The sun was dipping low, and I noticed a few pool chairs were slightly misaligned. Technically, they were still usable, but the facility manager always expected everything to be perfectly arranged before closing. I glanced at my watch\u2014if I took the time to fix the chairs, I\u2019d miss my chance to grab dinner at the only kosher vendor nearby, which closed soon. As a Jew, keeping kosher is non-negotiable for me, even when traveling. My stomach rumbled, reminding me I hadn\u2019t eaten since morning. The pressure built inside me: the responsibility to uphold my job\u2019s standards versus my commitment to my faith. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, knowing I had to choose which expectation to meet."}
