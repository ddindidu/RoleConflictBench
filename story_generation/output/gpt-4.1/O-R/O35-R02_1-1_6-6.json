My phone buzzed with an email from the transit authority: a professional development seminar, optional but strongly encouraged. I knew the expectation\u2014always stay sharp, keep up with the latest safety protocols, show commitment to the job. I started drafting a response, but my calendar notification chimed. The parish committee was waiting for me to help plan the next adult faith formation series. As a priest, I was expected to guide, inspire, and organize these classes, and the community relied on me to set the tone for the season. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds. If I signed up for the seminar, it might conflict with the planning meetings. If I prioritized the church, would my supervisors see me as less dedicated? My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, torn between the tracks and the altar, between duty and devotion."}
