The sun was dipping low, and the swimmers were thinning out, but I couldn\u2019t let my guard down. My mind kept drifting to the Buddhist study circle meeting tonight. We were supposed to discuss a chapter on mindfulness, and I hadn\u2019t read it yet. I felt the weight of my commitment to the group, the expectation to be present, thoughtful, and prepared. But here, right now, my duty was to these swimmers. Suddenly, I noticed a young man in the middle of the pool, his strokes faltering, head bobbing awkwardly. My body tensed, every sense alert. I knew I couldn\u2019t look away, not even for a moment, not even to glance at the book in my bag. The pressure built inside me\u2014my desire to honor my spiritual path clashing with the responsibility to protect lives. I felt torn, heart pounding, as I watched the struggling swimmer and thought of the circle waiting for me, expecting my insight."}
