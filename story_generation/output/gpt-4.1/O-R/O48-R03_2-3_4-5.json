Still, protocol demanded I monitor her closely, especially after her recent surgery. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cAccuracy and vigilance save lives.\u201d I knew I should stay, recheck her vitals, and document any changes. But my heart pounded for another reason. Today, I was chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the cathedral, representing my convent. The sisters had prayed for this honor, and I was expected to be there, robed and ready, in less than an hour. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me: the crisp scrubs of a nursing assistant, the habit of a nun. I could not be in two places at once. If I left Mrs. Thompson, I might miss a crucial change in her condition. If I stayed, I would let down my sisters and the community. My hands trembled as I held the chart, torn between duty and devotion, feeling the impossible pull of both callings."}
