I glanced at the clock\u2014thirty minutes since the main production unit had stalled, the supervisor\u2019s message blinking urgently: \u201cSensor errors again. We need you.\u201d My toolbox was already by the door, but my Bible lay open on the desk, pages marked for this afternoon\u2019s reflection. Sister Agnes had just told me a parishioner was waiting in the chapel, desperate to talk about her crisis of faith. I could picture her, hands clasped, eyes searching for comfort I was expected to provide. My mind raced: the factory needed me to diagnose and fix the machine, every minute costing them dearly. But the parishioner needed me to listen, to offer spiritual guidance and compassion. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the oil-stained overalls and the habit\u2014pressing on my shoulders, each demanding my presence, each expecting my full attention. My heart pounded as I stood between the humming silence of the chapel and the mechanical urgency of the factory, torn by the impossible choice."}
