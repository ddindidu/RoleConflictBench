The app pinged again\u2014a passenger, impatient, messaged for the third time, \u201cPlease hurry, I\u2019m late!\u201d I was supposed to pick them up ten minutes ago, but traffic was crawling. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on punctuality and professionalism. My rating depended on it, and so did my income.\n\nBut today was different. My family was waiting at home, the house fragrant with incense and marigold garlands. It was the day of an important Hindu ceremony, and I was expected to arrive on time, dressed in my clean kurta, to join the prayers and rituals. My mother had called twice already, reminding me not to be late, her voice tinged with hope and expectation.\n\nCaught between the urgent demands of my passenger and the sacred pull of my family\u2019s ceremony, I felt my chest tighten. I could see my kurta folded neatly on the seat beside me, a silent reminder of my other role. The minutes ticked by, and I wrestled with the impossible choice, torn between duty to my passenger and devotion to my faith and family."}
