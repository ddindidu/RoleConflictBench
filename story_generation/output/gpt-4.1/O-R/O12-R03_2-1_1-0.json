The new feature is almost done, but the code review pings keep coming\u2014warnings about performance, suggestions for cleaner logic. My team expects excellence, and I pride myself on delivering it. But today, my habit hangs on the back of my chair, a silent reminder that I am also Sister Maria, and the convent\u2019s monthly food drive starts in less than an hour. The sisters are counting on me to help pack meals, to offer comfort and prayer to those who come hungry. My heart aches with the weight of both worlds: the drive to perfect my code, the call to serve with compassion. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and as I hover over my keyboard, I feel the tension coil tighter inside me, unsure which duty I will let down."}
