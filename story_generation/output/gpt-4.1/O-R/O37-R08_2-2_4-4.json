I\u2019m responsible for making sure all supplies are stocked, and the next cleaning is just a few days away. I should go out and buy more today, but there\u2019s an office function this afternoon\u2014one where everyone, men and women, will be present. As a Muslim, I always make sure to dress modestly, covering my arms and legs, and wearing my hijab. But the only clean clothes I have left are my work uniform: short-sleeved and not as loose as I\u2019d like. If I go out now to buy supplies, I\u2019ll have to wear it, and I worry about not meeting my religious expectations. If I wait until after the function, the store might close, and I\u2019ll fail my responsibility as a cleaner. My mind spins with anxiety, torn between my duty to my job and my commitment to my faith, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
