Up ahead, the yellow sign warned: SCHOOL ZONE. Children clustered near the curb, some darting dangerously close to the street. My job demanded I drive defensively, obey every law, especially here. But then, my phone buzzed\u2014a desperate message from a regular passenger, Mrs. Evans. Her husband was in the hospital, and she begged me to get her there as fast as possible. She pleaded, \u201cPlease, I need you. God bless you.\u201d My heart twisted. As a Christian, I felt called to help, to show compassion and urgency in her crisis. But the law was clear: slow down, protect the children. My mind raced, torn between my duty to the safety of these kids and my faith\u2019s call to serve someone in need. The pressure built inside me, a storm of responsibility and conscience, as I approached the crosswalk, unsure which role I could honor without betraying the other."}
