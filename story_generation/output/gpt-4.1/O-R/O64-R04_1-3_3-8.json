The numbers didn\u2019t quite add up\u2014just a small discrepancy, a few dollars off, nothing that would change the total sales. Store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, no exceptions. My manager expected me to report even the smallest irregularity, and I knew the importance of honesty in this job. But as I closed the register, my phone buzzed. A message from the mosque: someone had arrived, desperate for guidance after a devastating loss. As the imam, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and wisdom in moments of crisis. My heart ached for the person waiting for me, but I was still at the store, bound by my duty to resolve the cash issue before leaving. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding strict adherence to procedure, the other calling for immediate compassion. I felt torn, standing at the crossroads of responsibility, unsure which expectation to fulfill first."}
