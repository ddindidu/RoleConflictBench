They were about to start a batch that, if mishandled, could cause a serious accident. I knew I had to step in, explain the safety protocols, and guide them through the process.

I could already picture the expectant faces at the mosque, relying on me for spiritual guidance and routine. My heart pounded as I glanced between the anxious workers and the clock ticking toward prayer time. Both groups needed me, both for reasons that felt urgent and important.
