The flagged safety issue was serious\u2014if I didn\u2019t address it now, the plant could be shut down, and my team would face consequences. As the lead engineer, everyone looked to me for answers, and the clock was ticking. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: Friday prayer was in less than an hour. As the imam, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah, a responsibility I never took lightly. The congregation counted on me for guidance and inspiration, especially today, when a sensitive topic was on the agenda. \n\nI knew the guest speaker was ready and willing to step in, but I also knew some community members would be disappointed if I wasn\u2019t there. My heart pounded as I weighed the urgency of the safety issue against the spiritual needs of my community. Both roles demanded my presence, my leadership, and my integrity. I felt torn, the weight of expectation pressing from both sides, unsure which duty I should honor first."}
