He winced with every movement, and I knew he needed my full attention\u2014every step, every button on his shirt mattered. As I steadied him, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from the church council: a family in our congregation had just lost their home in a fire. They needed me to organize support and offer comfort right away. My heart twisted. Here, in this quiet hospital room, Mr. Jenkins depended on me for his dignity and safety. But out there, my community was reeling, looking to me for guidance and hope. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to be fully there. I stood between Mr. Jenkins and the window, torn by the impossible choice, my hands trembling as I tried to focus on the task before me."}
