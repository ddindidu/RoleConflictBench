The foreman\u2019s shout cut through the clatter: \u201cWe need you here, now!\u201d A massive steel beam dangled from the crane, swaying slightly in the breeze. My job was to help guide it into place, steady hands and sharp focus required\u2014any mistake could mean disaster. I grabbed my gloves, heart pounding, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Brother Yusuf, a voice I knew well from the mosque. \u201cImam, please, I need to talk. It\u2019s urgent\u2014my family is falling apart. Can you meet me soon?\u201d His voice trembled with desperation. I glanced at the beam, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down. The crew expected my strength and attention; my community needed my compassion and guidance. I stood frozen, torn between the steel and the soul, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
