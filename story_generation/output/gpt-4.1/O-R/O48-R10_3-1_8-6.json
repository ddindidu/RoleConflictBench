She had just received news about her illness, and I knew she needed someone to sit with her, to offer comfort and a listening ear. As a nursing assistant, I felt the weight of my responsibility\u2014to be present, to provide emotional support, to not let her feel alone in this moment of fear.\n\nBut as I stepped into the hallway, the scent of incense drifted in from outside. Through the window, I caught sight of the vibrant colors and music of the local festival\u2014today was a special Hindu celebration, one I had been looking forward to for weeks. My family and community expected me to join, to participate in the rituals and prayers, to honor our traditions.\n\nI stood frozen, torn between the call of my faith and the needs of my patient. My heart ached with the pressure of both worlds, each demanding my presence, each pulling me in a different direction. I could feel the conflict rising inside me, unsure which path to take."}
