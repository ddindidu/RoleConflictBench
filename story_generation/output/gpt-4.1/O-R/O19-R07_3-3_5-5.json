I glanced at the patient in front of me, an elderly woman with a bag full of prescriptions\u2014blood thinners, diabetes meds, a new heart pill. She looked anxious, clutching her list of questions. As a pharmacist, I knew I couldn\u2019t rush this. She needed careful counseling to avoid dangerous interactions, and I was the only one here with the expertise. But as a Buddhist, I was expected to be present for my sangha, to guide them in mindfulness and stillness. They relied on me to open the session, to set the tone for our practice. My mind tugged in two directions: the duty to my patient\u2019s safety, and the commitment to my spiritual community. I felt my breath quicken, the irony not lost on me\u2014a mindfulness teacher, now anything but mindful, caught between two worlds, both demanding my full attention."}
