It\u2019s a ritual I\u2019ve followed since childhood, a quiet moment to connect with the divine and honor my Hindu faith. But as a telemarketer, my life is ruled by the clock and the relentless ping of the compliance system. My breaks are scheduled to the minute, and any unscheduled downtime is flagged. Today, my break is set for 5:00 p.m., but I can already feel the anxiety building as the clock nears 4:30. My heart pounds as I imagine the lamp sitting unlit, the prayers unsaid, while I\u2019m tethered to my headset, reciting the same sales pitch. I know my family expects me to keep up the tradition, and I expect it of myself too. But the thought of risking a warning\u2014or worse, my job\u2014by stepping away from my desk even for five minutes fills me with dread. I stare at the clock, torn between the demands of my faith and the rigid rules of my workplace, feeling the weight of both pressing down on me."}
