The numbers had to match, every cent accounted for, and the deadline for closing the books loomed just hours away. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for Maghrib prayer. As the imam, I was expected to lead, to be present for the congregation, even if tonight the group was small and another brother, fully capable, was already there. My mind raced. The mosque valued my presence, my voice guiding the prayer, my calm steadiness. But the office demanded precision, focus, and my undivided attention. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the silent expectation from my colleagues to finish the accounts, and the quiet hope from the worshippers that I would appear, as always, to lead them. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the ledger and the prayer mat, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
