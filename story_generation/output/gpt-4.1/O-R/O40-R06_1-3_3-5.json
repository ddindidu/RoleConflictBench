The client wanted a custom dining set, and I needed to estimate the materials and place the order by tonight if I wanted to meet the deadline. My mind raced through measurements and supply lists, but the church bell rang in the distance, reminding me of the evening service. As a Christian, I was expected to be there, not just to worship but to help set up for the community dinner afterward. My pastor had spoken to me last week about the importance of consistency and fellowship. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my hands itching to get back to the blueprints, my heart tugged toward the church doors. I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and the thought of letting someone down\u2014either my client or my church family\u2014made my chest tighten. I stared at the unfinished plans on my workbench, torn between the demands of my craft and the call of my faith, unsure which path to take."}
