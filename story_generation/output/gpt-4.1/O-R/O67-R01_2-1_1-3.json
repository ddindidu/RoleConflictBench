As an ambulance driver, I knew every second mattered. I gripped the wheel, ready to weave through the maze of cars. But just as I reached for the siren, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Carter, a gentle soul from my congregation. Her husband had passed last month, and she\u2019d been struggling. \u201cFeeling low today,\u201d she wrote. \u201cCould use a prayer or a call.\u201d As her pastor, I was expected to be there, to offer comfort, to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. My heart twisted. The city outside demanded urgency; a patient waited in pain. But Mrs. Carter\u2019s loneliness pressed on me, too. I stared at the dashboard, torn between the wail of duty and the quiet ache of compassion, feeling the weight of both uniforms I wore."}
