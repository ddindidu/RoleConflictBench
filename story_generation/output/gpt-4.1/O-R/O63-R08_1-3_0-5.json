Friday prayers would begin soon, and I needed to leave for the mosque. My manager had just handed out new company shirts\u2014bright, short-sleeved, and required for all staff today. I hesitated, knowing the shirt didn\u2019t meet my standards for modest dress. At work, I was expected to handle customer questions with confidence, and the script made it easy. But now, as I prepared to enter the main prayer hall, I felt the weight of another expectation: to dress modestly, as my faith required. My colleagues were already changing, urging me to hurry so we could all leave together. I stared at the shirt, my heart pounding, torn between the company\u2019s demand for uniformity and my own need to honor my beliefs. The mosque was only a few blocks away, but the distance between these two parts of myself felt impossible to cross."}
