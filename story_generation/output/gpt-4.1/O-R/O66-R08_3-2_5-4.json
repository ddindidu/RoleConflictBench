The construction detour had squeezed the road into a single, narrow lane, and the line of impatient cars behind me grew longer by the second. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to follow every traffic law, especially here\u2014one wrong move could endanger a child. But my mind kept drifting to the office function scheduled for this afternoon. My colleagues, men and women both, would be there, expecting me to blend in, to look professional. As a Muslim, I felt the weight of my faith\u2019s expectation to dress modestly, to represent my beliefs with dignity. I worried about how my attire would be perceived\u2014too traditional, too different? The pressure to fit in tugged at me, just as the responsibility to drive safely pressed on my conscience. My heart pounded as I inched forward, torn between the demands of my job and my faith, feeling the tension rise with every passing moment."}
