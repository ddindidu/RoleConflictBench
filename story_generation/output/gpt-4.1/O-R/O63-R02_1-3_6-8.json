The call volume was unusually light today, and my supervisor had already mentioned we could be flexible with our breaks. I felt a rare sense of ease, thinking I might use the extra time to catch my breath. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from the parish office: a family needed a last-minute, mandatory preparation session for their child\u2019s sacrament\u2014tonight, the only time they could all be together before the big day. As a priest, I knew how important this was, not just for the child but for the entire family\u2019s spiritual journey. But as a telemarketer, I was expected to respect my work hours, even if the rules were relaxed today. My mind raced, torn between the quiet responsibility of my day job and the sacred duty that called me. I stared at my computer screen, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
