Only an hour left in my shift, and I was still three sales short of my weekly target. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my mind kept drifting to the evening ahead. Tonight was the puja at my uncle\u2019s house\u2014a family ceremony I couldn\u2019t miss. My mother had called twice already, reminding me to come straight home, change into my kurta, and help with the preparations. The thought of disappointing my family, of missing the prayers and the laughter, twisted in my chest. Yet, the pressure to perform at work was just as heavy. If I left now, I\u2019d fall short of my target, risking my bonus and maybe even my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late for the ceremony, letting down my family and my faith. My hands trembled as I stared at the phone, torn between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
