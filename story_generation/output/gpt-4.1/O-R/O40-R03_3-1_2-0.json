As a carpenter, I know the importance of inspecting every tool before starting the day\u2019s structural work. The circular saw\u2019s blade looked dull, and the drill\u2019s cord was frayed\u2014both hazards that could lead to serious injury if ignored. My hands itched to get to work, to ensure everything was safe and ready for the team. But as a nun, I was also expected at the convent\u2019s kitchen, where the sisters were already bustling about, preparing for the monthly food drive. The shelter depended on us, and my absence would mean fewer hands to pack meals for those who needed them most. I could almost hear Sister Agnes\u2019s gentle reminder: \u201cCharity is our highest calling.\u201d Yet, the foreman\u2019s words echoed too: \u201cSafety first, always.\u201d My heart pounded as I glanced between the toolbox and the clock, torn by the weight of both responsibilities, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
