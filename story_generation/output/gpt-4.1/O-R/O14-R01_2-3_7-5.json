The safety audit was in two hours, and I knew the university expected nothing less than perfection. My mind raced through the protocols, the repairs, the forms I still needed to sign. Then my phone buzzed\u2014three missed calls from the church deacon. A tornado had torn through the outskirts of town, and several families from our congregation had lost their homes. They needed me at the community center, now, to offer comfort and organize emergency support. I could almost hear the voices of my colleagues, reminding me of my duty to the lab, and the voices of my congregation, desperate for reassurance and guidance. My hands trembled as I weighed the sterile, logical world of the lab against the raw, immediate pain of my community. Both needed me, both expected me to be present, to lead, to fix what was broken. I stood frozen, torn between the hum of the equipment and the distant wail of sirens, unable to move."}
