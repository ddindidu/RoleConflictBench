The package on the seat beside me was marked \u201cConfidential\u2014Recipient Only,\u201d and my supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cNo exceptions. Confirm ID, hand it over in person.\u201d I\u2019d never handled something this important before, and I knew how much trust the company was placing in me. But as I pulled up to the address, my phone buzzed with a reminder: synagogue services started in fifteen minutes. I\u2019d promised my family I\u2019d be there, and I could already picture my father\u2019s disappointed look if I missed another week. The congregation would be fine without me, but I felt the weight of my commitment to my faith and community. I stared at the package, then at the synagogue\u2019s address on my phone, feeling torn. The responsibility of my job pressed against the quiet, persistent pull of my religious life, and I sat frozen, wrestling with which expectation I would have to let down."}
