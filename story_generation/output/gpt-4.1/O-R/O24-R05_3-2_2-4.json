They need your ruling within the hour.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014forty-five minutes until the children would gather in the synagogue classroom, waiting for me, their rabbi, to guide them through this week\u2019s Torah portion. My mind raced. As a judge, I was expected to pore over every detail, to ensure justice was served swiftly and fairly, especially in urgent matters like this. But as a rabbi, I was the anchor for these children, the one who made ancient words come alive, who answered their questions and shaped their faith. I could not be in two places at once. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cReligious school in 30 minutes.\u201d My heart pounded. I imagined the disappointed faces of the children, the anxious parties awaiting my ruling. Both roles demanded my full presence, my undivided attention. I stared at the file, then at my Torah notes, feeling the impossible pull of duty from both sides, unsure which part of myself to betray."}
