The beach was packed, high tide swelling the water dangerously close to the shore. Every instinct as a lifeguard screamed at me to stay vigilant\u2014one slip, one missed cry for help, and someone could be lost. Yet, my phone buzzed in my pocket, a gentle reminder from Sister Agnes: the special healing service for Sister Maria was about to begin. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to pray and offer comfort, especially now when faith and community were needed most. My heart pounded with guilt and anxiety.
