The client wanted every inch to serve a purpose, every workspace to foster productivity. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for Asr prayer. I glanced at the clock. The mosque was only a few blocks away, and as the imam, I was expected to lead the prayer. But today, the congregation would be small, and Brother Ahmed, always punctual and capable, was there to step in. Still, I knew some worshippers valued my presence, expecting guidance and consistency. My mind tugged in two directions: the pressing deadline for the office design, and the quiet responsibility of leading prayer. I felt the weight of both roles, the architect\u2019s duty to deliver excellence, and the imam\u2019s call to spiritual leadership. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the needs of my profession and the expectations of my faith community, uncertain which path to choose."}
