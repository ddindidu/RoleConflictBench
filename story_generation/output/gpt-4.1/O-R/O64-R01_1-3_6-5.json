The store was quiet, and I found comfort in the routine, the beep of the scanner, the small talk. Then my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the church council. There\u2019d been a fire in a community member\u2019s home. They needed me to organize support, offer prayers, and be present for those in shock. My heart clenched. As a pastor, I was expected to drop everything and be there, to comfort and guide. But here I was, tied to the register, with a line of customers waiting for my attention. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, the urge to serve my congregation battling with my duty to my employer and the people in front of me. My hands trembled as I handed back change, my mind racing, torn between two worlds that needed me right now."}
