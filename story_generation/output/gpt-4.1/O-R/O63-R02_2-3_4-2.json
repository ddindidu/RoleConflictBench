My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my eyes kept drifting to the calendar. Today was the most significant religious holiday of the year, and as the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the evening prayers. The congregation would already be gathering, waiting for me to open the service. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cService begins at 5:00 PM.\u201d I felt my chest tighten. If I left now, I\u2019d let my sales team down and risk my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d disappoint my community and neglect my spiritual duty. The headset felt heavier than usual, and my clerical collar itched against my neck. I stared at the phone, torn between the demands of my livelihood and my calling, the weight of both roles pressing in on me as the minutes slipped away."}
