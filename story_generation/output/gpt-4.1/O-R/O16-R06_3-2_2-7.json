I stand over a patient whose symptoms are severe and baffling\u2014his breathing is ragged, his skin flushed, and none of the tests so far make sense. As a doctor, I\u2019m expected to diagnose quickly and accurately, to save his life. Every second counts, and my mind races through possibilities, desperate for clarity.\n\nBut as I work, I catch sight of Sarah, a friend from church, sitting in the waiting area. Her eyes are red, her posture slumped. I remember she\u2019s been struggling lately, and as a Christian, I feel the pull to comfort her, to show the love and kindness Jesus taught. I want to sit beside her, to listen and pray, to be the friend she needs right now.\n\nYet, I\u2019m torn. My patient\u2019s life hangs in the balance, demanding my full attention as a doctor. But my heart aches for Sarah, knowing she feels alone. The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I stand frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice between duty and compassion, between saving a life and tending a soul."}
