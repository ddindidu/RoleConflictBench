As the machine repairer, everyone expects me to act fast, to clean, lubricate, and replace whatever is needed before the whole line grinds to a halt. My supervisor\u2019s eyes are on me, and the pressure is suffocating. But tonight is also the community Quran study circle, and I promised myself I would be ready. I haven\u2019t read the verses yet, let alone reflected on them, and I can already imagine the gentle disappointment in my friends\u2019 faces if I show up unprepared. My toolbox feels heavier than usual, weighed down by more than just wrenches and grease. I want to be the reliable worker, the one who keeps the machines running, but I also want to be the devoted Muslim, present in both body and spirit. The screeching grows louder, echoing the turmoil inside me, as I stand frozen between the demands of my hands and the needs of my heart."}
