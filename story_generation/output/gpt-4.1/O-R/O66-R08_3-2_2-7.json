My passenger, a businessman with anxious eyes, kept checking his watch and sighing. \u201cPlease, I can\u2019t miss this flight. It\u2019s international, very important,\u201d he pleaded. I knew the airport was still miles away, and the roads were slick with ice. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get him there safely and on time, but the storm made every mile a risk.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with messages from friends already in Mecca, sharing photos and prayers. This was the year I had saved for Hajj, the pilgrimage I\u2019d dreamed of since childhood. My savings, carefully set aside, were meant for this sacred journey. But the storm meant fewer passengers, and the man in my backseat offered double the fare if I could get him to the airport quickly. The money could help with my family\u2019s needs, but it might mean postponing Hajj again.\n\nMy heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: the duty to my passenger, the promise to myself and my faith. The snow kept falling, and I was caught between two roads, unsure which one to take."}
