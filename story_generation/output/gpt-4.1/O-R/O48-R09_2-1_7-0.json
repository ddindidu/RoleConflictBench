She\u2019d just come out of surgery, and her eyes darted around the room, searching for comfort. I knew my job as a nursing assistant was to be here, to offer her reassurance and a gentle presence. She needed me to listen, to hold her hand, to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. In less than an hour, I was supposed to meet the children at the synagogue for our weekly study. Teaching them about our traditions, our history, was something I cherished\u2014a responsibility I felt deeply as a Jewish adult in our small community. I could reschedule, but I knew how much the kids looked forward to our time together, how their parents trusted me to nurture their connection to our faith. I felt torn, pulled between the anxious patient who needed my compassion and the eager children waiting to learn. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat there, wrestling with which part of myself I would have to disappoint."}
