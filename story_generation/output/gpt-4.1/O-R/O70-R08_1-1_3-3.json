As a Muslim, I always make sure to dress modestly in public, but at home, surrounded by immediate family, I can let my guard down. Just as I settled in, my phone buzzed: an urgent delivery request. The customer wasn\u2019t home, and the package needed to be left at their doorstep, with a photo as proof. I glanced at my clothes, feeling a wave of anxiety. The delivery route was just around the corner, but stepping outside dressed like this went against everything I\u2019d been taught about modesty. Yet, the company expected me to act fast, secure the package, and confirm delivery. I stood by the door, keys in hand, torn between the demands of my job and my faith, heart pounding as I weighed which expectation I would have to compromise."}
