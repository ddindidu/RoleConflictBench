As a lifeguard, I\u2019m expected to keep everything in perfect order, so when I noticed the pool\u2019s filtration system sputtering, my heart skipped. If I didn\u2019t fix it now, the water could become unsafe\u2014putting swimmers at risk. But today was also my scheduled time for spiritual study, a rare, precious hour set aside for quiet reflection and prayer. As a nun, I\u2019m expected to honor these moments, to nurture my soul and deepen my faith. I stood at the edge of the pool, torn. The tools for repair were in the maintenance closet, but my Bible and journal waited in my cell. The weight of both callings pressed on me: the urgent, practical need to protect others, and the sacred, internal need to care for my spirit. I closed my eyes, feeling the tension coil inside me, knowing I could not fulfill both expectations at once."}
