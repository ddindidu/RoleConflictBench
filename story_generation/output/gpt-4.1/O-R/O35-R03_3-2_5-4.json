Suddenly, the emergency alarm blared, jolting me from my thoughts. A passenger needed urgent help\u2014my duty as a subway operator was clear: ensure their safety, coordinate with emergency services, and keep the other passengers calm. But as I reached for the intercom, my phone buzzed in my pocket. A message from the convent: the sisters were gathering for a special healing service, praying for Sister Agnes, who had fallen gravely ill. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to offer my prayers and support, especially in moments like this. My heart twisted. The weight of my uniform felt heavier, the rosary in my pocket a silent reminder of my other calling. I stood at the crossroads of duty\u2014torn between the urgent needs of a stranger on my train and the spiritual needs of my beloved community. The train slowed, the emergency lights flashing, and I felt the pressure of both worlds pressing in, demanding an answer."}
