Pilots\u2019 voices overlapped, each waiting for my revised climb instructions. My headset felt heavier than usual, pressing against my ears as I tried to keep my voice steady and clear. The clock on the wall glowed 10:55 a.m.\u2014five minutes until the church service started. I was supposed to be there, sitting in the third pew, singing hymns and joining the congregation in prayer. My pastor had reminded me last week how important it was to be present, to show commitment not just in faith but in fellowship. But here I was, tethered to my console, responsible for the safety of dozens of lives in the sky. My heart pounded with guilt and anxiety, torn between the sacred call to worship and the urgent duty to guide these planes through the rising storm. I stared at the radar, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which voice I should answer first."}
