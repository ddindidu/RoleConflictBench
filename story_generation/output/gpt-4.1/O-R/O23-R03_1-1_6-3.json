The clock on my phone blinked 6:55 a.m.\u2014five minutes until morning prayers. Sister Agnes would expect me in the chapel, kneeling in silent devotion with the others. But here, at this networking breakfast, I was a lawyer first, expected to mingle, to build connections for the firm. A partner\u2019s friend approached, coffee in hand, and with a friendly smile asked, \u201cSo, what kind of cases are you working on these days?\u201d My mind raced. As a lawyer, I must protect my client\u2019s confidentiality, never revealing details, not even in passing. As a nun, I am called to honesty and openness, to never deceive. The chapel bell echoed faintly through the city noise, a reminder of my other world. I felt the weight of both habits\u2014the black veil and the tailored suit\u2014pressing on my shoulders. My lips parted, but I hesitated, torn between the demands of my profession and my faith, between the expectations of those around me and the silent call within."}
