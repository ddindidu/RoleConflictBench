My patient, Mrs. Goldstein, sat across from me, her eyes searching mine for reassurance as she asked about her cholesterol and what it meant for her future. I knew I needed to be present, to answer her questions with patience and clarity, to offer comfort and guidance as her doctor. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the weekly study session with my children was about to begin. I had promised them we would explore the story of Ruth tonight, weaving in lessons about kindness and resilience\u2014values I wanted them to carry as part of their Jewish identity. I could reschedule the lesson, but guilt gnawed at me. Was I letting my children down by not prioritizing our tradition? Or would I fail my patient by rushing through her concerns? The expectations of both roles pulled at me, and I sat there, torn, my heart aching with the impossibility of being fully present in both worlds at once."}
