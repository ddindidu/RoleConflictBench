The maintenance checklist is due by the end of the day, and as the lead scientist, it\u2019s my responsibility to ensure every piece of equipment is checked, every safety protocol followed. No malfunctions have been reported, but I know the importance of diligence\u2014one missed detail could mean disaster. Yet, my phone vibrates with a gentle reminder: the weekly group meditation begins in fifteen minutes. As a practicing Buddhist, I promised myself and my sangha that I would be present, mindful, and committed to our shared hour of stillness. My mind tugs in two directions\u2014toward the hum of machines and the hush of meditation cushions. I feel the weight of expectation from my colleagues, who trust me to keep the lab safe, and from my fellow practitioners, who look to me for calm presence. My chest tightens as I stand in the doorway, torn between the world of precision and the world of presence, knowing I cannot fully honor both at once."}
