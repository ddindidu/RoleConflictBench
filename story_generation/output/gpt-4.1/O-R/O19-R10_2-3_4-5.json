My duty as a pharmacist was clear: I needed to counsel him on how to take the medication safely, warn him about side effects, and ensure he understood the risks. As I began explaining, I noticed a colleague discreetly slipping extra pills into the man\u2019s bag. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I am taught to uphold dharma\u2014righteousness and truth. Witnessing this act of corruption, I felt a surge of anger and responsibility to act, to report the wrongdoing and protect others from harm. Yet, I also worried about the trust my patients place in me, the harmony of my workplace, and the consequences for my colleague. The expectations of my profession demanded I focus on the patient\u2019s immediate needs, but my faith urged me to confront the injustice I had just seen. Torn between my roles, I felt paralyzed, my mind racing with the weight of both responsibilities."}
