I glanced at the clock\u2014just thirty minutes until the midday prayer. The main production unit, the heart of the plant, had been down for half an hour. Every minute lost meant mounting pressure from management and anxious workers waiting for my diagnosis. My hands itched to grab my toolkit and dive into the tangle of wires and blinking lights.\n\nBut my other phone buzzed\u2014a gentle reminder from the mosque committee. I was the imam, expected to lead the small congregation in prayer. Another worshipper could step in, but I knew the community valued my presence, my voice, my guidance. Even if the group was small, my absence would be noticed, perhaps even questioned.\n\nI stood in the middle of the factory, torn. The weight of expectation pressed from both sides: the urgent need to restore the machine, the quiet call to spiritual duty. My mind raced, heart pounding, as I wrestled with which responsibility to honor first, knowing that whichever I chose, I would disappoint someone who counted on me."}
