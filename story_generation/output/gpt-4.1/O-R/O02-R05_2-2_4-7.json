The new safety standard would take effect tomorrow, and our product release was scheduled for the same day. As lead engineer, it was my responsibility to ensure every document was in order, every test result logged, every box checked. The team was counting on me to sign off before launch. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the Cohen family\u2019s bar mitzvah was tomorrow afternoon. I had promised their son, Daniel, that I would be there to guide him through his Torah reading, to bless him as he stepped into adulthood. Months of preparation, countless hours of study, and the family\u2019s trust rested on my presence. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my colleagues needing my technical expertise, the community needing my spiritual leadership. I sat at my desk, torn, the clock ticking down, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
