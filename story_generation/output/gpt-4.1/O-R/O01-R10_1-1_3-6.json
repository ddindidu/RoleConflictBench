As an architect, I knew every inch mattered\u2014each wall, each window, each corner had to serve a purpose. I was determined to make the space as functional as possible, even if it meant sacrificing a bit of comfort or beauty. My mind was deep in measurements and lines when the distant sound of drums and laughter drifted through my open window. I looked outside and saw the street alive with color\u2014marigold garlands, oil lamps, and neighbors gathering for the festival. As a Hindu, I was expected to join, to offer prayers, to be part of the rituals that connected me to my community and my faith. My heart tugged in two directions: the quiet focus of my work, the pressing deadline, and the pull of tradition, the warmth of shared celebration. I watched the flickering lamps, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I should honor first."}
