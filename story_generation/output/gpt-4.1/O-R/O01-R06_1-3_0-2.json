They were small\u2014barely noticeable, unlikely to cause immediate harm. The client was already behind schedule, and my supervisor had made it clear: we needed to move forward, no delays. As an architect, I was expected to ensure safety and compliance, but these issues seemed so insignificant, so easy to overlook. Yet, as a Christian, I felt the weight of my faith pressing on my conscience. I was taught to live with integrity, to be honest even when it was inconvenient. The thought of letting these errors slide gnawed at me. Was I compromising my values for the sake of expediency? My heart pounded as I imagined the consequences\u2014disappointing my team, risking my reputation, or betraying my beliefs. I stared at the plans, torn between the demands of my profession and the call of my faith, unsure which voice to follow."}
