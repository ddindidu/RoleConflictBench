My last client, Mrs. Kapoor, glared at her reflection, her voice rising above the hum of the hairdryers. \u201cThis is not what I asked for! How could you get it so wrong?\u201d she snapped, her words sharp and public. I could feel the eyes of my coworkers and the other clients on me, expecting me to stay calm, apologize, and fix the cut, no matter how late it got. But tonight was different. My family was waiting at home, the house fragrant with incense and marigolds for the puja. My mother had called twice already, reminding me to come straight home, to change into my sari and help with the preparations. The ceremony was sacred, and being late would be disrespectful. I stood there, scissors in hand, torn between the duty to my client and the promise I\u2019d made to my family and faith. My mind raced, caught between the angry woman in my chair and the image of my family gathered in prayer, waiting for me."}
