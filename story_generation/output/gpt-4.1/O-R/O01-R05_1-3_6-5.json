The project manager\u2019s email blinked on my screen: \u201cNeed updated timelines by noon.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u201411:15. I\u2019d been reviewing the project\u2019s progress, making sure the team was on track, but I hadn\u2019t yet compiled the detailed report. My phone buzzed. It was Miriam, the conversion candidate. \u201cRabbi, are we still meeting at noon? I\u2019m so nervous for the Beit Din.\u201d Her final study session, the one that could shape her entire Jewish future, was set for the same hour. As an architect, I was expected to keep projects running smoothly, to be reliable and efficient. As a rabbi, I was entrusted with guiding souls, teaching Torah, and being fully present for those in need. My mind raced, torn between the demands of my profession and my calling. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, each urgent, each important, and I sat frozen, heart pounding, unsure which path to take."}
