As a lawyer, I had just ended a tense call with opposing counsel, who hinted at knowing more than he should and pressed me for information that, if revealed, would devastate my client\u2019s case. The rules were clear\u2014confidentiality was paramount, and my client\u2019s trust was sacred. Yet, the pressure gnawed at me, knowing that a single misstep could unravel everything.\n\nMy phone buzzed again. It was a message from Ahmed, a devoted member of my congregation. He asked if I could meet him tonight, his words laced with desperation. As an imam, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and guidance, especially when someone\u2019s faith and family were at stake. But my mind was still tangled in legal knots, and I wondered if I could truly be present for him, or if my own turmoil would seep into our conversation.\n\nI felt torn, the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions. How could I honor my client\u2019s trust while also being the spiritual anchor my community needed? The conflict churned inside me, unresolved."}
