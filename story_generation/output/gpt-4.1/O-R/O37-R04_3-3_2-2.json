The manager had just reminded me that every room needed to be deep cleaned and sanitized before the end of my shift. I could already hear the echo of her voice, \u201cNo shortcuts today, everything must be spotless.\u201d I glanced at my watch, feeling the minutes slip away. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee: a large crowd had gathered for a special remembrance, and I was the only authorized imam present. The community was waiting, expecting me to lead them in prayer, to offer guidance and comfort. My heart pounded as I looked at the cleaning cart and then at the mosque\u2019s minaret visible through the window. The weight of both responsibilities pressed down on me\u2014one demanding my hands, the other my spirit. I felt torn, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
