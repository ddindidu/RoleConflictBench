The hospital project was behind schedule, and the city inspector\u2019s visit loomed. Every line I drew, every calculation I checked, carried the weight of lives\u2014patients, doctors, families\u2014who would trust this building to keep them safe. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the holiday was just days away. My children were waiting for me to teach them the blessings, the melodies, the stories that my parents once taught me. I could hear their laughter from the next room, their voices practicing words they didn\u2019t yet understand. My heart ached with guilt. The world expected me to be vigilant, precise, unyielding in my duty as an architect. My family needed me to be present, to pass on our traditions, to nurture their Jewish identity. I stared at the plans, then at the closed door to my children\u2019s room, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, unsure which demand I could afford to let slip."}
