Yet, as I hung up, the convent bell chimed, a gentle but insistent reminder. Today was the monthly food drive, and as a nun, I was expected to be present, to serve, to embody compassion for the homeless who would soon line up at our gates.

I stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, caught between duty and devotion, unable to silence the ache of letting someone down, no matter which path I chose."}
