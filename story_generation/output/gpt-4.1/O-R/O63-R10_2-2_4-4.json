My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need those numbers, no excuses.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my thoughts kept drifting to the message I\u2019d just received. My friend Priya, who worked in the same office, was being blamed for a mistake she didn\u2019t make. I knew the truth, and as a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma\u2014for what is right. But if I left my desk now to speak up for her, I\u2019d lose precious time, and my sales would suffer. The pressure to perform, to keep my job, pressed against the quiet voice inside urging me to act with integrity. My headset felt heavier than usual, my heart pounding as I stared at the phone, torn between the demands of my job and the values I hold dear."}
