I glance at the spreadsheet: I\u2019m still three sales short. The pressure is suffocating; if I don\u2019t close these calls, the whole team loses out on bonuses, and I\u2019ll have to answer for it. My headset feels heavier than usual as I dial the next number, rehearsing my pitch, trying to sound upbeat when all I feel is dread.\n\nBut my phone vibrates again, this time with a calendar alert: the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series at church starts in ten minutes. As a priest, I\u2019m expected to guide and inspire, to be present for my parishioners, especially when shaping the spiritual journey of the community. I know the volunteers are counting on me to lead, to listen, to set the tone for the months ahead.\n\nI stare at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the relentless demands of my sales quota and the quiet, sacred responsibility of my calling. My heart pounds as I weigh which role to step into, feeling the expectations of both worlds pressing in on me."}
