Can I return it?\u201d she pleaded. Store policy was clear\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. My manager expected me to enforce the rules, no exceptions. I could see her frustration, and I felt a pang of sympathy. As an imam, I was taught to show compassion, to help those in need, to be a source of comfort. My mind wandered to the mosque, where I was scheduled to lead the afternoon prayer in just half an hour. Today, the congregation would be small, and another brother was present who could easily step in. But the community looked to me for guidance, for consistency. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the cashier who must uphold policy, the imam who must embody mercy. My heart raced as I tried to decide what to do, torn between the rules of my job and the values of my faith."}
