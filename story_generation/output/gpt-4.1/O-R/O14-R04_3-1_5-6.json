The journal\u2019s submission portal blinked a warning: deadline in twelve hours. As a scientist, I knew the importance of accuracy\u2014every figure, every word, had to be precise. My reputation, my team\u2019s work, and the integrity of our findings depended on it. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from Ahmed, a gentle reminder that he hoped to talk soon. He\u2019d mentioned after Friday prayers that he was struggling, and as the imam, I was expected to offer guidance, to listen, to be present for him. The weight of both roles pressed on me. If I focused on the report, I\u2019d neglect someone in need. If I called Ahmed, I risked missing the deadline and letting my colleagues down. My mind raced, torn between the demands of truth and compassion, science and faith, as the minutes slipped away."}
