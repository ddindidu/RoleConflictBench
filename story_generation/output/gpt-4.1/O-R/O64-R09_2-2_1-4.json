My manager expects me to keep the line moving, no mistakes, no delays. My stomach growls\u2014it's been hours since breakfast, and I know I won\u2019t get another break for a while. I glance at the clock, calculating how much time I\u2019ll have to grab lunch before my next shift starts. There\u2019s only one food vendor nearby, a tiny stand I know is kosher-certified, but it\u2019s always packed at this hour. If I wait for kosher food, I\u2019ll be late returning, and my manager will be furious. If I grab something quick from the convenience store, I\u2019ll break my commitment to keeping kosher. My hands tremble as I hand a customer their change, my mind torn between my responsibility to my job and my faith. The pressure builds in my chest as I try to focus on the next transaction, knowing I\u2019ll have to choose soon."}
