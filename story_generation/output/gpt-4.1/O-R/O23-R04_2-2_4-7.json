My client\u2019s case was hanging by a thread, and I knew how much depended on my preparation and presence. Every detail mattered; I owed them my sharpest advocacy. Just as I was reviewing my notes, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Brother Yusuf, a long-time congregant. He sounded desperate, asking if I could meet him soon. His family was in crisis, and he needed my guidance as his imam, someone to listen and help him find peace. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My client\u2019s future, my congregant\u2019s pain\u2014both urgent, both deserving. I could not be in two places at once, and the expectations from each role clashed inside me. My mind raced, heart heavy, as I tried to figure out how to honor my responsibilities without failing someone who trusted me."}
