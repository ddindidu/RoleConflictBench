As a carpenter, I knew the importance of inspecting my tools before any structural work. Safety protocols weren\u2019t just rules\u2014they were a responsibility. I laid out my equipment, checking each blade and handle for wear, knowing that a single oversight could lead to disaster. Just as I was about to start, my phone buzzed. It was Tenzin, my friend from the temple. He wanted to meet and discuss the sermon from last night, eager to share insights and deepen our understanding together. As a Buddhist, I valued these moments of spiritual reflection, the chance to nurture wisdom and compassion. But the clock was ticking, and the crew would soon arrive, expecting everything to be ready. My mind tugged in two directions: the duty to ensure a safe workspace, and the call to spiritual study with a friend. I stood there, tools in hand, heart heavy with the weight of both worlds, uncertain which path to follow first."}
