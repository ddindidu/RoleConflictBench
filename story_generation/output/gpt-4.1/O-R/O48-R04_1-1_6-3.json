She had been especially quiet today, her eyes searching mine for comfort as she spoke of her late husband and the loneliness that crept in during the afternoons. As a nursing assistant, I knew my presence mattered\u2014sometimes more than the medication or the meals. My heart ached to stay, to listen, to offer the companionship she so clearly needed.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: Friday prayers were approaching. As the imam, the congregation expected me to deliver the Khutbah, to guide them with words of faith and hope. The guest speaker was ready, but I knew many in the community looked forward to my sermons, especially during these uncertain times. I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing on me.\n\nI sat there, torn between the quiet need of one soul and the collective anticipation of many. My mind raced, wrestling with the guilt of leaving Mrs. Rahman alone and the responsibility I felt toward my congregation. The minutes ticked by, and I still hadn\u2019t decided which role I would fulfill."}
