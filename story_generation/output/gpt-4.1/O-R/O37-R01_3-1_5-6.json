She\u2019d made it clear\u2014no substitutes, no exceptions. I could already hear her disappointment if I failed to deliver. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the community gathering at the church was starting soon, and I was expected to share a story about honesty and integrity. As a pastor, I knew my congregation looked to me for guidance, for living out the very principles I preached. But right now, I was torn. Should I leave to buy the polish, risking being late to the gathering and letting down my church? Or should I stay, use a different product, and compromise Mrs. Lee\u2019s trust? The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding practical responsibility, the other moral leadership. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, mop in hand, caught between two worlds that both needed me, but in completely different ways."}
