As a police officer, my duty was clear: keep the scene safe, ensure no one else got hurt, and gather statements. My radio crackled with updates, but my focus was broken when I recognized Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation, sitting on the curb, her face streaked with tears. She wasn\u2019t involved in the accident, but she looked shaken, clutching her Bible to her chest. I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her pastor, I felt the pull to kneel beside her, offer comfort, and pray. But the chaos around me demanded my attention as an officer\u2014civilians needed direction, paramedics needed space, and the accident report wouldn\u2019t write itself. I stood frozen for a moment, torn between the badge on my chest and the collar at my neck, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which duty to answer first."}
