As an accountant, I knew what was expected: respond quickly, ensure every number matched, and protect the company from penalties. But as I reviewed the files, my manager leaned in and whispered, \u201cJust adjust the figures a bit. It\u2019s what everyone does. We can fix it next quarter.\u201d My heart pounded. The law was clear\u2014no room for creative math. But the pressure was real, and my job felt suddenly fragile. As a Christian, honesty and integrity weren\u2019t just ideals; they were commands I tried to live by, even in small things. Now, the expectation to bend the truth for the company\u2019s sake clashed with my faith\u2019s call to righteousness. My hands trembled over the keyboard, torn between the demands of my profession and the convictions of my soul."}
