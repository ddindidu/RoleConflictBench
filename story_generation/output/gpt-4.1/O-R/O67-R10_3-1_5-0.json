As an ambulance driver, I was trained to act fast, to provide care before we even reached the hospital. The paramedic called out for help, and I knew I\u2019d have to leave the driver\u2019s seat, to press my hands to the patient\u2019s chest, to count compressions, to fight for his life.\n\nBut as a Hindu, this was the hour I always paused, even for a moment, to recite my mantra. It was my anchor, a daily ritual that kept me grounded, a promise to my faith and to myself. Today, I\u2019d only managed a hurried whisper of the words, not the full ritual, and guilt gnawed at me. The expectation to serve, to save, clashed with the quiet pull of my spiritual duty. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles, torn between the urgent call of a dying man and the silent call of my faith. I hesitated, caught in the space between duty and devotion, unsure which demand to answer first."}
