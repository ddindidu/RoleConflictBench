She stared into the mirror, her lips pressed tight, eyes flickering with disappointment at the colour. My heart sank. As a hairdresser, I knew I had to address her concerns, listen patiently, and do whatever I could to make her happy. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the Friday prayer was less than an hour away. Today was special; the community had gathered from distant towns, waiting to hear my sermon marking our milestone. I could picture the mosque filling up, the anticipation in their faces, the trust they placed in me as their imam. Yet here I was, torn between the woman in my chair, whose trust I also held, and the congregation waiting for guidance. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me. I wanted to be present for both, to meet every expectation, but the minutes ticked by, and I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
