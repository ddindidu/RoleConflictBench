As a judge, I know I must stay current, for every decision I make could set a precedent, and ignorance is no excuse. Yet, as I reach for the journal, my phone buzzes with a message from the mayor: the hurricane has left devastation in its wake, and the community needs me\u2014not as a judge, but as Sister Maria, the nun who leads relief efforts with compassion and resolve. The convent is already bustling with volunteers, and I am expected to guide them, to comfort the displaced, to embody the charity my vows demand. My mind tugs in two directions: the duty to the law, to intellectual rigor and justice, and the duty to serve, to be present in the suffering of others. I feel the weight of both robes\u2014the black of the bench and the habit of my order\u2014pressing on my shoulders, each demanding my full devotion, each unwilling to wait."}
