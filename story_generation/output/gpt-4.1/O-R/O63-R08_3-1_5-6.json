I needed that bonus\u2014not just for rent or bills, but because I was saving every extra penny for Hajj. It was my dream, my duty as a Muslim, to make the pilgrimage, but the cost was daunting, especially this early in my career.\n\nI dialed the next number, rehearsing the script, but my mind wandered. The company expected me to push hard, to close every sale, even if it meant glossing over details or nudging hesitant customers. But my faith taught me honesty and integrity, especially when money was involved. I felt torn\u2014if I didn\u2019t meet my target, I\u2019d let my team down and delay my Hajj even further. If I pushed too hard, I\u2019d betray the values I was saving for. My thumb hovered over the call button, my chest tight with the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
