My mother\u2019s surgery is tonight.\u201d The station was clear across town, and traffic was thickening. As a taxi driver, I felt the weight of her urgency, the unspoken expectation to get her there safely and swiftly. But my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes: \u201cThe healing service for Sister Maria starts at 7. We need you with us in prayer.\u201d As a nun, my presence was expected, especially tonight, when faith and community meant everything. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. The city\u2019s noise faded as my mind raced between the desperate hope in my passenger\u2019s eyes and the quiet sanctuary awaiting me. I could not be in two places at once. The car idled at a red light, and I stared at the cross hanging from my rearview mirror, heart pounding, torn between duty to a stranger and devotion to my sisters."}
