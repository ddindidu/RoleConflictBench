As a carpenter, I\u2019m expected to be on site by seven sharp, boots laced, tools ready, and\u2014most importantly\u2014focused on safety. The foreman has warned us: one slip, one shortcut, and someone could get hurt. But as I packed my lunch, my phone buzzed with a message from Miriam, the conversion candidate. Her final study session before the Beit Din is this morning\u2014the only time she can meet before her decisive appearance. As her rabbi, I know how much she\u2019s poured into this journey, and how much she needs my guidance now. My heart pounds as I picture the children and adults who rely on me for Torah, and the anxious look Miriam will have if I don\u2019t show. But I also see my crew, waiting for me, counting on me to set the tone for a safe, productive day. I stand in the kitchen, keys in hand, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
