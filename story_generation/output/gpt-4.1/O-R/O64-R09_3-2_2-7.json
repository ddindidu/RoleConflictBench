I glanced at the line of customers, each with carts piled high, and felt the weight of the cash drawer beneath my hands. Tonight, I was scheduled to chant Torah at synagogue, something I\u2019d practiced for weeks. The service started at 6:30, and I needed to be there early to prepare. But as the end-of-day rush hit, my manager asked me to stay and help process a series of high-value transactions. The expectation was clear: accuracy was everything, especially with large sums. Any mistake could mean hours of reconciliation and a stern talk from my boss. Yet, my community expected me at the bimah, ready to chant, fulfilling a commitment I\u2019d made not just to them, but to my faith. My heart pounded as I rang up another customer, torn between the responsibility in my hands and the promise I\u2019d made to my congregation. The minutes ticked by, and I felt the pressure mounting, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
