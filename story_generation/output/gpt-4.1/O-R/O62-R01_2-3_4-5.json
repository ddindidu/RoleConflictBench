Swim lessons were scheduled in less than an hour, and if I didn\u2019t fix it, the kids would be at risk, and the lessons would be thrown into chaos. As the lifeguard, it was my responsibility to keep everything safe and running smoothly. I knelt by the pool, already planning how to repair it, when my phone buzzed urgently. It was a message from the church council\u2014there\u2019d been a sudden fire in a member\u2019s home, and the family needed immediate support. As their pastor, I was expected to be there, to comfort, to organize help, to be the steady presence in their crisis. My heart pounded as I stared at the broken rope and the blinking phone. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent, and both were about keeping people safe in different ways. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing in from both sides, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
