My phone buzzed with a reminder: Shabbat service in one hour. As a delivery person, I knew the hospital was counting on me\u2014these supplies were urgent, and any delay could affect patient care. But as a rabbi, my congregation expected me to be present, calm, and prepared, ready to offer words of comfort and wisdom. My mind raced with the sermon I\u2019d barely had time to finish, the faces of my congregants waiting for me, the sacredness of Shabbat. Yet here I was, stuck in a maze of hospital corridors, the minutes slipping away. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014one a branded polo, the other a prayer shawl\u2014pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which duty to honor first, knowing that either choice would mean letting someone down."}
