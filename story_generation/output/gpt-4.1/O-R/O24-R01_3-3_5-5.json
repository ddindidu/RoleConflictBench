As a judge, I was expected to draft a clear, detailed order for the defendant\u2019s release\u2014every minute mattered, and the defendant\u2019s fate hung on my words. Yet, my phone buzzed with urgent messages from my congregation. A fire had swept through a family\u2019s home, and as their pastor, I was needed\u2014right now\u2014to comfort them, to organize shelter and prayer, to be the steady hand in their storm. I stared at the blank order on my desk, feeling the weight of the law and the ache of my calling. Both roles demanded my full presence, my compassion, my clarity. I could not be in two places at once, and the expectations pressed in, each as vital as the other. My heart pounded as I wrestled with which duty to answer first, knowing that someone would be left waiting for the care they desperately needed."}
