My script only skimmed the surface, and I could hear the skepticism in their voice. My supervisor expected me to handle objections smoothly, to keep the call moving, to close the sale. I felt the pressure to perform, to be persuasive, to not let the conversation slip away. Yet, my mind kept drifting to the text from my Buddhist friend, inviting me to discuss the sermon we\u2019d heard last night about mindfulness and right speech. I was supposed to be present, to reflect, to engage in honest, thoughtful conversation about the Dharma. But here I was, reciting half-truths, dodging questions, my words feeling hollow. The phone rang again. My friend\u2019s message blinked on my screen. I felt torn, my heart pulled between the demands of my job and the call to spiritual integrity. I stared at the blinking cursor, caught between answering the next call and responding to my friend, unsure which voice to honor."}
