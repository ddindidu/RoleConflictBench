The contractor was clear: everything had to be ready by tomorrow, and the electrician was waiting for me to finish so he could start his work. My phone buzzed with another message\u2014\u201cAre you done yet?\u201d\u2014and I felt the pressure mounting. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized it was nearly sunset. Every evening, I set aside time to light the lamp and offer prayers at my home altar, a ritual that grounds me and connects me to my faith. My mother always said, \u201cNo matter how busy, never miss your prayers.\u201d Yet, the unfinished cabinets stared back at me, and the voices of my coworkers echoed in my mind, urging me to keep going. My hands trembled as I weighed the expectations: the pride of delivering perfect work on time, and the peace that comes from honoring my daily rituals. I stood there, torn, the scent of sawdust mixing with the memory of incense, unsure which path to take."}
