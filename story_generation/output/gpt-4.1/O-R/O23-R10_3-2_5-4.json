Tomorrow, I was to represent my client in a high-stakes jury trial\u2014months of preparation, and the court had made it clear: no delays, no excuses. My client\u2019s future, and my reputation, hung in the balance. Yet, as I reviewed my notes, my phone buzzed with a message from Priya, a close friend. She was being unfairly targeted at work, her dignity trampled by those in power. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to speak out against injustice, especially when it affected someone I cared about. My heart ached with the urge to help her, to be present and support her through this ordeal. But the trial demanded my undivided attention; my client expected nothing less. The expectations of my profession and my faith pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt the tension coil inside me, unsure which duty I could bear to set aside."}
