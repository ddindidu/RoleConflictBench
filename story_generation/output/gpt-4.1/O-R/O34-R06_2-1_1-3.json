Holiday travel always brought this chaos, and as an air traffic controller, I was expected to keep the airspace safe and efficient, no matter how crowded the skies became. My headset buzzed with pilots\u2019 voices, each requesting updates, clearances, and reassurance.

Sunday worship was starting, and I could almost hear the hymns, feel the warmth of the congregation. As a Christian, I was expected to be there, to worship, to serve, to be present in the community.
