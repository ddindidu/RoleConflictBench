My job was to keep these machines running smoothly, but lately, I\u2019d spent more time explaining the basics than actually repairing anything. The supervisor expected me to guide the staff, to make sure they understood how to avoid costly mistakes. Yet, every time I tried to correct the operator, he brushed me off, and the waste bin filled with ruined material. My stomach rumbled\u2014a sharp reminder that I hadn\u2019t eaten since dawn. I glanced at my watch. Lunch break was coming, and I\u2019d already scouted the area: only one small vendor nearby, the only one with a kosher certificate in sight. If I left now, I could grab a meal before the line grew. But the operator was about to start another run, and if I didn\u2019t intervene, more material would be wasted. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my responsibility to the company, my commitment to my faith, both demanding my attention at the same moment. I hesitated, torn between stepping in to help and stepping out to eat."}
