She explained how much the toy meant to her son and asked for a repair quote. I could see the hope in her face, the expectation that I would restore this small piece of happiness. As I examined the damage, Sister Maria burst in, breathless. \u201cThe Johnsons\u2019 house caught fire last night. They need help\u2014food, clothing, anything we can give. Mother Superior wants us at the convent now.\u201d My heart twisted. As a carpenter, I was expected to focus on my craft, to serve customers like Mrs. Evans with skill and care. As a nun, I was called to drop everything for those in crisis, to embody compassion and selflessness. Both roles demanded my presence, my hands, my heart. I stood there, torn, the weight of two worlds pressing in, unsure which need to answer first."}
