They waved me over, asking if I could help load their bags and if they could split the fare. I nodded, already calculating the extra time this would take. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to be helpful, professional, and patient\u2014especially with tourists. But my mind kept drifting to home, where my children waited. The Jewish holiday was just days away, and I hadn\u2019t yet taught them the blessings or explained the meaning behind our traditions. My wife had reminded me that morning: \u201cThey need to know, or they\u2019ll miss the heart of the holiday.\u201d I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my duty to my passengers, and my responsibility to my children\u2019s heritage. As I reached for the first suitcase, I wondered how I could possibly meet both expectations, feeling the tension knotting in my chest."}
