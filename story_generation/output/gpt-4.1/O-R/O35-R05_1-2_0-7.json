The hum of the subway is familiar, grounding, but my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a reminder of the bar mitzvah I\u2019m meant to officiate in less than an hour. Months of preparation, a family\u2019s anticipation, a young boy\u2019s rite of passage. My congregation expects me to be present, guiding, a source of wisdom and calm. Yet here, the transit authority expects precision and reliability; the train must be checked, every detail accounted for, before departure. If I rush, I risk missing something important for the safety of hundreds. If I leave, I let down a family and a community. My hands tremble slightly as I weigh the responsibility of each role, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, both demanding my full presence, both unwilling to wait."}
