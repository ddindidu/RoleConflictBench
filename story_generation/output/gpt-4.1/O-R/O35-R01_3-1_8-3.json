The supervisor\u2019s presence behind me was a silent weight, clipboard in hand, watching every move. I knew the rules: no distractions, no deviations, every protocol followed to the letter. My heart pounded, not just from the pressure of the audit, but from the message I\u2019d just seen flash across my phone\u2014a member of my congregation, struggling, reaching out for comfort. As a pastor, I was expected to be present, to offer words of hope, even if just a quick message. But as a subway operator, I was expected to be flawless, undistracted, a model of focus. My phone buzzed again in my pocket, the supervisor\u2019s eyes flicked to my hands, and I felt the two worlds pulling me apart. I gripped the controls tighter, torn between the silent plea for help and the unyielding demand for perfection."}
