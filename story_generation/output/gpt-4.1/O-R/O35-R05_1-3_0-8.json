The hum of the subway is familiar, grounding. My radio crackles with updates about the morning rush, and I know the expectation: keep the train running safely and on time. But my phone vibrates in my pocket, and when I check it, my heart sinks. A message from the synagogue president: \u201cMiriam\u2019s father passed. The family needs you for the funeral\u2014soon.\u201d As their rabbi, I am expected to be present, to guide them through grief, to honor the deceased without delay. I glance at the clock. If I leave now, the train\u2019s checks will be incomplete, risking delays and disappointing commuters. If I stay, I fail a grieving family in their hour of need. The weight of both uniforms\u2014my operator\u2019s vest and my rabbinic tallit\u2014presses on my shoulders. I close my eyes, feeling the pull of duty from two worlds, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
