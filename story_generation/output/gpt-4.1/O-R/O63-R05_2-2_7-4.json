My break was scheduled for 3:00 p.m., but the phone queue was overflowing, and management had sent another reminder: \u201cNo unscheduled breaks. All hands on deck.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20142:55 p.m. In five minutes, I was supposed to be in the synagogue classroom, teaching Torah to the children, a commitment I\u2019d made months ago. Their parents trusted me to guide them, to be present, to answer their questions about faith and tradition. But here, in this cubicle, I was just another voice on the line, expected to follow the rules, to keep the calls moving, to not let the team down. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: the children waiting for their rabbi, the supervisor watching my break log, the sense of duty pulling me in two directions. I felt the pressure building, the impossible choice looming, as the clock ticked closer to three."}
