As an architect, I was expected to design a floor plan that maximized efficiency\u2014every inch of space needed to serve a purpose, every desk positioned for productivity. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need this to be perfect for the team.\u201d I sketched and erased, determined to meet every demand.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a colleague who\u2019d been unusually quiet lately. She was struggling, her words heavy with sadness. As a Christian, I felt a deep pull to reach out, to offer comfort and kindness, to be present for her as Jesus would have been. Yet, the deadline loomed, and I knew that stepping away now would mean falling behind, letting down my team.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at the plans, torn between the expectations of my profession and the call to show compassion. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I found myself wrestling with which demand to answer first."}
