The crew would be waiting for me at the site, expecting me to lead by example\u2014always on time, always careful, always making sure everyone followed the safety protocols. One slip, one shortcut, and someone could get hurt. But as I reached for my tool belt, my phone buzzed. It was Sarah, her voice trembling, asking if I could meet her at the church. She was in crisis, desperate for guidance, her words tumbling out about choices she couldn\u2019t face alone. As her pastor, I knew how much she needed me right now, how much she trusted me to help her find her way. I stared at the door, torn. If I left for the site, I\u2019d be letting Sarah down when she needed me most. If I stayed, the crew would be left waiting, and the risk of an accident would rise without my oversight. My heart pounded as I stood between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
