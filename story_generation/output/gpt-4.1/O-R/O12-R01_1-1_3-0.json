The product team had made the session optional, but I knew my input was valued\u2014last time, my ideas shaped a key feature. Skipping it might mean missing a chance to influence the project\u2019s direction, and I didn\u2019t want to let my team down. But Mrs. Evans had sounded so fragile on Sunday, her voice trembling as she asked if I had time to talk. As her pastor, I felt a deep responsibility to be there, to offer comfort and guidance when she needed it most. My mind raced with questions: Would the team notice if I wasn\u2019t at the session? Would Mrs. Evans feel abandoned if I postponed our call? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my best. I sat at my desk, torn, wishing I could split myself in two."}
