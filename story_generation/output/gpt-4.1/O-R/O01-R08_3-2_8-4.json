My phone buzzes with messages from team leads\u2014another delay, another conflict to resolve. As the architect in charge, everyone expects me to keep things moving smoothly, to be present, decisive, and approachable. Today, though, there\u2019s an added layer: the office function this afternoon, a rare gathering with colleagues from every department, men and women alike. The invitation specifies \u201cbusiness casual,\u201d and I know from past events that most women wear fitted dresses or skirts. \n\nAs a Muslim, I\u2019m committed to dressing modestly\u2014long sleeves, loose clothing, nothing revealing. I can already imagine the curious glances, the subtle questions, maybe even the feeling of being out of place. But if I don\u2019t attend, or if I stand out too much, will my team see me as distant or unapproachable? Will my absence or difference undermine my authority, especially when the project is at such a critical stage? My mind races, torn between the expectations of my faith and the demands of my profession, the weight of both roles pressing in as the afternoon approaches."}
