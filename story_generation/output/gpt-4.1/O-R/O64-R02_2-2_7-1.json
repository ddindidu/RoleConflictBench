My manager expected me to keep things moving, to be friendly and efficient, and I could see the impatience in the faces of those waiting. I tried to focus on each person, making small talk, remembering that a kind word could brighten someone\u2019s day. But as I handed a receipt to a customer, I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes until the main weekly service at the church, the one I was supposed to lead. My congregation counted on me to be there, to guide them in prayer and offer comfort. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing on me, knowing how much they valued my presence. My heart pounded as I looked at the growing line, torn between my duty to these customers and my responsibility to my community of faith. The minutes ticked by, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
