I\u2019ve been with your company for years!\u201d My script told me to reassure, to explain every detail, to win him back. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t lose a customer. Answer every question.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014almost lunchtime. My stomach rumbled, but I knew the only kosher place nearby was the tiny vendor across the street, and they\u2019d close soon for the afternoon. If I missed it, I\u2019d have nothing to eat until evening, and I couldn\u2019t break kosher, not even for convenience. But Mr. Feldman wasn\u2019t letting up, and I couldn\u2019t rush him off the call. My headset felt heavier as I tried to focus on his concerns, my mind split between my duty to my job and my commitment to my faith. The pressure built inside me, a tug-of-war between the expectations of my boss and the demands of my tradition, and I felt myself caught, unable to move in either direction."}
