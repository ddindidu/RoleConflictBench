My client\u2019s future depended on my preparation; the stakes were high, and the court would not grant a delay. Yet, as I reviewed my notes, Sister Maria burst into my office, her face pale. \u201cThe Johnsons\u2019 house burned down last night. They have nothing. We\u2019re gathering food and clothes for them now. Can you help?\u201d\n\nMy heart twisted. As a nun, I was expected to serve those in need, to be present in moments of crisis. The Johnsons were our neighbors, and the community looked to me for leadership and compassion. But as a lawyer, I was bound by duty to my client, who trusted me to fight for them in court. Both roles demanded my full presence, my time, my heart. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down. I closed my eyes, the voices of duty and compassion warring within me, and tried to steady my breath, knowing a decision had to be made."}
