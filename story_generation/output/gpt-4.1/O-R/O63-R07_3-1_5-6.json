My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my heart wasn\u2019t in it. My phone buzzed with a message from Tenzin, my friend from the temple: \u201cCan we talk? I want to reflect on the sermon about right livelihood.\u201d I stared at the message, guilt prickling at my chest. The teachings about mindfulness and compassion, about not causing harm, clashed with the pressure to close deals, sometimes to people who didn\u2019t really need what I was selling. I wanted to be present for Tenzin, to discuss the path to inner peace, but the sales target loomed over me like a storm cloud. My mind raced between the ringing phone and the quiet wisdom of the Dharma, torn between the demands of my job and the call to live with integrity. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to answer first."}
