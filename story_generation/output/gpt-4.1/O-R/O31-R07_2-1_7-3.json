As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, to listen carefully and judge impartially. But my watch buzzed\u2014a gentle reminder that my ten-minute window for mindfulness and meditation was about to begin. I had promised myself, as a practicing Buddhist, to honor this daily ritual, to cultivate calm and compassion no matter what. Yet here I was, caught in the middle of a heated dispute, my presence needed, my judgment required. The drivers\u2019 frustration pressed in on me, their expectations clear: resolve this, be just, be decisive. But my own heart tugged in another direction, urging me to step back, breathe, and find stillness. I felt the tension coil inside me, the demands of duty and devotion pulling me apart. I glanced at the drivers, then at my watch, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down, uncertain which path to follow."}
