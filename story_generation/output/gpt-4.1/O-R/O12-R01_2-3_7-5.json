The QA team had flagged a critical bug\u2014users were getting kicked out of the system at random, and the reports were piling up. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need a fix ASAP. Users are frustrated.\u201d I started scanning logs, my mind racing through possible causes, when another notification popped up\u2014this time from the church group chat. There\u2019d been a fire in one of our community members\u2019 homes. People were scared, some displaced, and they needed immediate support. \u201cPastor, can you come? We need you,\u201d someone wrote. I stared at the two screens, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My team expected me to be the problem-solver, the one who kept things running. My congregation needed me to be present, to offer comfort and hope. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the desperate needs of my community."}
