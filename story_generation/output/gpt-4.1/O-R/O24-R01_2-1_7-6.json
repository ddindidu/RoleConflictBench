The law demanded precision, and I prided myself on staying current, never letting a precedent slip by unnoticed. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the community gathering at the church tonight. As pastor, I was expected to share a meaningful lesson, to guide my congregation with wisdom and faith. They looked to me for spiritual nourishment, and I had promised to tell the story of the Good Samaritan, weaving its message into our lives.\n\nMy laptop screen glowed with legal documents, while my Bible sat open beside it.
