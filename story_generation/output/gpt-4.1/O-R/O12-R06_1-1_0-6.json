The module worked, but it was messy\u2014full of quick fixes and shortcuts. My team lead had said the deadline was generous, so I could always come back and refactor later. Still, I felt the familiar tug of pride in my work, the expectation to write code that was clean and maintainable, something I could stand behind.\n\nJust then, my coworker Sarah stopped by, looking flustered. She asked if I could help her debug a tricky issue. I knew she\u2019d been struggling all morning. As a Christian, I try to show kindness in small ways\u2014offering help, listening, being patient. But if I helped her now, I\u2019d lose my focus and momentum, and the code would stay messy for even longer. If I turned her away, I\u2019d feel like I was failing to live out my faith.\n\nI felt the tension rising inside me, torn between my commitment to excellence in my work and my desire to be there for someone in need. My hands hovered over the keyboard, caught between two worlds, unsure which to choose."}
