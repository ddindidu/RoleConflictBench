The rules were clear\u2014no unsupervised swimming. I was supposed to enforce them, no exceptions. But then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw my friend Ravi at the snack bar, his face flushed with embarrassment as another staff member scolded him loudly for a mistake he didn\u2019t make. My heart twisted. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act with compassion and fairness. I felt a deep urge to go to Ravi, to speak up for him, to make sure he wasn\u2019t humiliated for something he didn\u2019t do. But my duty as a lifeguard pulled me back\u2014if I left my post, even for a moment, I\u2019d be breaking the trust placed in me to keep everyone safe. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my immediate attention, and I felt torn, unable to ignore either call."}
