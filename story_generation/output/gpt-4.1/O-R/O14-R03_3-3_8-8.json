I rushed to the lab, heart pounding, knowing that a leak could endanger not just my research, but everyone in the building. My mind raced through safety protocols, the steps drilled into me as a scientist: isolate the area, alert maintenance, check the seals. But as I reached for the emergency manual, my phone buzzed with a message from the convent. The Mother Superior\u2019s gentle words appeared on the screen, reminding me of the retreat and my role in leading the sisters in daily reflection. She trusted me to guide their spiritual journey, to be present, calm, and centered. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding immediate action, the other requiring my presence and peace. My hands trembled, torn between the cold logic of containment and the warm call of faith. I stood in the sterile lab, the hum of machines and the echo of prayers swirling around me, caught in the impossible space between duty and devotion."}
