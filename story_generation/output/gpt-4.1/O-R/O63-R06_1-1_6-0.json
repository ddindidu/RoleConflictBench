The call volume was unusually light today, and my supervisor had just sent a message: \u201cFeel free to take your break early if you want.\u201d I hovered my finger over the \u201cbreak\u201d button, tempted by the idea of a few extra minutes to myself. But then, a pang of guilt tugged at me. As a Christian, I\u2019d always been taught to be honest and diligent, to do what\u2019s right even when no one\u2019s watching. Was it really honest to take a longer break just because I could get away with it? My coworkers were already chatting in the break room, laughing about how easy today was. The expectation at work was clear\u2014flexibility was allowed, even encouraged. But my faith whispered a different standard: integrity, even in small things. I felt the tension coil in my chest, torn between the relaxed rules of my workplace and the higher bar I set for myself. My hand hovered, uncertain, as I wrestled with what to do next."}
