As her doctor, I knew I needed to explain her new diagnosis\u2014diabetes\u2014with patience and clarity, answering every question, offering reassurance, and making sure she left my office feeling supported. She looked at me, eyes wide, searching for hope and guidance. My pager buzzed, reminding me that I had blocked off this hour to begin preparing my next Shabbat sermon. As the rabbi, my congregation expected thoughtful, inspiring messages, and I was already behind on brainstorming topics. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: the immediate need to be present for Mrs. Goldstein, and the looming responsibility to my community. My mind raced with possible sermon themes, but guilt gnawed at me for even thinking about it while she sat before me, vulnerable and afraid. I wanted to give her my full attention, but the expectations of my congregation echoed in my mind. I took a deep breath, torn between the person in front of me and the many waiting for me each week, unsure which need should come first."}
