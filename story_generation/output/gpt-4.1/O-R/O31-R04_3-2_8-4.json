Friday. The court had summoned me to testify in a case I\u2019d investigated for months. As a police officer, I knew my presence was crucial\u2014justice depended on my integrity and fairness. Yet, as I glanced at my phone, messages from the mosque committee flashed across the screen, reminding me that I was the sole imam scheduled for the Friday sermon. The topic, \u201cJustice and Compassion in Our Community,\u201d had been announced for weeks. The congregation expected guidance, and I knew how much they looked forward to the khutbah. My heart pounded as I imagined the disappointment if I failed them, but I also pictured the courtroom, the faces of those seeking truth. Both roles demanded my presence, my voice, my commitment. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing on my shoulders, each expecting me to stand for what is right."}
