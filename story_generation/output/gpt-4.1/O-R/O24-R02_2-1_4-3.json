As a judge, I know the expectation: my final judgment must be thorough, precise, and delivered within thirty days. The parties are waiting, their futures hanging on my words. Every detail matters, every finding must be justified. Yet, as I begin outlining my opinion, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from a parishioner. She wonders if I might have time to talk, not urgently, but soon. As a priest, I am called to listen, to offer comfort and guidance, to be present for those who seek counsel. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. The law demands my focus and clarity; my faith demands my compassion and presence. I stare at the blinking cursor, torn between the silent plea of the case file and the gentle request of a soul in need, uncertain how to honor both without failing one."}
