As a judge, I am expected to write a clear, detailed judgment within the next thirty days, and the pressure to be thorough and precise is immense. My notes are scattered, and I know I need to focus, but my thoughts are interrupted by the reminder of the office function this afternoon. It\u2019s a formal event, and my colleagues will be there\u2014men and women, all dressed in their professional best. As a Muslim, I am committed to dressing modestly, but I worry about standing out or being judged for my attire. The expectation to blend in as a colleague clashes with my religious obligation. I feel the tension rising in my chest: the need to be respected as a fair, impartial judge, and the desire to remain true to my faith. My mind races with questions\u2014will my choice of dress affect how my colleagues see me? Will it distract from my authority? I stare at my unfinished judgment, feeling the pull of both roles, uncertain how to move forward."}
