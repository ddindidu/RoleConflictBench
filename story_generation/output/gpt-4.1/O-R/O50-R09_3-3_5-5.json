My supervisor\u2019s voice crackles over the radio, urgency in every word: \u201cWe need you now\u2014if that machine goes down, we lose the whole line.\u201d I grab my toolkit, heart pounding, but as I rush past the break room, the scent of food stops me. Today is the company\u2019s big communal lunch, and everyone is gathered around steaming trays. My stomach clenches with hunger\u2014I haven\u2019t eaten since dawn. But as I scan the dishes, I realize none are kosher, and there\u2019s no way to substitute or prepare my own meal here. My coworkers wave me over, expecting me to join, to be part of the team, to eat and laugh with them. At the same time, the machine\u2019s wail grows louder, and I know every second counts. I feel the weight of two worlds pressing in: the duty to keep the machines running, and the commitment to my faith. My hands tremble as I stand in the doorway, torn between the demands of my job and the expectations of my tradition, unsure which path to take."}
