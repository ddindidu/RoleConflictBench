My phone buzzed insistently\u2014Slack notifications piling up. The production service was lagging, and the traces pointed straight to the functions I\u2019d merged last week. My team needed me to jump in, debug, and patch the code, fast. I knew the expectation: clean, efficient code, and quick fixes in emergencies. But as I reached for my laptop, I caught my reflection in the dark screen\u2014hair uncovered, sleeves pushed up, not dressed for a video call or even a quick screen share. As a Muslim, I\u2019m careful to dress modestly, even at home, in case I need to interact with anyone outside my immediate family. The team might need me on camera, or at least ready for a call. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demand to fix my code and the equally strong pull to uphold my values. I hesitated, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
