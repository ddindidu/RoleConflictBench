My heart skipped. The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was explaining. I was expected, as a judge, to stay current, to pivot instantly, to ensure justice was served according to the latest law. The courtroom waited, eyes on me, expecting clarity and authority.\n\nBut my mind flickered to the lunch break ahead. I\u2019d packed my kosher meal, as always, careful to honor my faith\u2019s dietary laws. The courthouse pantry was stocked with kosher snacks, a small comfort in my demanding days. I was used to balancing these roles\u2014upholding the law, upholding my faith.\n\nNow, though, the pressure was different. The legal world demanded immediate adaptation, while my faith demanded daily, unwavering discipline. Both roles required vigilance, but in this moment, the weight of the law pressed harder. I felt the tension coil in my chest\u2014torn between the duty to the court and the quiet, persistent call of my beliefs. The courtroom was silent, waiting for my next words, as I wrestled with the impossible expectations placed upon me."}
