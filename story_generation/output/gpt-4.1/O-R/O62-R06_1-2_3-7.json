As a lifeguard, I knew I was expected to keep everything in order, to maintain the equipment and facilities so everyone could enjoy a safe, pleasant environment. I started to move toward the chairs, but then I caught sight of Sarah, one of the regulars, sitting alone at the edge of the pool. Her shoulders were hunched, and she looked like she was fighting back tears. As a Christian, I felt a deep pull to go to her, to offer a listening ear and a kind word, just as Jesus would have done. But the expectation to keep the pool area tidy pressed on me, too. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles heavy on my shoulders, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
