She hesitated, then quietly said, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit brighter than I expected.\u201d My heart sank. As a hairdresser, I knew I had to address her concern, reassure her, maybe even redo the color if she asked. I glanced at the clock\u2014my last appointment of the day. I had been looking forward to this evening, planning to recite and reflect on the Quran in peace, something I hadn\u2019t done in days. The salon was finally quiet, and I could almost feel the tranquility waiting for me at home. But now, I could sense the tension rising inside me, torn between my duty to my client and my longing for spiritual fulfillment. I tried to steady my voice, offering her a seat and a cup of tea, but inside, I was wrestling with the weight of both roles, unsure which expectation I would have to set aside tonight."}
