My shift is almost over, and I\u2019ve been looking forward to my ten-minute meditation, a small sanctuary I carve out each day. Just as I\u2019m about to close my till, a woman approaches, clutching a blender. She looks flustered. \u201cI need to return this,\u201d she says, voice trembling. I ask for her receipt, but she shakes her head, eyes pleading. Store policy is clear\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. My manager expects me to enforce this, no exceptions. But as a Buddhist, I strive to meet each person with compassion, to be present and gentle, especially when someone is suffering. My mind tugs in two directions: the rigid rules of my job and the soft, open space I try to cultivate within. The clock ticks closer to my meditation window, but the woman\u2019s anxious face holds me in place. I feel the tension coil in my chest, torn between the expectations of my uniform and the quiet path I walk inside."}
