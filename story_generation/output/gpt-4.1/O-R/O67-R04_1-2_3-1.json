Gauze, bandages, epinephrine\u2014each item accounted for, each expiration date scrutinized. My mind was focused, knowing that a missing or expired supply could mean the difference between life and death. Just as I finished, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque committee: the backup imam was still out of town, and the congregation was gathering for the noon prayer. They were counting on me to lead, as I had so many times before. I glanced at my watch. If I left now, I could just make it. But the ambulance needed to be ready for any emergency, and I was the only one on shift who knew the kit inside out. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my duty to the patients who might need me at any moment, and my responsibility to the community who looked to me for spiritual guidance. I stood frozen, torn between two worlds, each demanding all of me at the same time."}
