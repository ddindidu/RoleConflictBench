The clinic was busy, and my next patient, a young mother with a sore throat, waited anxiously outside. As a doctor, I knew my duty: listen, diagnose, prescribe the right antibiotics, and offer reassurance. My mind was already running through the symptoms of strep throat, the dosage, the follow-up care. But my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes\u2014there\u2019d been a fire at the Martinez home. The family had lost everything, and the convent was gathering food and clothing for them. As a nun, I was expected to be there, to offer comfort, to serve those in need without hesitation.\n\nI felt the weight of both callings pressing down on me. The patient needed my medical expertise, but the Martinez family needed my compassion and hands-on help. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock, torn between the sterile certainty of the clinic and the urgent, messy need outside its walls. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the expectations of healer and servant pulling me in opposite directions."}
