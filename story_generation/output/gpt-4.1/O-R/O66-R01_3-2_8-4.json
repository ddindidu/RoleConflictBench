She sounded desperate, and I knew the app would penalize me if I was late. I pressed the accelerator, glancing at the clock, calculating the fastest route. Just then, my phone vibrated again\u2014this time, a message from a member of my congregation. He was in tears, his words tumbling out about a family crisis, begging for a few minutes of my time and a prayer. As a pastor, I knew he needed me to listen, to offer comfort and hope. But as a taxi driver, I was expected to deliver prompt, professional service. My heart pounded as I weighed the urgency of both calls, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my full attention."}
