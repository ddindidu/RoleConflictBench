The beach was packed, high tide swelling the surf, and I knew that even a second\u2019s distraction could mean disaster. My whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder of my duty to protect every soul in the water. Yet, in my pocket, the small prayer book pressed against my thigh, a silent summons to another calling. The Mother Superior\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cSister, your guidance is needed for the retreat. The community looks to you for spiritual nourishment.\u201d I was expected to lead, to inspire, to be present in prayer and reflection. But how could I turn my gaze from the sea, even for a moment? The weight of both uniforms\u2014my red lifeguard shirt and my habit\u2014felt almost unbearable. My heart pounded with the knowledge that I could not be in two places at once, and both roles demanded all of me, right now."}
