I straighten my headset, ready to launch into the script about our new service. The prospect on the other end is polite but persistent, asking technical questions that spiral far beyond the talking points I\u2019ve memorized. My supervisor expects me to handle objections smoothly, to keep the call moving, but I feel my answers growing vague. Each minute I spend fumbling for answers, I\u2019m reminded of the community memorial service at the temple tonight. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to be present, to chant and offer support to grieving families. The ceremony is important, a time to set aside worldly concerns and be fully present. But the calls keep coming, and my shift won\u2019t end before the service begins. My mind tugs in two directions: the duty to my job, to the numbers and the script, and the duty to my sangha, to compassion and presence. I stare at the clock, heart pounding, caught between the demands of my headset and the quiet call of the temple bell."}
