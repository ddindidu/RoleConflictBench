Only an hour left in my shift, and I was still three sales short of my weekly target. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week.\u201d I stared at the list of cold leads, feeling the pressure mount. If I didn\u2019t make those calls, I\u2019d let the team down\u2014and maybe risk my job.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from the monastery. The annual festival preparations were starting at dawn, and they needed volunteers to help set up the altar and cook for the community. As a practicing Buddhist, I was expected to be there, to serve selflessly and participate in the rituals that only happened once a year. My teacher always said, \u201cTrue practice is in showing up for others.\u201d\n\nI sat frozen, torn between the relentless drive to meet my sales quota and the quiet pull of my spiritual commitment. The demands of both worlds pressed in on me, and I felt the tension knotting in my chest as I stared at the phone, unable to move."}
