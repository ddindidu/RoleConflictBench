She smiled, her hair still damp and fragrant from a recent wash. \u201cI just washed it at home,\u201d she said, settling into my chair. As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before styling, but her hair was spotless, and she looked uncomfortable at the thought of another wash. Still, the salon\u2019s policy was strict\u2014no exceptions. My manager expected consistency, and skipping a step could mean a reprimand.\n\nBut my mind was already racing ahead. In less than an hour, I was supposed to be at the church, leading the children\u2019s religious education class. The parents counted on me to be there, to guide their kids and keep the lessons on track. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the salon\u2019s rules on one side, the church\u2019s trust on the other. My hands hovered over the sink, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to let down."}
