As a lawyer, I was used to these networking events, where every conversation was a potential opportunity. Tonight, a local businessman leaned in, lowering his voice, \u201cI heard you\u2019re representing the family from the fire. What\u2019s their situation?\u201d His tone was casual, but I felt the weight of my oath\u2014client confidentiality was absolute. Yet, as a nun, my heart ached for the family, knowing they needed help, and my community expected me to lead the relief effort. The sisters were already gathering food and clothes, waiting for my guidance. I could sense the businessman\u2019s genuine concern, and I knew sharing even a little might unlock more support for the family. But the rules of my profession pressed in, cold and unyielding. My mind raced, torn between the silence demanded by my legal role and the compassion expected from my spiritual calling. I hesitated, words caught in my throat, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds."}
