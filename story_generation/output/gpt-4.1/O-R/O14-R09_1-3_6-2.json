The equipment is running smoothly, but protocol is protocol\u2014every item must be checked, every safety measure confirmed. The deadline is looming, and I know my supervisor expects nothing less than perfection. Yet, my mind drifts to my son, sitting at the kitchen table at home, struggling to recite his Torah portion for his upcoming bar mitzvah. He needs me to guide him, to help him understand the words and their meaning, to pass on the traditions that have shaped our family for generations. My colleagues expect me to be the vigilant scientist, always present, always precise. My family expects me to be the devoted teacher, the bearer of our heritage. The weight of both worlds presses on my chest, and I feel torn\u2014how can I be in two places at once, meeting the demands of both science and faith?"}
