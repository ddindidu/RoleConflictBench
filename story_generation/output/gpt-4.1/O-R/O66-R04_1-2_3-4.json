My topic, \u201cPatience in Daily Life,\u201d had been announced all week. The congregation would be waiting, expecting guidance and inspiration. But as a taxi driver, I had just picked up a passenger who needed to get across town, and he was in a hurry. \u201cPlease, can you go a bit faster? I can\u2019t be late,\u201d he pleaded, his eyes anxious in the rearview mirror.\n\nThe roads were clear, the speed limit reasonable, but I knew the temptation to push it. As a driver, I was expected to obey every traffic law, to keep my passenger and others safe. Yet, as an imam, I felt the weight of my community\u2019s trust, their anticipation for the sermon I had prepared. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, my mind torn between the duty to my passenger and the responsibility to my congregation. The minutes ticked by, each one stretching the tension inside me, as I wrestled with the impossible choice between my two roles."}
