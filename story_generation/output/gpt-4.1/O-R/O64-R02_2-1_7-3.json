My hands move quickly, scanning items, making small talk, and wishing people a good day. The line stretches back to the bakery, and I can feel the impatience simmering. Then, in the middle of the chaos, Mrs. Evans steps up. She\u2019s a familiar face from church, her eyes tired and searching. \u201cCould we talk sometime soon?\u201d she asks quietly, her voice almost lost in the beeping and chatter. I know what she means\u2014she needs more than a friendly hello; she needs guidance, comfort, maybe even hope. But behind her, a man sighs loudly, and a mother juggles a crying toddler. My manager glances over, expecting efficiency and cheer. I feel the weight of both uniforms pressing on me: the apron and the collar. I want to be present for Mrs. Evans, to offer her the time and care she deserves, but I\u2019m tethered to this register, to the demands of the moment. My heart aches as I wrestle with what to say, torn between the needs of my flock and the expectations of my job."}
