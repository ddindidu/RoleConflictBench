The store was quiet, but my mind buzzed with the weight of the deposit. Corporate rules were clear: every cent had to be counted, logged, and double-checked before I could leave. I glanced at the thick envelope, knowing it would take at least another half hour to finish. My phone vibrated in my pocket\u2014a gentle reminder from my Buddhist study group. Tonight\u2019s discussion was on a chapter I hadn\u2019t read, and I felt a pang of guilt. The group expected me to be present, to share insights and listen deeply, but the store demanded precision and compliance.
