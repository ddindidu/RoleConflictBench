The foreman had posted about an optional training session next week\u2014attendance wasn\u2019t mandatory, but everyone knew showing up meant you were serious about your job. The guys were already talking about it, making plans to go together, and I felt the unspoken pressure to join them, to prove I was committed to the team.\n\nBut tonight, my mind was elsewhere. The community study circle was meeting at the mosque, and they\u2019d be discussing verses from the Quran I hadn\u2019t yet read. As a Muslim, I was expected to recite and reflect on these verses, to come prepared and contribute thoughtfully. I could already imagine the gentle disappointment in my imam\u2019s eyes if I showed up unprepared, the sense of letting down my brothers and myself.\n\nThe weight of both expectations pressed on me. I wanted to be a good worker, respected by my team, but I also wanted to honor my faith and grow spiritually. My thoughts tangled as I tried to figure out how to meet both demands, feeling the tension build inside me as the evening approached."}
