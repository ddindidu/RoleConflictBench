The data we\u2019d collect could be crucial, and I felt the familiar thrill of discovery tugging at me. As a scientist, I knew the importance of seizing every opportunity to test our hypotheses, to push the boundaries of what we know. But as I glanced at my phone, a notification reminded me: it was the midpoint of Ramadan. I was already behind on my daily Quran reading, and the guilt pressed in. My heart ached with the desire to catch up, to immerse myself in the verses and reflect, as I\u2019d promised myself I would this year. The experiment could wait\u2014there were other slots, and missing this one wouldn\u2019t derail the project. Yet, I worried about letting my team down, about not being present when needed. The lab\u2019s hum seemed to fade as I weighed the expectations: the pursuit of knowledge in the lab, the pursuit of spiritual growth at home. I sat at my desk, torn, the Quran on one side, my lab notes on the other, unsure which path to choose."}
