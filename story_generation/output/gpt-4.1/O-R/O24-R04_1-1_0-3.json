The hearing was in two weeks, but I knew the expectation: review every detail, no matter how routine the case seemed. My mind drifted to the mosque, where Friday prayers would begin in a few hours. As imam, the congregation looked to me for guidance and inspiration. Today, though, a guest speaker was ready, his sermon prepared, his presence a rare opportunity for the community. I could let him take the pulpit, freeing my afternoon to focus on the case. But I also knew the congregation valued my words, especially on Fridays, and some would be disappointed if I stepped aside. The pressure of both roles pressed in\u2014justice demanded my diligence, faith called for my presence. I stared at the file, then at the clock, feeling the tension coil in my chest, torn between the silent expectations of the courtroom and the hopeful eyes awaiting me at the mosque."}
