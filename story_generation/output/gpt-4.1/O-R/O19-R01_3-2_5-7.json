Mrs. Lee sat across from me, her pill bottles lined up like sentinels. She needed my full attention\u2014her new prescription could dangerously interact with her heart medication. I listened, explained, and answered her anxious questions, knowing how much she relied on my expertise. Yet, in the back of my mind, the unfinished sermon for Sunday\u2019s service gnawed at me. The congregation expected guidance on forgiveness and moral choices, and I hadn\u2019t found the right words. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cSermon draft due tonight.\u201d I felt torn, the demands of my faith community pressing against the immediate needs of my patient. Could I truly serve both without failing one? My heart pounded as I tried to focus on Mrs. Lee\u2019s concerns, but the weight of my dual responsibilities pressed in, leaving me suspended between two worlds, each expecting my undivided devotion."}
