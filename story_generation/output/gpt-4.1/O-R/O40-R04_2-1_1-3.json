Boards and tools were scattered everywhere\u2014my apprentice had rushed off, leaving the place in disarray. I knew the safety protocols by heart: a clean, organized site meant fewer accidents, fewer injuries. But as I reached for the broom, my phone buzzed. It was nearly time for Friday prayers. As the imam, the congregation expected me to deliver the Khutbah, to guide them with wisdom and presence. Yet today, a guest speaker was prepared and waiting, able to step in if I couldn\u2019t make it. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles. If I left now, the workshop would remain a hazard, risking someone\u2019s safety. If I stayed to tidy up, I\u2019d miss the chance to fulfill my spiritual duty, disappointing those who looked to me for guidance. I stood frozen, torn between the sawdust and the sacred, the demands of my hands and the needs of my heart."}
