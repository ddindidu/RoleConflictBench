If I didn\u2019t resolve the overdue invoice today, our operations could grind to a halt. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that Mrs. Evans would arrive in ten minutes, seeking counsel for her ongoing family crisis. As an accountant, I was expected to call the supplier, negotiate, and find a solution before the end of business hours. But as a priest, I was supposed to offer Mrs. Evans my undivided attention, compassion, and guidance. My mind raced, torn between the numbers demanding immediate action and the soul in need of comfort. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting my full presence, each unwilling to wait. My hands trembled as I glanced between the phone and the chapel door, heart pounding, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
