She asked about the best over-the-counter pain relief for her headache. I gave her a brief, standard answer, glancing at the growing line behind her. My manager expected efficiency, and patients wanted quick service. Yet, as a pharmacist, I knew I should offer more\u2014ask about her medical history, allergies, and other symptoms. But time was tight, and I felt the pressure to move on.\n\nLater, during a quiet moment, my thoughts drifted to my faith. As a Muslim, I felt the deep, persistent call to perform Hajj. My parents reminded me of its importance, and friends who had gone spoke of the spiritual transformation. But I was early in my career, barely making enough to cover rent, let alone save for the pilgrimage. The expectation to fulfill this pillar of Islam weighed heavily on me, clashing with my professional responsibilities and financial reality. I felt torn, caught between the demands of my job and the longing to fulfill my religious duty, unsure how to honor both."}
