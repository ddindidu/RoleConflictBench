As the only lifeguard on duty, I did my usual rounds, checking the first aid kit, scanning the water, and then I saw it\u2014a broken lane rope, frayed and floating, threatening to tangle swimmers or disrupt the kids\u2019 lessons starting in less than an hour. I knew I had to fix it before the instructors arrived, but as I reached for the repair kit, my phone buzzed. A reminder: the adult Torah class I\u2019d promised to lead at the synagogue was starting soon. It was an optional session, but I knew some congregants looked forward to these moments of learning, and I\u2019d spent days preparing. My mind raced. The pool needed me to ensure safety and order, but my community expected me to be present, to teach, to guide. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014whistle around my neck, kippah in my bag\u2014pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I stood between the pool deck and the call of Torah, torn by the demands of both worlds, unsure which duty to answer first."}
