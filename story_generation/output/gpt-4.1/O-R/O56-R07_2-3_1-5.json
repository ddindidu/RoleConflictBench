A woman stands hesitantly at the entrance, clutching her purse, eyes darting around the room. I know that look\u2014nerves, uncertainty, the hope for reassurance. As a hairdresser, it\u2019s my job to greet her warmly, to make her feel at ease, to offer her a seat and a smile. But my phone vibrates in my pocket, a gentle reminder: the weekly meditation group is gathering in the back room, and I am supposed to lead them in just a few minutes. As a Buddhist, I am expected to be present, centered, and guide others in mindfulness. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward the anxious client who needs comfort, and toward the quiet room where others await my calm presence. I feel the tension coil in my chest, the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be wholly there."}
