The pool was crowded for the community event, laughter echoing off the tiles. My stomach rumbled; I hadn\u2019t eaten since morning, and the aroma from the buffet table drifted over, making my mouth water. But as a Jew, I knew I couldn\u2019t just grab a plate\u2014the food wasn\u2019t kosher, and there were no alternatives in sight. My supervisor expected me to stay alert, never leaving my post, especially now, with so many kids splashing around. Suddenly, I spotted a swimmer flailing near the middle of the pool, and my muscles tensed, ready to leap in if needed.
