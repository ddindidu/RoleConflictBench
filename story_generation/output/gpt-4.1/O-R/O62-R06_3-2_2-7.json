As a lifeguard, I knew every second counted\u2014one slip, one missed sign, and someone could be in real danger. The tide was high, the waves rough, and the chatter of families mixed with the distant call of seagulls. Suddenly, I spotted Sarah, a friend from church, sitting alone on the sand, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs. My heart twisted. As a Christian, I felt a deep urge to go to her, to offer comfort, to be the hands and feet of Jesus in her moment of need. But my training screamed at me to stay vigilant, to never take my eyes off the water. If I left my post, even for a minute, I could be putting lives at risk. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each pulling me in opposite directions. I stood frozen, torn between the call to serve and the duty to protect, my heart pounding as I wrestled with what to do next."}
