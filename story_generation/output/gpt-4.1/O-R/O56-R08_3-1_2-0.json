They were early, and the air buzzed with their anxious chatter about the wedding schedule. As a hairdresser, I knew my job was to greet them warmly, offer tea, and help them relax before the big day. I smiled, ushering them to their seats, listening to their worries, and promising everything would be perfect.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the quiet evening I had planned for myself. Tonight, I had set aside time to recite and reflect on the Quran, something I\u2019d been longing for after a busy week. As a Muslim, this was my moment to reconnect, to find peace in the verses and let the world fall away. Now, with the bridal party needing my full attention, I felt the tug of both roles\u2014one demanding my presence and warmth, the other calling me to spiritual reflection. My heart wrestled with the expectations, torn between serving others and nourishing my own faith."}
