He had to catch an international flight, and every red light, every slow-moving car, made him sigh louder. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get him there safely and on time, but the roads were slick, and I couldn\u2019t risk a reckless move. My phone buzzed with a reminder: it was time for my evening puja, the daily ritual where I light a lamp and offer prayers at my home altar. As a Hindu, this was sacred, a moment of peace and connection I rarely missed. But now, I was far from home, the storm making any detour impossible. My mind raced\u2014should I pull over and try to pray in the car, risking my passenger\u2019s anger and his missed flight? Or should I focus on the road, knowing I\u2019d be neglecting a promise to my faith? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t fully give."}
