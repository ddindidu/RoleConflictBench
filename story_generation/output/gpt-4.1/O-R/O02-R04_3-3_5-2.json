The words \u201cimmediate safety concern\u201d echoed in my mind, and I knew that if I didn\u2019t address the issue now, the plant could be shut down. My phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from the mosque committee. The special remembrance gathering had begun, and the congregation was waiting for me to lead the prayer. No one else was authorized; they were counting on me, their imam, to guide them in this important moment.\n\nMy heart pounded as I looked at the clock. The inspector was waiting for my response, expecting swift action to ensure compliance. At the same time, the mosque was filled with people, their expectations heavy in the air. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I left now, the plant might face serious consequences. If I stayed, I would let down my community in their moment of need. The demands pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
