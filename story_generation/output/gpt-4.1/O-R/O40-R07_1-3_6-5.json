She placed the toy in my hands, explaining how much it meant to her son. \u201cCan you fix it today? He\u2019s been crying for hours.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of her hope. I glanced at the clock\u2014forty minutes until I was supposed to lead the weekly meditation at the temple. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be present, calm, and guide others in mindfulness. But as a carpenter, I was expected to help people, to mend what was broken, especially something as precious as a child\u2019s favorite toy.\n\nMy mind raced. If I focused on the repair, I\u2019d be late for the meditation, letting down the group that relied on me for guidance. If I left now, Mrs. Lee\u2019s son would go another day without his comfort. My hands trembled slightly, torn between the gentle discipline of my craft and the peaceful duty of my faith. The scent of sawdust mingled with the memory of incense, and I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which to serve first."}
