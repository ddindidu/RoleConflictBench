My passenger, a nervous businessman, kept glancing at his watch and muttering about missing his flight. I could feel his anxiety radiating from the back seat, and I knew he expected me to get him to the airport on time, no matter the weather. My hands gripped the wheel tighter, every turn a careful negotiation between safety and urgency.\n\nMy phone buzzed in the cupholder.
