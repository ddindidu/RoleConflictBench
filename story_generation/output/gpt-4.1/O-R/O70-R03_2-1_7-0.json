I need it urgently.\u201d As a delivery person, I knew I had to respond quickly and professionally, reassuring them and tracking down their order. But my heart pounded with another kind of urgency. Today was the monthly food drive at the convent, and as a nun, I was expected to be there, helping to prepare meals and offer comfort to those in need. The sisters counted on me, and the faces of the people we served flashed through my mind. I could almost hear Sister Agnes\u2019s gentle reminder: \u201cCharity is our calling.\u201d Yet, the company expected me to be available, responsive, and polite to every customer, no matter what. My hands trembled as I typed a reply, torn between the demands of my job and my devotion to service. The minutes ticked by, each one pulling me in two directions, and I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing down on my shoulders."}
