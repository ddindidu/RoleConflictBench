The sun beat down, and the usual crowd splashed and laughed. My mind, though, kept drifting to the church hall, where I was supposed to be leading the workshop for our community leaders. I\u2019d spent weeks preparing, knowing how much they relied on me to guide them through the intricacies of our faith. But here, at the pool, I was the only lifeguard on duty. I noticed a few swimmers edging toward the deep end, nothing alarming yet, but I knew my job was to watch them without distraction. My phone buzzed with a message: \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for you to start.\u201d I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the red cross on my shirt, the collar in my bag. The congregation expected spiritual guidance, the pool demanded vigilance. I gripped the armrest, heart pounding, torn between the call to shepherd souls and the duty to protect lives."}
