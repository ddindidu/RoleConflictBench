It was only Wednesday, and I was already on track to smash my weekly quota. The thrill of success buzzed in my chest, but it was quickly overshadowed by the reminder vibrating in my pocket: today was the start of Navaratri, and my family was waiting for me at the temple, hours away. As a Hindu, I was expected to be present, to chant, to offer flowers, to fast, and to immerse myself in the rituals that connected me to my ancestors and my faith. But as a telemarketer, I was expected to keep calling, to keep selling, to keep the numbers climbing. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t lose momentum!\u201d\u2014while my mother\u2019s gentle voice reminded me, \u201cThis festival comes once a year, beta.\u201d My heart pounded as I weighed the headset in my hand, torn between the ringing phones and the distant sound of temple bells, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
