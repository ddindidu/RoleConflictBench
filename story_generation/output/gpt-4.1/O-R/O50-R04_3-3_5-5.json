I wiped the sweat from my brow, hands blackened with grease, as I stared at the trembling machine. If I didn\u2019t act now, the whole line could grind to a halt\u2014production would stop, and the workers would be sent home. My supervisor\u2019s words from this morning rang in my ears: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime today. You\u2019re the only one who can fix it.\u201d\n\nBut my phone buzzed with reminders from the mosque committee. Today was not just any Friday\u2014it was the day our community celebrated the completion of the new prayer hall. Families had come from neighboring towns, and the congregation was waiting for me, their imam, to deliver the sermon that would mark this milestone. I could picture the expectant faces, the children in their best clothes, the elders who had contributed so much.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stood between the shrieking machine and the call to prayer, torn by the weight of two worlds, each demanding all of me at the same moment."}
