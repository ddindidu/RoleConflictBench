My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cPush harder, don\u2019t let up. We need you to break records this week.\u201d I could almost feel the weight of their expectations pressing down on me, the promise of a bonus and recognition just within reach. But as I dialed the next number, my thoughts drifted to the letter from my doctor, the one that said my health might not allow me to travel much longer. This year could be my only chance to perform Hajj, a pillar of my faith I\u2019d dreamed of fulfilling since childhood. My family\u2019s voices, full of hope and encouragement, mingled with the relentless demands of my job. I felt torn, caught between the pressure to keep selling and the spiritual call that grew louder with every passing day. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations of my boss against the sacred duty I owed to myself and my faith, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
