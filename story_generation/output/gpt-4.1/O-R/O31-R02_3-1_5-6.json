I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes until I was supposed to welcome the committee into the parish hall. But the dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent: a violent assault in the park, bystanders at risk. My badge felt heavy on my chest, the weight of duty pressing down. As a police officer, I knew I was expected to respond immediately, to protect those in danger, to be the shield between chaos and safety. Yet, as a priest, I was also expected to be present for my parishioners, to guide them, to nurture their faith, especially now as we prepared for a new season of learning and growth. My phone buzzed with a reminder about the meeting, and I could already imagine the disappointment in their faces if I didn\u2019t show. My heart pounded, torn between the siren\u2019s call and the quiet sanctuary, between the urgent need for protection and the steady need for spiritual leadership. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, Bible in the other, caught between two worlds that both needed me now."}
