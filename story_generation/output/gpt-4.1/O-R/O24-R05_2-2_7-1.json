As a judge, I was expected to stay current with every legal shift, and now an attorney had just cited a fresh appellate decision that could change the course of tomorrow\u2019s hearing. I needed to read it, analyze it, and be ready to rule with authority. But as a rabbi, I was also expected to prepare a meaningful sermon for the Shabbat service, which was only hours away. My congregation looked to me for guidance, for words that would uplift and inspire them. I could feel the tension in my chest as I glanced between the thick legal opinion on my screen and the blank page where my sermon should be taking shape. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent, and both were sacred in their own way. I closed my eyes, torn between the law and the spirit, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
