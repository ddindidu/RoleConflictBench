As a judge, I was expected to write a clear, thorough judgment\u2014findings of fact, conclusions of law, every detail precise. The deadline loomed, and the parties deserved a timely, well-reasoned decision. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the daily prayer service at the chapel. As a priest, my community looked to me for spiritual guidance, for the comfort of routine prayers, even if today\u2019s service was optional. I could hear the faint sound of the bell calling the faithful. My mind tugged in two directions: the duty to justice, the call to serve God and my congregation. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on my shoulders, each demanding my presence, each expecting my best. My heart pounded as I stared at the blank page, torn between the silence of the courtroom and the quiet sanctuary of prayer, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
