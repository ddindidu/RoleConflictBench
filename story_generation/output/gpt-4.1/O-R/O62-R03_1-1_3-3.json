As a lifeguard, I knew the rules: keep everything orderly, safe, and ready. The head supervisor had reminded us just yesterday\u2014no detail too small. But as I reached for the first chair, the chapel bell tolled, echoing through the humid morning air. My heart tightened. As a nun, I was expected to be present for morning prayers, to join my sisters in devotion and unity. The convent\u2019s order was strict; lateness was frowned upon, a sign of wavering commitment. I stood frozen, the weight of my whistle pressing against my habit, torn between the discipline of my duty at the pool and the sacred rhythm of prayer. The minutes ticked by, each one a silent accusation. Should I realign the chairs, risking being late for prayers, or leave them, betraying my responsibility as a lifeguard? My hands trembled as I hovered between the two worlds, feeling the pull of both, unable to move."}
