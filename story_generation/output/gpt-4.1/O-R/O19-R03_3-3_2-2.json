Every decimal, every milligram, had to be perfect\u2014one slip could mean disaster for the patient. My mind raced through the calculations, double-checking, triple-checking, as the clock ticked closer to noon. That was when I was supposed to meet the mayor and the sisters at the parish hall. The hurricane had left so many without shelter, and the mayor pleaded for my help to coordinate the relief effort. As a nun, I was expected to be there, to comfort, to organize, to serve.
