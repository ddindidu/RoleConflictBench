The roads were clear, the city just waking up, and I knew I could make good time on my morning fares. But my mind kept drifting to the convent, to the letter from Mother Superior tucked in my bag. She\u2019d asked me to lead daily reflections for the retreat\u2014an honor, but also a heavy responsibility. I was expected to spend hours in spiritual study, preparing words to guide my sisters. Yet here I was, behind the wheel, watching the meter tick, alert to every pedestrian and traffic sign. I couldn\u2019t afford to lose my license or endanger my passengers, but every moment spent driving felt like time stolen from prayer and preparation.
