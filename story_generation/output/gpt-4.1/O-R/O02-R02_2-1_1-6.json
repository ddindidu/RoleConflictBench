The engineering team\u2019s group chat buzzed with messages\u2014stakeholders wanted a working prototype by next week, and my manager\u2019s tone was clear: this was make-or-break for the project. I was supposed to be finalizing the design specs, troubleshooting the last bugs, and preparing a demo. Every minute counted. But at the same time, my phone vibrated with a reminder: tonight was the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series at church. As the priest, I was expected to lead, to inspire, to lay out a vision for the coming season. The parish council and the catechists would be looking to me for guidance and energy. I could picture the faces of the adults who\u2019d be attending, hoping for something meaningful. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014my mind racing with circuit diagrams and lesson plans, my heart heavy with the knowledge that I couldn\u2019t give my best to both. The pressure from my engineering team and the trust of my parishioners pressed in on me, and I sat frozen, torn between two worlds that both needed all of me."}
