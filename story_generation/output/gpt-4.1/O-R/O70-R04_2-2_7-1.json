The message was from a customer, asking impatiently about the status of their delivery. As a delivery person, I knew I had to respond quickly and politely, reassuring them and possibly checking on their order. But as I glanced inside, I saw the congregation gathering, their eyes searching for me. The regular backup imam was away, and everyone expected me to lead the prayer on time. My heart pounded as I stood at the threshold, torn between the duty to my customer and the responsibility to my community. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my immediate attention, each expecting me to fulfill my promise. I hesitated, phone in hand, the call to prayer echoing softly in the background, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
