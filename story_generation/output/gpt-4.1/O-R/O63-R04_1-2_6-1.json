As a telemarketer, I was supposed to take my break at a set time, but today the call volume was light, and my supervisor had casually mentioned we could be flexible. Still, I knew the company expected us to stick to our schedules, and I didn\u2019t want to set a bad example. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee: the regular backup imam was out sick, and the congregation was gathering, waiting for someone to lead them. I could almost hear the quiet anticipation in the prayer hall, the community looking to me for guidance and presence. My heart pounded as I weighed the silent office around me against the echoing call of duty from the mosque. I felt torn, the expectations of my job and my faith pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
