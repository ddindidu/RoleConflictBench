The foreman\u2019s words from yesterday echoed in my mind: \u201cWe start at seven sharp. No exceptions. And don\u2019t forget\u2014safety first.\u201d I pulled on my hard hat, ready to set an example for the crew. But as I stepped onto the gravel, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mary, a member of my congregation. \u201cPastor, can you talk? I really need someone right now.\u201d I could almost hear the tremor in her voice through the text.\n\nI glanced at the clock\u20146:55. If I called her, I\u2019d be late, and the crew would see me breaking the very rules I preached about. But if I ignored her, I\u2019d be failing her as a pastor, turning away someone in pain. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge of the site, torn between the responsibility to keep my team safe and the call to offer comfort. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and for a moment, I just stood there, caught between two worlds."}
