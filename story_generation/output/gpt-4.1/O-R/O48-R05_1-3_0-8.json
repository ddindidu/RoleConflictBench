I glanced at the screen and saw a message from the synagogue board: \u201cRabbi, the Cohen family needs you. Their father just passed. They\u2019re asking for a funeral this morning.\u201d My heart clenched. As a nursing assistant, I knew Mrs. Goldstein depended on me for her daily care\u2014she couldn\u2019t eat or dress without my help. But as a rabbi, I was expected to be there for my congregants in their moments of deepest need, to guide them through grief and perform the sacred rituals of farewell. I could feel the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders, the starched scrubs and the rabbinic collar. Mrs. Goldstein looked up at me, waiting patiently for her spoonful of oatmeal, while my mind raced with prayers and eulogies. I stood there, torn, the demands of compassion pulling me in two directions, unsure which duty to answer first."}
