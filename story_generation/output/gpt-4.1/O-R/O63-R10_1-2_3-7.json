The sales board glows with my name near the top\u2014my numbers are soaring, and my manager\u2019s praise still rings in my ears. I know if I keep this up, I\u2019ll not only meet but crush my weekly quota. But as I glance at the clock, my heart tightens. Tonight is the puja at my uncle\u2019s house, a ceremony my family has been planning for weeks. I promised my parents I\u2019d be there early, dressed in my best kurta, ready to help with the preparations and join in the prayers. Yet, the phone lines are hot, and every call could mean another sale, another step closer to a bonus. My manager expects me to ride this momentum, to stay late if I can. My family expects my presence, my respect for tradition. I stare at my calendar, torn between the ringing phone and the sacred chants that will soon fill my uncle\u2019s home, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
