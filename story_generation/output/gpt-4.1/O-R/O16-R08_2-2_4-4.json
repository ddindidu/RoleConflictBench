She asks about every detail\u2014medication, diet, what to expect. I know my duty as her doctor is to be patient, clear, and compassionate, to answer every question until she feels reassured. But my mind keeps drifting to the office function this afternoon. The invitation said \u201cbusiness casual,\u201d and I know from past events that most of my colleagues will be dressed in ways that don\u2019t align with my own standards of modesty as a Muslim. I feel the pressure to fit in, to not stand out or seem distant, but I also feel the weight of my faith\u2019s expectations. I glance at the clock, aware that I\u2019ll need to change soon. My heart pounds as I try to focus on Mrs. Rahman\u2019s concerns, but the thought of walking into that room, possibly being judged for my attire, tugs at me. I want to be the doctor my patients need, and the Muslim I strive to be, but right now, those roles feel impossibly far apart."}
