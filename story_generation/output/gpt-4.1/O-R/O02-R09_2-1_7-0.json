Management was waiting for my estimates\u2014firm numbers, not the vague ranges I\u2019d given last week. They needed to lock in the quarterly roadmap, and I was the only engineer with enough experience to break down the tasks accurately. My phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: \u201cJewish study with kids, 7:00 PM.\u201d I\u2019d promised my children we\u2019d explore the story of Passover tonight, something I\u2019d been looking forward to all week. Teaching them about our traditions, our history, felt like a sacred responsibility\u2014one I didn\u2019t want to keep postponing. But the project planning session was running late, and my manager had just messaged, \u201cCan you stay on for another hour?\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the team counting on my expertise, my family counting on my presence. My mind raced, torn between the demands of my profession and the values I wanted to pass on. I sat frozen, unable to decide which expectation to let down."}
