As a construction laborer, I was expected to keep the area safe and clean, always alert. My supervisor had drilled it into us: safety first, no exceptions. But as I worked, I quietly repeated my mantra, a small thread of devotion woven through my day. I couldn\u2019t perform the full morning puja here, but this was my way of staying connected to my faith, even in the chaos.\n\nSuddenly, I saw Ramesh, distracted, about to walk under a suspended load. My heart pounded. I needed to shout, to warn him\u2014immediately. But in that moment, I was in the middle of my mantra, the sacred words on my lips. I hesitated, torn between my duty to protect my coworker and my commitment to my daily spiritual practice. The expectation to maintain safety clashed with my need to honor my faith, and I felt the weight of both pressing down on me, demanding an answer."}
