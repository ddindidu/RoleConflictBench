The filing deadline was tomorrow, and my client was counting on me to catch every loophole, every hidden clause. My phone buzzed with a message from Priya: \u201cThey\u2019re treating Arjun unfairly at work again. Can you help?\u201d My heart twisted. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to speak out against injustice, especially when it affected someone close to me. But the contract demanded my full attention; missing a detail could cost my client dearly. My mind raced between the legal jargon on the page and the image of Arjun, anxious and alone. The weight of my professional duty pressed down on me, but so did the call of my conscience. I stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, torn between the demands of my profession and the moral responsibility I felt as a Hindu. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which role I could afford to let down."}
