My shift as a housekeeping cleaner had just started, and I could already feel the weight of the day pressing on me. The supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cAlways use gloves, masks, and follow every hygiene step\u2014no shortcuts.\u201d Lately, I\u2019d noticed some of my coworkers skipping steps, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do the same. The protocols were strict, and I felt responsible for keeping the place safe.\n\nBut today was also the day I led the weekly group meditation at the temple. As a Buddhist, I was expected to guide others in mindfulness, to be calm and present, to help everyone find peace. The session was in an hour, and I was supposed to be there early to prepare the space and center myself.\n\nMy hands trembled as I reached for the cleaning supplies. If I rushed through my tasks or skipped any safety steps, I could make it to the meditation on time. But if I followed every protocol, I\u2019d be late, letting down the group and my own spiritual practice. The demands of both roles pulled at me, and I stood frozen, torn between duty and devotion."}
