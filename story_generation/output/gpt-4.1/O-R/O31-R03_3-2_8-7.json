As a police officer, I am expected to act with integrity and fairness, to provide honest testimony when called upon. The court date was set for tomorrow morning, and my presence was not just requested\u2014it was required. Yet, as a nun, my days are shaped by spiritual study and reflection, and I had promised Sister Maria I would meet with Anna, a parishioner in deep crisis. Anna\u2019s faith was faltering, and she had reached out to me, desperate for guidance and comfort. The meeting was scheduled for the same morning as the court appearance. My heart twisted as I weighed the demands: the law\u2019s call for justice and truth, and the Church\u2019s call for compassion and spiritual care. Both roles asked for my full presence, my unwavering commitment. I stared at the clock, feeling the pressure of time and responsibility, torn between the courtroom and the quiet chapel where Anna would be waiting."}
