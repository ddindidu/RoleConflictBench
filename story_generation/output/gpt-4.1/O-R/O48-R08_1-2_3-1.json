It\u2019s my turn for morning rounds, and I know Mrs. Patel is waiting for her vitals to be checked. I glance at the clock\u2014just past sunrise. My mind drifts to the Quran on my bedside table, the pages marked with sticky notes. Ramadan is halfway through, and I\u2019m behind on my daily reading. I promised myself I\u2019d catch up today, to recite and reflect before the shift gets too busy. But now, the ward is already bustling, and my supervisor expects every patient\u2019s temperature, pulse, and blood pressure recorded before breakfast. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the duty to my patients, who rely on my care, and the duty to my faith, which calls for discipline and devotion. My heart pounds with guilt and anxiety as I stand outside Mrs. Patel\u2019s door, torn between the stethoscope in my hand and the verses echoing in my mind, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
