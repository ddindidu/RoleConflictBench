As a judge, I know I must stay current, for justice demands nothing less than an informed mind. Yet, as I reach for the journal, the convent bell tolls, and Sister Maria rushes in, her face drawn with concern. The family next door has lost everything in a fire. They need food, clothing, comfort\u2014immediate, tangible help. My heart aches for them, and as a nun, I am expected to serve, to be present in their suffering. I glance at the journal, then at the door, torn between the duty to my profession and the call of compassion. The weight of both robes\u2014judicial and religious\u2014presses on my shoulders, each demanding my full attention, each necessary, each urgent. My mind races, caught in the impossible space between the law and love, between the bench and the chapel, knowing that whatever I choose, a part of me will be left wanting."}
