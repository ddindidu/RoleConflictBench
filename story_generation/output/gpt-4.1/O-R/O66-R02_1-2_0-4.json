The passenger slid into the back seat, mentioning he was just heading to a casual lunch, no rush. I nodded, but my mind was elsewhere. In less than an hour, I was supposed to meet with Mrs. Carter at the church\u2014she\u2019d called in tears last night, desperate for guidance about her son. As a priest, I knew how much she needed someone to listen, to offer comfort and counsel. But as a taxi driver, I had a responsibility to this man in my back seat, to get him safely and promptly to his destination, no matter how relaxed his schedule seemed. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. Should I take the quickest route and risk being late for Mrs. Carter, or ask the passenger if I could end the ride early, possibly disappointing him? The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
