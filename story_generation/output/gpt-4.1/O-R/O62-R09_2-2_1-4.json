My stomach rumbled\u2014a sharp reminder that I hadn\u2019t eaten since dawn. I glanced at my watch; my break was coming up, but not for another hour. The only kosher vendor in the area was a ten-minute walk away, and if I didn\u2019t go soon, I\u2019d miss my chance to eat before my shift ended. But just then, I noticed a swimmer in the middle of the pool, their strokes growing erratic, head bobbing awkwardly. My training screamed at me to stay alert, to never leave my post, especially when someone might be in trouble. Yet, my faith tugged at me too, the expectation to keep kosher, to honor the laws that shaped my daily life. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to protect lives, and my commitment to my beliefs\u2014each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do next."}
