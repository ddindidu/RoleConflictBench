I glanced at the clock\u2014just ten minutes until the family was due at the church for their child\u2019s final sacrament preparation, a session I had promised to lead. As a pharmacist, I knew I should take time to counsel Mrs. Lee, ask about her medical history, and ensure she chose the safest option. But as a priest, I felt the weight of the family\u2019s expectations; this session was crucial for their child\u2019s spiritual journey, and they had rearranged their schedules for me. My mind raced, torn between my duty to provide thorough care to Mrs. Lee and my commitment to guide the family at church. I could feel the tension tightening in my chest, knowing that whichever role I prioritized, I would be letting someone down."}
