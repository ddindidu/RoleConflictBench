The temple bell would soon call for the evening chant, and I was expected to be there, robed and ready, joining the community in recitation and stillness. Yet, in front of me, a group of new staff hovered uncertainly around the old hydraulic press, manuals unopened, safety goggles askew. Their supervisor had left early, trusting me to guide them, but I could see their confusion and impatience. They wanted to finish the batch before the end of their shift, but I knew the risks\u2014one wrong move, and someone could be seriously hurt. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cChanting at 6:15.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. The temple expected my presence, my calm, my devotion.
