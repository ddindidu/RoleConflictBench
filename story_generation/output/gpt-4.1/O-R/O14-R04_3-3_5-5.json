The journal\u2019s deadline was tonight\u2014years of work depended on this submission. My phone buzzed with reminders from my lab team, their messages urgent, expecting my leadership and accuracy. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, my heart pounded for another reason. The mosque was already filling up. Today\u2019s Friday sermon was special; families had come from distant towns to mark our community\u2019s milestone. As imam, I was expected to deliver a thoughtful, inspiring khutbah, to guide and uplift everyone present. I could already picture the hopeful faces waiting for me, trusting me to be present in body and spirit. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest\u2014my duty to truth and science, my responsibility to faith and community. I felt torn, knowing I could not give my best to both at once. My mind raced, wrestling with the impossible choice, as the minutes slipped away."}
