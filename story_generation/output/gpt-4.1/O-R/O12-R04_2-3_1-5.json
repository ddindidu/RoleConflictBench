The new feature was almost done, but my team expected nothing less than clean, efficient code\u2014anything less would let them down and risk the project\u2019s reputation. My phone buzzed with reminders: today was Friday, and not just any Friday. The mosque was full, people had come from neighboring towns to hear my sermon marking our community\u2019s milestone. I could already picture the expectant faces, the trust they placed in me to guide and inspire them. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock. If I left now, the code would remain unoptimized, my team\u2019s faith in my professionalism shaken. If I stayed to fix it, I\u2019d miss the sermon, disappointing a congregation that needed me. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. I closed my eyes, torn between the silent logic of code and the living pulse of my community, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
