As I walked toward the scaffolding, I noticed a slick, oily puddle right in the main walkway. My supervisor always says safety comes first\u2014any spill, no matter how small, must be cleaned up immediately. I knew if I left it, someone could slip, maybe get hurt. I reached for the mop, but my phone buzzed. A message from the monastery: \u201cWe need you now. The festival begins at dawn. Please help with the altar and lanterns.\u201d This festival only happens once a year, and as a practicing Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to be there, to serve the community and honor the teachings. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014my duty to keep my coworkers safe, and my commitment to my spiritual community. I stood there, mop in hand, torn between the urgent call of my faith and the immediate responsibility of my job, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
