The passenger in the back seat kept checking his watch, anxiety etched on his face. \u201cPlease, can you get me to the station in fifteen minutes? My train leaves soon.\u201d As a taxi driver, I felt the familiar pressure to deliver him safely and on time, weaving through the city\u2019s late afternoon traffic. But my mind kept drifting to the convent, where I was expected to lead the prayer vigil tonight\u2014a rare honor, and one I\u2019d been preparing for all week. The sisters were counting on me to represent our community, to be present in spirit and body. Yet here I was, stuck at a red light, torn between the duty to my passenger and the sacred responsibility awaiting me. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I weighed the urgency in his voice against the silent pull of my faith.

I could feel the minutes slipping away, each one demanding a choice I wasn\u2019t ready to make."}
