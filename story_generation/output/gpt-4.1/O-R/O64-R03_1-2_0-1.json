My manager expects precision\u2014no errors, no delays, even on slow afternoons like this. I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of my uniform and the cross beneath it. Just this morning, Sister Agnes called: the family next door lost everything in a fire. They need food, clothes, comfort\u2014now, not later. My heart aches to be with them, to serve as I vowed, but my hands are tied to the register, my duty here just as real. The customers wait, expecting efficiency, while my mind drifts to the charred remains of a home and the faces of children who have nothing. I feel torn, the demands of my two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, each expecting my full devotion. My fingers tremble as I hand back change, caught between the call of compassion and the rules of my job, unsure which voice to answer first."}
