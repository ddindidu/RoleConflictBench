Today was the most significant religious holiday of the year, and as the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers and rituals that brought everyone together. The chapel was already filling up, and I could almost hear the distant hum of hymns and anticipation. But here I was, watching over the pool, knowing that even a moment\u2019s distraction could mean disaster. Suddenly, I noticed a swimmer flailing near the middle, their strokes growing frantic. My heart pounded\u2014every instinct screamed at me to stay alert, to be ready to dive in. Yet, my phone buzzed with messages from the congregation, asking when I would arrive. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait. I gripped the armrests, torn between the sacred call of my faith and the immediate responsibility to protect lives, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds as the minutes ticked by."}
