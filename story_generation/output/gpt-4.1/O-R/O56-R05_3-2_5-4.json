I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes to six. The salon was supposed to close, but more pressing, I was due at the synagogue in fifteen minutes to teach the children their weekly Torah lesson. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cReligious school starts soon!\u201d I could already picture the kids waiting, their parents expecting me to guide them, to be patient and wise. But here, in my apron, scissors still in hand, I was expected to be calm, attentive, and fix this woman\u2019s hair, no matter how late it was. My heart pounded as I tried to listen to her complaints, but my mind was already at the synagogue, feeling the weight of both my scissors and my siddur. I stood there, torn, the demands of my two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
