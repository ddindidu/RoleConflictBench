My headset feels heavy, and my eyes sting from staring at the screen. The phone queue is relentless\u2014calls keep coming, and management has sent another reminder: \u201cBreaks must be logged and strictly timed.\u201d I know I\u2019m expected to take my scheduled break soon, but even then, I\u2019m supposed to be quick, efficient, and back on the line before the next wave of calls.\n\nBut tonight, my community\u2019s Quran study circle meets. We\u2019re discussing verses I haven\u2019t read yet, and I promised myself I\u2019d recite and reflect before joining. As a Muslim, I feel the weight of that commitment. The group expects me to be prepared, to contribute thoughtfully, and I want to honor that. Yet, if I use my break to read, I\u2019ll need more time than allowed, risking a warning from my supervisor. My heart pounds as I stare at the break request form, torn between the demands of my job and my faith, unsure which expectation I can afford to disappoint."}
