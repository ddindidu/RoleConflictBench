A man was attacking another, fists flying, and a crowd had gathered, fear etched on their faces. As a police officer, my training screamed at me to act fast\u2014protect the victim, stop the violence, keep everyone safe. My hand hovered over my taser, adrenaline surging. But as a Christian, I remembered Christ\u2019s teachings: turn the other cheek, love your enemy, seek peace. The assailant\u2019s rage was wild, but I saw the pain in his eyes, the desperation. Could I use force, knowing my faith called me to compassion and forgiveness? The crowd\u2019s shouts grew louder, demanding action. My badge weighed heavy on my chest, but so did the cross I wore beneath my uniform. I stood frozen for a heartbeat, torn between my duty to protect and my calling to show mercy, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
