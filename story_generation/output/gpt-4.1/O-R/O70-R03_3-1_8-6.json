My Bible and journal waited on the desk, sunlight slanting through the window, promising peace. But just as I settled in, my phone buzzed\u2014work. A customer\u2019s message popped up, asking about a package that, I realized with a sinking feeling, had been delayed at the depot. As a delivery person, I was expected to respond quickly, politely, and with solutions, even when I had none. My fingers hovered over the screen, torn. The convent expected me to be present, to set aside worldly distractions and focus on spiritual reflection. Yet my other job demanded immediate attention, professionalism, and calm reassurance. I felt the tension coil in my chest\u2014if I answered, I\u2019d break the silence I so rarely found; if I ignored it, I\u2019d fail a customer and risk my job. The two worlds pressed in, each asking for all of me, and I sat there, phone in hand, heart pulled in two directions."}
