As a judge, I knew I had to review it thoroughly before the next session\u2014my duty demanded I stay current, impartial, and prepared. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from my childhood friend, Rajesh. He was being treated unfairly at work, and he pleaded for my advice, my support. As a Hindu, I was raised to uphold dharma\u2014moral and ethical principles, to stand up for what is right, especially for those I care about.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed on me. The law required my undivided attention, but my conscience urged me to act, to not turn away from injustice. I felt torn, my mind racing between the legal texts on my desk and the pain in Rajesh\u2019s voice. The clock ticked on, and I wrestled with the impossible choice: fulfill my judicial obligation or answer the call of my heart and heritage."}
