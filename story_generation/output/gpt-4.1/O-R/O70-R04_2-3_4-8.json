The item was moderately valuable, and my supervisor had stressed the importance of getting a signature\u2014no exceptions. As I glanced at my watch, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque. Someone had arrived, desperate for guidance, their grief raw and urgent. As the imam, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and wisdom in moments like these. My heart twisted; I could picture the person sitting alone in the prayer hall, waiting for me, needing me. But here I was, tied to this doorstep, unable to leave until the delivery was confirmed. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me\u2014one demanding reliability and procedure, the other compassion and presence. I felt torn, caught between the rules of my job and the call of my faith, uncertain which responsibility should come first."}
