As a lifeguard, I knew that even a second\u2019s distraction could mean disaster, especially with the waves swelling higher than usual. My radio crackled, but my mind was elsewhere\u2014my son\u2019s bar mitzvah was only weeks away, and he still stumbled over his Torah portion. My wife had called earlier, her voice tight with worry, asking if I could come home early to help him practice. I felt the weight of my responsibility as a Jewish parent, to pass on our traditions and guide him through this milestone. But here, on this sand, dozens of lives depended on my vigilance. I could almost hear my father\u2019s voice, reminding me of the importance of both roles. My heart pounded as I watched a group of children wade too far out, while my phone buzzed again with a message from home.
