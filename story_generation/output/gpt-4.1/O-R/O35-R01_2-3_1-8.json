A minor delay up ahead meant I had to adjust the speed, keeping the ride smooth and safe, but every second ticked away at my carefully planned schedule. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about the workshop I was leading tonight as a pastor. The community leaders were counting on me to guide them through challenging theological concepts, to be patient, wise, and fully present. But right now, my mind was split. The passengers behind me expected a punctual, safe journey, while my congregation expected spiritual leadership and clarity. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, the hum of the train mixing with the echo of scripture in my mind. Could I be both the steady hand on the controls and the thoughtful shepherd my community needed? The next signal flashed yellow, and I hesitated, torn between the demands of the tracks and the pulpit, unsure which path to prioritize."}
