My voice is steady as I instruct the jury, but inside, I am already thinking about the meditation session I am supposed to lead in less than an hour. My phone buzzes\u2014my clerk\u2019s urgent face appears at my side, whispering that the Supreme Court has just overturned the very precedent I am explaining. My mind races. As a judge, I am expected to stay current, to halt proceedings and adapt instantly, ensuring justice is served according to the latest law. But as a Buddhist, I am supposed to be present, mindful, and soon, I am to guide others in letting go of distractions and stress. The courtroom\u2019s tension presses in, and I feel my breath catch. I am torn\u2014do I pause everything, risking the meditation group\u2019s peace, or do I delay the court, betraying my duty to the law? My heart pounds, caught between the demands of justice and the call for inner stillness, and I realize I cannot satisfy both at once."}
