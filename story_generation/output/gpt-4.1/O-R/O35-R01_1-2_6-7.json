My phone buzzed with an email from the transit authority\u2014an optional professional development seminar, but the supervisor\u2019s note made it clear that those who signed up would be looked upon favorably. I knew I should respond quickly, show my commitment to the job, and keep up with the latest safety protocols. But my Bible sat open beside me, half-filled with notes for Sunday\u2019s sermon. The congregation expected guidance, clarity, and inspiration, and I hadn\u2019t yet found the right words to address the moral dilemma I wanted to discuss. My mind tugged in two directions: the duty to my passengers and my career, and the responsibility to my flock, who looked to me for spiritual leadership. I stared at the blinking cursor in the email, feeling the weight of both uniforms I wore\u2014one blue, one black\u2014wondering which expectation I should meet first."}
