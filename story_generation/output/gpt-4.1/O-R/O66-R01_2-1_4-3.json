As a taxi driver, I knew I had to be extra cautious\u2014other cars darted between lanes, their impatience making every intersection a gamble. My eyes flicked to the rearview mirror, watching for sudden stops, my mind rehearsing defensive maneuvers. But my phone buzzed on the seat beside me, a message from Mrs. Kim, a church member who\u2019d been struggling lately. I\u2019d promised to check in, to offer comfort as her pastor, and I could almost hear her voice trembling with loneliness. The urge to reach out, to send a few kind words, gnawed at me. Yet, I couldn\u2019t risk taking my eyes off the road, not in this weather, not with so many lives in my hands. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding vigilance and safety, the other compassion and presence. My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do next, torn between the expectations of the road and the needs of my flock."}
