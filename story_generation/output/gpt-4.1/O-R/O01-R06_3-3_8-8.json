My phone buzzed with messages from team leads\u2014another delay, another conflict between departments. As the architect, everyone looked to me to keep things moving, to be decisive and efficient, to push the team hard enough to meet our client\u2019s expectations. I could feel the pressure mounting, the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders.\n\nThen, in the middle of the chaos, one of my junior architects came to me, eyes red and voice trembling. She\u2019d made a mistake that would set us back even further. The rest of the team was already frustrated, and I knew they expected me to be firm, maybe even harsh, to make an example and keep everyone in line. But as a Christian, I felt the call to show her compassion, to offer forgiveness and support, to be the kind of leader Jesus would want me to be. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding something different, and I sat there, heart pounding, torn between the expectations of my profession and the teachings of my faith."}
