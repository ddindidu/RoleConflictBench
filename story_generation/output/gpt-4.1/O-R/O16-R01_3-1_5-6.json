The family waited outside, their faces tight with worry. As a doctor, I knew I had to tell them the truth about their loved one\u2019s diagnosis\u2014clear, honest, but gentle. I rehearsed the words in my mind, searching for the right balance between medical facts and empathy. But as a pastor, I also felt the urge to offer comfort, to share hope, maybe even a story from scripture that might ease their pain. Earlier that day, at a community gathering, I\u2019d casually mentioned a parable about faith in the face of suffering. Some found solace, but others seemed uncomfortable, wary of mixing faith with medicine. Now, as I prepared to face the family, I felt torn. Should I stick strictly to my medical role, or let my pastoral side offer spiritual comfort? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I could feel my heart pounding as I reached for the door, uncertain which part of myself would speak first."}
