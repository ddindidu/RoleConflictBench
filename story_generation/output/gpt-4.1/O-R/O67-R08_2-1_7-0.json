A call had come in\u2014someone with a sprained ankle, nothing life-threatening, but protocol demanded urgency. I gripped the steering wheel, glancing at the clock. It was almost Maghrib, the time I usually set aside to recite and reflect on the Quran, a peaceful ritual that anchored my evenings. Tonight, I had looked forward to it, knowing my shift would be quiet. But now, the wail of the siren cut through my thoughts as I navigated the thick traffic, every horn and brake light a reminder of the responsibility I carried. My duty as a driver was clear: get there quickly, but safely. Yet, my heart tugged toward the spiritual calm I was about to miss. The Quran sat on the passenger seat, its cover closed, waiting. I felt torn, the city\u2019s chaos outside clashing with the serenity I craved inside, both roles demanding my full attention, neither willing to wait."}
