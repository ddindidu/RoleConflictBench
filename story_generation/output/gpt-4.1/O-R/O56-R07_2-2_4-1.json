She was a first-time visitor, and I\u2019d tried my best to match the colour she\u2019d described. But as she caught her reflection in the mirror, her lips pressed into a thin line. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit darker than I expected,\u201d she said quietly. My heart sank. I knew I should stay, listen, and do whatever I could to make her happy\u2014after all, that\u2019s what a good hairdresser does. But tonight was the memorial service at the temple, and as a Buddhist, I was expected to be there, to chant and support the grieving families. The ceremony was important, not just for me, but for the whole community. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest: the need to be present for my client, to fix her hair and her mood, and the pull of my spiritual duty, the promise I\u2019d made to my sangha. My hands trembled as I reached for the towel, torn between the mirror and the memory hall, unsure which path to follow."}
