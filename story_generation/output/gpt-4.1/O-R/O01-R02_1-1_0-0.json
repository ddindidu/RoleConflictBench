As an architect, I knew the importance of precision\u2014every detail mattered for safety and compliance. Today, I noticed a few minor inconsistencies in the building plan. They were small, unlikely to cause immediate issues, but my professional integrity nagged at me to address them before moving forward. Yet, the clock ticked closer to noon, and as the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the daily prayer service. It was routine and optional, but I knew how much comfort it brought to the handful who attended. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPrayer service in 10 minutes.\u201d I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014one demanding my presence for spiritual guidance, the other urging me to ensure the safety of a future building. My heart pounded as I stared at the plans, torn between the quiet sanctuary and the silent responsibility on my desk, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my full self to both at once."}
