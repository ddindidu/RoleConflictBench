As the convent\u2019s accountant, it was my duty to stay ahead of any changes, to ensure our finances remained above reproach. The seminar was a rare opportunity\u2014experts would discuss upcoming regulations that could affect our charitable status. Missing it might mean missing crucial information, and I felt the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders.\n\nBut just as I was about to register, Mother Superior entered my office. She smiled gently and asked if I would lead the daily reflections during our retreat next week. It was an honor, a chance to guide my sisters in spiritual growth, and I knew how much the community valued these moments of shared contemplation. Yet, the retreat coincided exactly with the seminar dates.\n\nMy mind raced. The community expected me to be present, spiritually grounded, and available. The convent needed me to be diligent, informed, and precise. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, each role demanding my full attention, each expectation valid and pressing. I closed my eyes, searching for clarity, but the conflict only deepened within me."}
