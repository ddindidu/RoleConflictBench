The carpenter caught my eye, tapping his foot, waiting for the next load so he could keep the framing on schedule. My foreman had made it clear: no delays, no excuses. But as I set the boards down, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder for Rivka\u2019s final study session before her Beit Din. She\u2019d been preparing for months, and this was the last chance to review the laws and prayers she\u2019d need to know. I pictured her anxious face, the trust she\u2019d placed in me as her rabbi. My hands, rough from work, trembled slightly. The carpenter called out, \u201cHey, you got another load?\u201d I glanced at my phone again, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me apart. The site demanded my strength and speed; my community needed my wisdom and presence. My heart pounded as I stood between the stacks of lumber and the call of Torah, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
