The customer from Maple Street was asking, for the third time today, about the status of their package. I took a deep breath, reminding myself to respond politely and professionally, even though I was running behind and the traffic was relentless. As I typed out a courteous reply, another message popped up\u2014this one from a young couple in my congregation. They wanted to know if I could officiate their wedding next summer, and they hoped for a quick answer so they could book the venue. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: the delivery company expected me to be efficient and responsive, while my community looked to me for guidance and commitment. My mind raced, torn between the immediate demands of my delivery job and the long-term responsibilities of being a rabbi. I stared at my phone, feeling the tension build, unsure which message to answer first or how to balance the expectations that seemed to pull me in opposite directions."}
