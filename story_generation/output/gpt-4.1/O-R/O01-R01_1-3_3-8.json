As an architect, I knew the space needed to be functional above all\u2014simple lines, efficient storage, nothing extravagant. I was almost finished when my phone buzzed with a reminder: the workshop for community leaders was tomorrow. As their pastor, I was expected to guide them through intricate theological concepts, helping them not just understand but live out these principles. My mind drifted from the clean lines of the studio to the tangled questions I\u2019d need to address\u2014grace, justice, forgiveness. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. The architect in me wanted to keep things practical and straightforward, but the pastor in me was called to dig deep, to challenge and inspire. I stared at my half-finished sketch, heart pounding, torn between the clarity of design and the complexity of faith, wondering how I could possibly meet the demands of both worlds."}
