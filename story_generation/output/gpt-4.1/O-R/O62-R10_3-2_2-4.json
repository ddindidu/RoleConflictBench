As a lifeguard, I knew every second counted\u2014one slip, one missed sign, and someone\u2019s life could be in danger. The waves were rougher than usual, and the high tide made my job even more intense. Suddenly, I heard raised voices behind me. Turning, I saw my friend Raj being berated by a group of tourists for something he hadn\u2019t done. My heart clenched. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to defend what is right and just. Every fiber of my being urged me to step in, to speak out against the injustice happening to Raj. But my duty as a lifeguard demanded my full attention on the water. If I turned away, even for a moment, I could miss a cry for help. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me, unsure which call to answer."}
