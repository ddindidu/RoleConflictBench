As a lawyer, I was used to the strict boundaries of confidentiality, the sacred trust between client and counsel. Today, an assistant\u2014new and eager\u2014asked for access to files she didn\u2019t need, just to make her work easier. I knew the rules, the lines I could not cross, but her hopeful eyes made me hesitate. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from the convent: Mother Superior wanted me to lead daily reflections for the retreat. It was an honor, but it meant hours of preparation, deep spiritual study, and presence with my sisters. I felt torn. The law demanded my vigilance and discretion; my faith called for my time and contemplation. Both roles expected my full devotion, but I was only one person. My mind raced, heart heavy, as I tried to reconcile the demands of justice and the call to spiritual leadership, knowing I could not give both what they deserved."}
