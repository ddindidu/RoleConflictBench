Two minutes until the safety briefing\u2014mandatory, no exceptions. The foreman\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe start together, we finish together. No one\u2019s above the rules.\u201d I grabbed my hard hat, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. A message from the church council: \u201cPastor, the workshop is about to begin. The leaders are waiting for your guidance.\u201d I pictured the eager faces, notebooks open, expecting me to unravel the mysteries of faith, to lead them deeper. My heart pounded.
