My watch ticks closer to the hour when the weekly Buddhist study circle gathers, a time I cherish for its quiet reflection and shared wisdom. But tonight, the schedule collides with my duty. The pre-departure check of the train\u2019s non-critical systems is due\u2014routine, yes, but required for safety and punctuality. My supervisor expects diligence; the passengers trust me to keep them safe and on time. Yet, my heart aches to be with my sangha, to discuss the chapter we\u2019ve all struggled to understand, to deepen my practice. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the responsibility to my job, the commitment to my spiritual path. My mind races, torn between the metallic certainty of the train and the gentle call of the Dharma. I close my eyes for a moment, searching for clarity, but the answer eludes me as the minutes slip away."}
