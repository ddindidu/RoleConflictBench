The national continuing education program for pharmacists was scheduled for this Sunday, the same day as our church\u2019s annual service and community outreach. As a pharmacist, I knew how important it was to stay updated\u2014my patients depended on my knowledge, and my license required these credits. Missing the program could set me back professionally, and I\u2019d worked so hard to keep up with the latest treatments.\n\nBut as a Christian, I was expected to be present at church, especially for big events like this. My pastor had personally asked me to help organize the outreach, and I knew the congregation counted on my support. I could already imagine the disappointment in their faces if I didn\u2019t show up. My heart felt heavy, torn between my commitment to my profession and my devotion to my faith community. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I found myself wrestling with guilt and anxiety, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
