As a telemarketer, I was expected to take my scheduled break in exactly ten minutes, no sooner, no later\u2014management tracked every second, and the queue was always full. My supervisor\u2019s reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to lose a single call during peak hours.\u201d But my phone vibrated in my pocket, a gentle reminder from the church app. The main weekly service was about to begin, and as the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers and offer guidance. The congregation would be waiting, expecting my presence and words. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. If I left my desk now, I\u2019d risk a reprimand at work; if I stayed, I\u2019d let down my community. The demands pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat frozen, torn between duty and devotion, unable to move."}
