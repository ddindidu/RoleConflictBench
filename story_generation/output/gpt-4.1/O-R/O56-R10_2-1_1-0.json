A woman stood hesitantly at the entrance, her eyes darting from the row of chairs to the mirrors. I knew the expectation\u2014smile, greet her warmly, make her feel at ease. But just as I opened my mouth, I felt the familiar tug of my other world. It was the time I usually paused, closed my eyes, and whispered my mantra, a small thread connecting me to my faith, even if I couldn\u2019t perform the full ritual in the busy salon. My hands trembled slightly, caught between the urge to honor my daily practice and the professional demand to be present for my client. I could sense her anxiety, waiting for reassurance, while inside, my mind raced, torn between the comfort of my tradition and the responsibility of my role as a hairdresser. The seconds stretched, my heart pounding, as I stood at the crossroads of expectation, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
