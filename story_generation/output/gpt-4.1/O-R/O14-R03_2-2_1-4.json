The specialized spectrometer, booked months in advance, was finally available for just a few hours. My experiment\u2014years in the making\u2014depended on this window. I reviewed my notes, heart pounding with anticipation and anxiety. Then, the chapel bell rang, echoing down the corridor. Sister Agnes appeared at my door, her eyes gentle but insistent. \u201cThe healing service for Sister Maria begins soon. We need you with us.\u201d This was no ordinary prayer; the whole community would gather, united in hope for our ailing sister. I felt the weight of my vows, the expectation to be present, to offer comfort and faith. Yet, the scientist in me screamed at the thought of missing this rare opportunity, the data that could change everything. My hands trembled as I stood between the lab and the chapel, torn by the demands of faith and discovery, each calling me with equal urgency."}
