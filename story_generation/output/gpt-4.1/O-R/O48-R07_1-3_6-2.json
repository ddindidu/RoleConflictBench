She\u2019d been especially quiet lately, and I knew she needed someone to talk to. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to offer more than just medical care\u2014I was supposed to be a companion, a source of comfort. I sat by her bed, listening to her stories, feeling the weight of her loneliness. But in the back of my mind, I couldn\u2019t ignore the gentle chime of my phone: a reminder from the monastery. Today was the annual festival, the one day my Buddhist community truly came together, and I\u2019d promised to help with the dawn preparations. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the patient who needed me now, and toward my spiritual family who counted on my presence. I could feel the tension building inside me, the pressure of being needed in two places at once, each role demanding my full attention, each expectation pulling me further apart."}
