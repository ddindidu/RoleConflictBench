The bride-to-be and her bridesmaids bustled in, their faces tight with nerves. I smiled, welcoming them, trying to project calm and warmth. My job as a hairdresser is to make people feel at ease, especially on days like this. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder for the children\u2019s study group I lead every week at the synagogue. I\u2019d promised the parents I\u2019d teach about Shabbat traditions today, and I know how much the kids look forward to our sessions. I could reschedule, but I\u2019d already shifted the lesson once this month. The parents expect consistency, and I want to be a good role model, passing on our values and stories. Yet, here in the salon, the bride\u2019s anxious eyes meet mine, silently pleading for reassurance and attention. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations\u2014comforting my clients or honoring my commitment to the children. I feel torn, caught between two worlds that both matter deeply to me."}
