The bail hearing had just ended, and the defendant\u2019s anxious family waited for my order to be signed so he could be released. As a judge, I knew the importance of writing a clear, detailed order\u2014any ambiguity could lead to confusion or even injustice. Yet, my phone buzzed with reminders from the mosque committee. Today was Friday, and I was the only imam scheduled to deliver the Khutbah. The congregation had already gathered, expecting my words on a topic I had spent days preparing. My mind raced between the legal language forming in my head and the spiritual message I needed to convey. Both roles demanded my full presence, both communities relying on me. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing from all sides, my heart torn between the duty to uphold the law and the responsibility to guide my community in faith."}
