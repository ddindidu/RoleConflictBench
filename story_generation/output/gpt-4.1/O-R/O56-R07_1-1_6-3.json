My training as a hairdresser echoed in my mind: always wash and condition before cutting. It\u2019s the standard, the expectation\u2014clean hair, manageable for styling, a ritual of care. But her hair was spotless, and she looked so comfortable, trusting me to do what\u2019s best.\n\nAt the same time, I felt the gentle tug of my Buddhist practice. I had planned a quiet ten-minute window between clients, a rare chance to sit in stillness, to breathe and let go. That time was precious, a promise to myself to cultivate mindfulness amid the salon\u2019s constant chatter and clatter.\n\nNow, I stood at a crossroads. If I insisted on washing her hair, I\u2019d lose my meditation window. If I skipped the wash, I\u2019d break the salon\u2019s protocol and risk my professional standards. My mind buzzed with conflicting voices\u2014duty to my craft, duty to my inner peace. I took a slow breath, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, uncertain which to honor."}
