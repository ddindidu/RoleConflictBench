Dust gathers in the corners, and I can\u2019t help but notice the streaks on the windows and the crumbs along the baseboards. The head of housekeeping expects every surface to shine, and I take pride in my work, knowing the sisters and guests rely on a clean, welcoming space. But as I reach for the mop, Sister Agnes approaches, her voice gentle but urgent. \u201cSister, Mrs. Callahan is waiting in the chapel. She needs to talk\u2014she\u2019s struggling with her faith.\u201d\n\nMy heart tightens. As a nun, I am called to offer comfort and guidance, to listen and pray with those in need. But the dust won\u2019t wait, and the supervisor will surely notice if I fall behind. I glance at my watch, feeling the weight of both uniforms\u2014the apron and the habit\u2014pressing down on me. The mop handle feels heavy in my hand, and my mind races with the expectations of spotless floors and a compassionate ear. I stand in the hallway, torn, the echo of Mrs. Callahan\u2019s pain and the silent judgment of unclean corners pulling me in opposite directions."}
