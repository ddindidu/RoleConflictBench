At 10 a.m., I was due in court for a procedural hearing\u2014a minor matter, one that could be postponed with a simple request. But at the same hour, Mrs. Evans, a longtime member of my congregation, was coming to the rectory. She\u2019d called in tears, desperate for guidance about a struggle she\u2019d been carrying alone for months. As a lawyer, I knew my client expected me to be present, to represent them with diligence, no matter how trivial the hearing seemed. As a priest, I felt the weight of Mrs. Evans\u2019s trust, her hope that I could offer comfort and counsel when she needed it most. The demands pressed in from both sides, each role insisting on my presence, my attention, my care. I sat at my desk, torn, the phone in one hand and my Bible in the other, wrestling with the impossible choice between duty and compassion, justice and mercy."}
