He had to catch an international flight, and every minute lost in traffic felt like a personal failure. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get him there safely and on time, but the roads were slick, and visibility was poor. My phone buzzed with a reminder: it was almost time for the afternoon prayer at the mosque. As the imam, I was supposed to lead the congregation, but today, only a handful would gather, and Brother Ahmed could easily step in. Still, I knew some of the elders valued my presence, especially during difficult times. My heart pounded as I weighed the responsibility of delivering my passenger safely and promptly against my duty to the mosque. The storm outside seemed to mirror the turmoil inside me, and I found myself torn, uncertain which road to take."}
