The prescription in my hand was for a simple cold remedy, and I double-checked the label, making sure everything was accurate. My phone buzzed with a reminder from the church group chat: \u201cSee you all tonight! Don\u2019t forget, we need volunteers for the food drive after service.\u201d I felt the familiar tug of guilt. As a pharmacist, I knew my duty was to my patients, ensuring every medication was dispensed safely, no matter how routine. But as a Christian, I was expected to be present, to worship, to serve, to show my commitment to the community. The pharmacy was short-staffed tonight, and I knew if I left early, my coworkers would struggle. Yet, if I stayed, I\u2019d miss the service and let down my church family. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen behind the counter, torn between my responsibilities and my faith, unsure which path to choose."}
