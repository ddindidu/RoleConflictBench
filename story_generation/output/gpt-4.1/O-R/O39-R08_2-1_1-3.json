I put on my comfortable, modest clothes\u2014loose pants and a long-sleeved shirt, just as I always do when I\u2019m around my parents and siblings. But just as I was settling in, my phone buzzed. The foreman needed me at the construction site\u2014someone had called in sick, and they were short-handed. I barely had time to change. At the site, the sun was already beating down, and the work was relentless. The carpenter called out, \u201cHey, can you bring that next load of lumber? We\u2019re falling behind!\u201d I could feel sweat trickling down my back, my modest clothes clinging to me, making every movement harder. The other workers wore shorts and tank tops, moving freely, while I struggled to keep up, feeling their eyes on me. I wanted to do my job well, not slow anyone down, but I also wanted to honor my faith. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my work and my beliefs, unsure which demand I could let down."}
