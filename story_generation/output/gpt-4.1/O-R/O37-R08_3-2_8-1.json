My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cGloves, mask, sanitizer\u2014no exceptions.\u201d I pull on the gloves, feeling the latex snap against my skin, and adjust my mask. Every surface I touch must be spotless, every protocol followed. But as I scrub, my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a reminder for my Quran reading. Ramadan is halfway through, and I\u2019m already behind on my daily quota. Guilt prickles at me. I promised myself I\u2019d catch up today, to honor this sacred month, to feel the peace that comes from reciting and reflecting. But the clock is ticking, and the rooms are many. If I pause to read, I risk falling behind at work, maybe even missing a safety step. If I keep cleaning, I fall further behind in my spiritual duties. My heart pounds with the weight of both expectations, torn between the demands of my job and the devotion of my faith."}
