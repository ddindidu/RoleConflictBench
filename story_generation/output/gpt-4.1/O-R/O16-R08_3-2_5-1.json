As a doctor, I knew I had to speak with Mrs. Rahman\u2019s family, who waited anxiously outside. The results were not good, and I needed to explain everything with clarity and compassion, to answer their questions, to be present for their pain. But as a Muslim, I was also painfully aware that Ramadan\u2019s midpoint had arrived, and I was behind on my daily Quran recitation. The guilt gnawed at me; I had promised myself to keep up, to use this month for spiritual growth, but the hospital\u2019s demands had stretched me thin. My heart ached with the knowledge that both roles expected my full attention\u2014my patients needed my empathy, my faith needed my devotion. I stared at the closed door, torn between the family waiting for answers and the quiet prayer mat in the corner of my office, wrestling with the impossible choice of who I needed to be in this moment."}
