The month-end close is tomorrow, and the ledgers still don\u2019t balance. My manager expects flawless records, no excuses, and I know the consequences of missing the deadline. Yet, my phone buzzes with a gentle reminder: the monastery\u2019s annual festival begins at dawn. As a practicing Buddhist, I\u2019m not just expected to attend, but to help prepare, to be present in body and spirit for the community. The abbot\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cOur presence is our offering.\u201d I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My colleagues count on my accuracy; my sangha counts on my devotion. I stare at the spreadsheet, heart pounding, torn between the silent demands of my profession and the quiet call of my faith."}
