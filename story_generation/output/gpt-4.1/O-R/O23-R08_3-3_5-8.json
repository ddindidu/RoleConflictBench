As a lawyer, my client\u2019s future rests on my shoulders; the trial is set, the jury selected, and the judge has made it clear\u2014no delays. The stakes are high, and my duty is to stand by my client, to fight for justice with every argument I can muster.\n\nBut as a Muslim, I face a different call. My doctor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cIf you want to perform Hajj, it must be this year. Your health may not allow it again.\u201d Hajj is not just a journey; it\u2019s a pillar of my faith, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation. My family\u2019s eyes are full of hope, urging me to fulfill this sacred duty while I still can.\n\nI sit at my desk, legal briefs in one hand, a pamphlet about Hajj in the other. The weight of both worlds presses down on me. My mind races, torn between the courtroom and the Kaaba, between my client\u2019s trust and my Creator\u2019s command. I close my eyes, searching for clarity, but the answer remains just out of reach."}
