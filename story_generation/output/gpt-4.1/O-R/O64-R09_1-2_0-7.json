My manager had asked me to stay an extra hour since someone called in sick, and I agreed, not thinking much of it. But as I glance at the clock, my heart sinks. I\u2019m supposed to be at synagogue soon, chanting a portion I\u2019ve practiced for weeks. My community expects me there, and I promised my family I wouldn\u2019t miss it. But here I am, still in my uniform, with a growing line and no sign of relief. I know the store relies on me to keep things running smoothly, to process every transaction accurately and keep customers happy. Yet, the thought of letting down my congregation, of not fulfilling my commitment, gnaws at me. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding something I can\u2019t give at the same time. My hands move automatically over the register, but my mind is tangled in worry, torn between duty to my job and devotion to my faith."}
