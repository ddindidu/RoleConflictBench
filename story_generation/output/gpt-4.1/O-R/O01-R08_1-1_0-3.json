As an architect, I was trained to spot even the smallest inconsistencies, and today I noticed a few in the building plan. They were minor\u2014nothing that would cause immediate harm or violate any codes, but my professional integrity nagged at me. I knew I should address them, even if it meant more work and possibly delaying the project.\n\nBut today was supposed to be different. I had planned to spend the day at home, relaxing with my family. I wore my most comfortable clothes\u2014loose pajama pants and a short-sleeved T-shirt, something I\u2019d never wear outside but felt fine in around my immediate family. As a Muslim, I always made sure to dress modestly in public, but at home, I let myself relax.\n\nNow, with the possibility of needing to video call my team or even step out to the office, I felt a wave of anxiety. Should I change into more modest attire just in case? Was I compromising my values by staying as I was, or my professional duty by not acting immediately? The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I sat there, torn, unsure which demand to answer first."}
