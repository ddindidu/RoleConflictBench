The package for Mrs. Lee sat on the passenger seat, and I rehearsed my polite greeting, as expected of a professional delivery person. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from Sister Agnes, reminding me that Mrs. Ramirez from the parish was waiting in the chapel, desperate to talk about her crisis of faith. I was supposed to be there, offering comfort and spiritual guidance, not circling the block in a delivery van.\n\nAs I pulled up to Mrs. Lee\u2019s house, I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me. I needed to smile, be efficient, and make small talk about the weather, but my mind was with Mrs. Ramirez, picturing her wringing her hands in the pew, searching for answers only a nun could provide. My heart pounded with guilt and anxiety. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and both women were counting on me for something only I could give. I took a deep breath, package in hand, torn between the doorbell in front of me and the chapel across town."}
