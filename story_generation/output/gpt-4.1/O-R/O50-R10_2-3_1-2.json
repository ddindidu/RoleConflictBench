Can you fix it now?\u201d The sensor error had halted the main unit for half an hour, and every minute meant mounting losses. My mind raced through possible causes\u2014faulty wiring, a software glitch, maybe a misaligned sensor. I needed to focus, to diagnose and repair quickly, but my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder: it was time for my midday prayers.\n\nAs a Hindu, I never missed my daily rituals. The chanting, the offerings, the quiet moments of devotion\u2014they anchored me, gave me peace. My family and community expected me to uphold these practices, and I expected it of myself. But now, the demands of my job pressed in, urgent and unyielding. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds. If I stopped to pray, the factory would lose more time. If I ignored my rituals, I would feel I\u2019d let down my faith and myself. My hands trembled as I stared at the blinking error light, torn between duty and devotion, unsure which call to answer first."}
