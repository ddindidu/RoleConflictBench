The quarterly tax filing deadline looms, and as the company\u2019s accountant, I\u2019m expected to ensure every figure is precise, every regulation followed. My manager\u2019s reminders echo in my mind\u2014no mistakes, no delays. Yet, as I glance at my phone, a calendar alert pops up: the Jewish holiday is just days away. My children\u2019s voices ring in my memory, asking about the blessings they need to learn. As a Jewish parent, it\u2019s my responsibility to teach them our traditions, to pass on the words and melodies that have shaped generations. Guilt gnaws at me; I haven\u2019t found the time to sit with them, to share the stories and prayers. The pressure mounts from both sides\u2014my professional duty demanding late nights at the office, my faith and family calling me home. I stare at the clock, heart pounding, torn between the ledger and the legacy I want to leave my children."}
