The mosque\u2019s minaret was just ahead, and I felt the familiar flutter in my chest\u2014Friday prayer was about to begin. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get my passenger to his destination safely and on time, and today, that was easy; he had plenty of time before his meeting. But as a Muslim, I was about to step into the main prayer hall, and I realized I was still in my work clothes\u2014jeans and a short-sleeved shirt, not the modest attire I usually wore for Jumu\u2019ah. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: the duty to my passenger, who expected a professional, efficient ride, and the duty to my faith, which asked me to present myself respectfully before God. My mind raced, torn between stopping to change and risking my passenger\u2019s schedule, or entering the mosque as I was, feeling exposed and uneasy. The car slowed at a red light, and I gripped the steering wheel, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I would have to let down."}
