The receptionist was free, but Mrs. Patel always liked when I greeted her personally. I could see her looking around, expecting me to come over, offer a warm welcome, maybe even a hug. That\u2019s what makes clients feel at home, and it\u2019s what\u2019s expected of me as a hairdresser. But today was different. I was dressed for Friday prayers, my abaya covering me from neck to ankle, my hijab pinned securely. In a few minutes, I\u2019d be heading to the mosque, and I needed to keep my appearance modest and undisturbed for worship. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my client\u2019s expectation for a friendly, open greeting, and my own need to maintain the dignity and modesty my faith requires, especially before entering the prayer hall. My heart pounded as I hesitated, caught between the warmth of my profession and the quiet strength of my beliefs, unsure which expectation I could meet without betraying the other."}
