As a lawyer, I knew every clause needed my full attention\u2014one oversight could cost my client dearly. My stomach growled, reminding me I hadn\u2019t eaten since morning. I glanced at my watch; lunchtime had come and gone. I was in a small town for this case, and the only kosher-certified vendor was a tiny stand a few blocks away, closing soon. \n\nThe pressure mounted. My legal training demanded I stay focused, finish the review, and meet the deadline. But my Jewish identity, the habits and values I\u2019d carried since childhood, insisted I not compromise on kosher laws, even for convenience. If I left now, I\u2019d lose precious time and risk missing the deadline. If I stayed, I\u2019d go hungry, betraying a core part of who I am. My mind raced, torn between my professional duty and my religious commitment, the weight of both expectations pressing in as I stared at the contracts, unable to move."}
