She looks flustered, explaining she lost her receipt but needs to return it. Store policy is clear\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. My manager expects me to enforce this, no exceptions. The woman\u2019s voice trembles, and I see her desperation. I want to help, but I know the rules.\n\nLater, at a community event, I\u2019m surrounded by laughter and the aroma of food. Platters are passed around, but none have kosher certification. I\u2019m hungry, and everyone expects me to join in, to be part of the celebration. I feel the weight of my tradition, the rules I\u2019ve followed since childhood. My friends urge me to eat, not understanding why I hesitate. I feel torn\u2014between my job\u2019s demands for strict adherence to policy and my faith\u2019s call for unwavering observance. Both roles ask for loyalty, but in these moments, I feel like I\u2019m letting someone down, no matter what I choose."}
