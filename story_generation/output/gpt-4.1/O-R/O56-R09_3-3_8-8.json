She\u2019s my last client before lunch, and her hair is so tangled that I know it\u2019ll take at least another half hour to wash and condition it properly before I can even think about cutting. My phone buzzes in my pocket. I sneak a look: it\u2019s a message from the synagogue. They need one more person for the minyan to say Kaddish at a funeral\u2014right now. My heart pounds. I know how important it is to help someone say the prayer for the dead; without a quorum, the mourner can\u2019t honor their loved one. But Mrs. Goldstein is expecting me to finish her hair, and I can\u2019t just leave her with a head full of suds and tangles. I feel the pressure of both worlds\u2014my hands in her hair, my mind at the synagogue\u2014tugging me in opposite directions."}
