My sales numbers are soaring this week\u2014management will be thrilled if I keep up the pace. The adrenaline of closing deals pulses through me, but as I reach for the next number, my phone buzzes with a calendar reminder: Shabbat is approaching. I\u2019m the rabbi, and the congregation expects a thoughtful sermon, something to guide them through the week\u2019s challenges. My notes for the sermon are scattered, half-formed ideas jotted between calls. I know I should set aside time to reflect, to craft words that matter, but the pressure to keep dialing, to ride this sales streak, is overwhelming. My manager\u2019s praise echoes in my mind, but so does the quiet expectation of my community, waiting for inspiration. I stare at the blinking cursor on my sermon draft, torn between the ringing phone and the silent sanctuary, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
