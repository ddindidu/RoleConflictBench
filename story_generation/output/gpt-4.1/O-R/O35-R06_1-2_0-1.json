This morning, the schedule is tight, and the supervisor\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t delay, even for minor issues.\u201d I begin my routine inspection, but I notice a homeless man sleeping in the last car. He looks exhausted, clutching a worn Bible to his chest. Technically, he\u2019s not supposed to be there, and the rules say I should call security to remove him before we depart. But as a Christian, I\u2019m taught to show compassion, to care for the vulnerable, and to see Christ in the faces of those in need. My heart aches as I weigh my duty to keep the train running smoothly and the expectation to treat this man with kindness and dignity. The clock ticks, pressure mounting from both my job and my conscience, and I stand frozen, torn between the demands of my profession and the call of my faith."}
