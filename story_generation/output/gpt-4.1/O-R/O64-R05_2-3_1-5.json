The line snakes past the candy racks, customers shifting impatiently, eyes flicking to their watches. I know the store manager expects speed and accuracy, especially now, during the after-work rush. But my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a reminder. In less than an hour, I\u2019m supposed to meet Miriam, the conversion candidate, for her final study session before her Beit Din. She\u2019s anxious, and I promised I\u2019d help her review the laws and prayers one last time. My mind races: if I leave early, the line will grow, my coworkers will be overwhelmed, and mistakes could happen. If I stay, Miriam might feel abandoned, unprepared for a moment that could change her life. I feel the weight of both uniforms\u2014the store apron and the rabbinic kippah\u2014pressing on my shoulders, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait. The register beeps again, and I force a smile, but inside, I\u2019m torn, caught between two worlds that both need me, right now."}
