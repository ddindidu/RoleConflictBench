The familiar scent of incense filled the room, and the gentle hum of my fellow practitioners\u2019 breathing was a balm to my nerves. I closed my eyes, ready to let go of the week\u2019s tension, when the dispatcher\u2019s urgent voice cut through: \u201cArmed robbery in progress, Main and Fifth. Officers respond immediately.\u201d My hand hovered over my badge, heart pounding. As a police officer, I was trained to act\u2014swiftly, decisively, to protect lives and restore order. But as a Buddhist, I was taught to cultivate stillness, to respond with compassion, to be present in the moment. The expectation to leap into action clashed with the call to remain grounded and mindful. My mind raced, torn between the chaos outside and the peace within these walls. The group\u2019s eyes were closed, but I felt exposed, caught between duty and devotion, the weight of both roles pressing down on me as I struggled to decide which call to answer."}
