My phone buzzed with messages from the team: \u201cAny update? We\u2019re blocked until your part is done.\u201d The pressure was mounting\u2014everyone was waiting on me, and the project deadline loomed. I knew the technical solution was within reach if I just pushed through a few more hours. But then, another message appeared, this one from my Buddhist teacher: a gentle reminder about tomorrow\u2019s temple session. I had promised to summarize key teachings, a task that required quiet reflection and careful thought. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014one toward the urgent demands of my engineering team, the other toward the spiritual commitment I had made. I felt my chest tighten, guilt and anxiety swirling together. How could I be present for both? The weight of expectation pressed down, and I sat frozen, unable to move forward, caught between the world of code and the world of contemplation."}
