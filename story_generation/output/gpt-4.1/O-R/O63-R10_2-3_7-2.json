The phone queue was still packed, blinking red with impatient customers. Management had sent another reminder this morning: no unscheduled breaks, every minute accounted for. I felt the pressure in my chest, knowing my supervisor was watching the break logs. But as the minute hand crept closer to noon, my mind drifted to my puja room at home. Noon was sacred, the time for my midday prayers and offerings. I had never missed it, not once. My family and my faith expected this devotion; it was how I honored my ancestors and the divine. Yet here I was, headset pressing into my ear, torn between the demands of my job and the pull of my spiritual duty. My fingers hovered over the break button, heart pounding, as I weighed the consequences\u2014disappointing my manager or breaking my sacred routine. The queue beeped again, and I closed my eyes, caught in the impossible space between two worlds."}
