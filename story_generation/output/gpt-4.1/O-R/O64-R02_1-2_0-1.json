My manager expected me to be precise, to keep the line moving and the till balanced. I glanced at the clock\u20144:45 p.m. The main weekly service at the church started in fifteen minutes, and as the priest, I was supposed to lead the prayers and offer comfort to my congregation. My phone buzzed in my pocket: a reminder from the church secretary, \u201cEveryone\u2019s gathering now.\u201d I looked at the growing line, a mother with a restless toddler, an elderly man counting coins. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the apron and the collar\u2014pressing on my chest. The store needed me to stay, to finish my shift, but my community needed me at the altar. My hands trembled as I handed back change, my mind torn between the beep of the scanner and the echo of hymns waiting to be sung."}
