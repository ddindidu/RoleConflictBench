Thirty minutes of downtime already\u2014every second meant mounting losses. As the machine repairer, I was expected to diagnose the sensor error fast, get the line running, and keep the team calm. I grabbed my toolkit, mind racing through possible causes, when I heard a hesitant knock. It was Maria, her eyes red-rimmed. \u201cPastor, do you have a moment?\u201d she whispered. She needed guidance, her voice trembling with the weight of a life-altering decision. My heart clenched. As her pastor, I was supposed to listen, offer comfort, and help her find clarity. But the production manager\u2019s urgent call echoed from the intercom, demanding my technical expertise. I stood frozen, torn between the whirring machines and Maria\u2019s silent plea, feeling the crushing weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting me to be fully present, fully theirs."}
