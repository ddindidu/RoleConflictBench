My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week.\u201d I dialed the next number, rehearsing my pitch, but my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. \u201cCan you talk? I\u2019m struggling today.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been having a hard time lately, and as her pastor, I felt a deep responsibility to be there for her, to offer comfort and guidance. But if I took the time to call her, I\u2019d lose precious minutes, maybe miss my target, and face another stern talk from my supervisor. My headset felt heavier, my collar tighter. I stared at the phone, torn between the pressure to perform and the call to care, my heart pulled in two directions as the minutes ticked away."}
