My patient sat across from me, sniffling and coughing, her chart open in front of me. The symptoms pointed to a common cold, but as a doctor, I knew I had to be thorough\u2014sometimes, the most innocuous signs hid something more serious. I owed it to her to listen carefully, to ask the right questions, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with a message from the synagogue: they needed one more person for the funeral prayer, the minyan, and the service couldn\u2019t begin without me. As a Jew, I felt the pull of obligation\u2014this was a mitzvah, a sacred duty, especially for the deceased\u2019s family. I could almost hear my father\u2019s voice reminding me of the importance of community and tradition.\n\nMy patient looked at me expectantly, waiting for my diagnosis. My heart pounded as I weighed my responsibilities: the trust she placed in me as her doctor, and the call of my faith and community. I sat there, torn, the seconds ticking by, unsure which role I could bear to let down."}
