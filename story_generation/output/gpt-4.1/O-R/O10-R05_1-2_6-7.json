Among them was a standard payment confirmation from a vendor, the kind that required a prompt, formal reply to keep our business relationships smooth. I knew the expectation: professionalism, timeliness, and attention to detail. As I began drafting my response, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014today was Daniel\u2019s bar mitzvah, a ceremony I had promised to officiate months ago. The family was counting on me to guide their son through this milestone, to offer wisdom and presence. My mind raced. If I delayed the vendor reply, I risked appearing negligent in my accounting duties. If I rushed it, I might make a mistake or seem curt. Yet, if I focused on the email, I\u2019d be late for the bar mitzvah, letting down a family and a community who trusted me as their rabbi. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between two worlds, each demanding my full attention at the very same moment."}
