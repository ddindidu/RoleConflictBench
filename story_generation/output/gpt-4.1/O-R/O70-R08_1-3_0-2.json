My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cDeliver it tonight, no exceptions.\u201d I checked the address; it was across town, and traffic would be heavy. As a delivery person, I knew the expectation\u2014packages must reach customers on time, no matter what. \n\nBut tonight was also the weekly Quran study circle at the mosque. I hadn\u2019t finished reading the verses we\u2019d be discussing, and I felt a knot in my stomach. As a Muslim, I was expected to come prepared, to recite and reflect thoughtfully with my community. The study circle was important to me, a time to reconnect with my faith and friends. \n\nI stared at the package in my hands, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down. If I delivered the package first, I\u2019d miss the study circle or arrive unprepared. If I went to the mosque, the delivery would be late, and I\u2019d let down my team and the customer. My mind raced, torn between duty and devotion, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
