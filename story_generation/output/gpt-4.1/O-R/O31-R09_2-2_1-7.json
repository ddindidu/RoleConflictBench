The crowd\u2019s shouts grew louder, and I could see tempers flaring between the two groups. As a police officer, I was expected to stay, to keep the peace, to be the calm in the chaos. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that tonight was my turn to chant the Torah portion at synagogue. It wasn\u2019t just any service; it was the anniversary of my grandfather\u2019s passing, and my family would be waiting, expecting me to honor our tradition. I felt the weight of my uniform and my yarmulke, tucked away in my bag. The city needed me here, but my community and my family needed me there. My heart pounded as I watched the protest swell, torn between duty to the law and devotion to my faith, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
