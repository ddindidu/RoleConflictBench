This morning, the bride-to-be and her friends arrived early, their faces tense with worry about the tight schedule. I greeted them warmly, ushering them in, determined to ease their nerves and keep everything running smoothly. But as I glanced out the window, I saw the vibrant colors and heard the familiar music of the local Hindu festival. Today was a significant day for my community, and my family expected me to join the rituals, to honor our traditions and celebrate together. My phone buzzed with messages from my mother, reminding me not to miss the puja. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach\u2014my clients needed me here, but my heart ached to be with my family, fulfilling my role as a devoted Hindu. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the salon\u2019s laughter and the distant sounds of celebration."}
