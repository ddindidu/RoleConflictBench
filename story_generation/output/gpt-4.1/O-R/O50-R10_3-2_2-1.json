The nurse\u2019s voice still rang in my ears: \u201cThe ventilator\u2019s failing. We need you now.\u201d My mind raced through possible faults, but another thought tugged at me. It was dusk, the sacred hour when I always paused to light the lamp and offer prayers at my home altar. My family expected me to uphold this daily ritual, a thread connecting me to my faith and ancestors. Yet here I was, torn between the urgent beeping of a life-support machine and the quiet call of devotion. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest\u2014one demanding my technical skill to save a life, the other my spiritual discipline to honor the divine. I stood outside the ICU, toolbox heavy in my grip, heart pounding, caught between the sterile urgency of the hospital and the warm glow of my waiting altar."}
