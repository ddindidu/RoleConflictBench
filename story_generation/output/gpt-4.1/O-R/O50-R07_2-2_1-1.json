The supervisor\u2019s voice crackles through my radio, urgency sharp in every word: \u201cWe need you to find the fault, now. Every minute costs us.\u201d I run diagnostics, hands steady but mind racing. The sensor errors are stubborn, elusive, and the pressure mounts with each passing second. Yet, as the clock ticks closer to evening, my thoughts drift to the temple. Tonight is the memorial service\u2014an important ceremony for our community, and I am expected to help lead the chanting, to be present and centered for those who grieve. My phone vibrates with a gentle reminder from the sangha. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the demand for technical precision and swift action, the call for spiritual presence and compassion. My heart aches with the knowledge that I cannot fully meet both expectations. I stare at the blinking error code, torn between the machine\u2019s silent plea and the quiet pull of the temple bell."}
