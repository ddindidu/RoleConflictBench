As a lawyer, I had just ended a tense phone call with opposing counsel, who was relentless in his pursuit of information I could never ethically reveal. My client\u2019s trust, the very foundation of my profession, was at stake. Yet, as I glanced at my calendar, I saw the reminder for tonight\u2019s planning meeting at the church. As a priest, I was expected to guide and inspire, to be present and attentive as we shaped the next season\u2019s adult faith formation series. The parish counted on me to lead with compassion and wisdom, to nurture their spiritual growth. But my mind was tangled in legal knots, replaying the conversation, worrying about the consequences for my client.

The clock ticked closer to the meeting, and I sat frozen, wrestling with the impossible demands of both vocations, unsure how to honor them both."}
