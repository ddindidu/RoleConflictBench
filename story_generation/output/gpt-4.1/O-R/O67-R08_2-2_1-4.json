My heart raced. I knew every second counted, and my duty as an ambulance driver was clear: get there fast, no matter what. But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the office function scheduled for this afternoon. My colleagues, men and women, would all be there. As a Muslim, I always made sure to dress modestly, covering my arms and legs, even in the heat. Today, though, I was in my standard-issue uniform\u2014short sleeves, practical for driving and lifting patients, but not what I would choose for a mixed gathering.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting. Should I rush to the emergency in my current uniform, knowing I\u2019d have to walk straight into the function afterward, not dressed as I believe I should? Or should I take a moment to change, risking precious minutes for the patient? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I gripped the steering wheel, torn between my responsibilities and my faith."}
