My hands gripped the steering wheel, heart pounding as I prepared to speed through traffic. As an ambulance driver, every second mattered; lives depended on my swift response. But just as I was about to pull out, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a friend from church. She was in tears, stranded nearby after a fight with her husband, desperate for someone to talk to, someone to show her the love and kindness our faith teaches. I could hear her pain in her voice, the kind of pain that can\u2019t wait, the kind that needs a friend right now. My mind raced\u2014my duty to the injured, the expectation to be the hands and feet of Christ to those in need. Both calls were urgent, both lives precious. I sat frozen, torn between the blaring siren and the silent cry for help, wrestling with the impossible weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
