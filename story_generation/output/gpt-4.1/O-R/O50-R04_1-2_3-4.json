The machines had been running hot, and everyone was counting on me to get them cleaned and serviced before production resumed. I knew how much depended on my work\u2014if I missed this window, the whole line could be delayed, costing the company dearly. \n\nBut as I scrolled through my messages, I saw the mosque\u2019s announcement: my name, the topic of my sermon, and the reminder that I was the only imam listed for this Friday. The community had been looking forward to my khutbah, and I knew how much they valued my guidance, especially now. I could already picture the expectant faces, the trust they placed in me to lead them in prayer and reflection.\n\nMy mind raced, torn between the humming machines and the echoing prayer hall. Both roles demanded my presence, both communities relied on me. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, and I wondered how I could possibly choose between them."}
