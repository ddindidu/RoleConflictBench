Moments ago, I had rushed a patient into the emergency room\u2014his symptoms were severe, his breathing labored, and his condition deteriorating fast. As a doctor, I knew I had to stay, to diagnose and act quickly, to save his life. But the call to prayer echoed through the halls, and I remembered it was Friday, the most important congregational prayer of the week. I was expected to join the main prayer hall, to stand shoulder to shoulder with my community, dressed modestly and respectfully as my faith required. Yet here I was, in scrubs and a lab coat, not in the proper attire, torn between my duty to my patient and my obligation to my faith. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, feeling the tension rise within me, uncertain which path to take."}
