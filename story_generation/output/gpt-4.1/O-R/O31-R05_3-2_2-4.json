I glanced at the clock\u2014fifteen minutes until the lesson. The phone buzzed: \u201cArmed robbery in progress, corner of Main and 5th. All units respond.\u201d My badge felt heavy on my chest, a stark reminder of my duty to protect. But in the next room, the children\u2019s voices echoed, waiting for their rabbi to guide them in Torah, to teach them the values of peace and justice. My police training screamed at me to act, to rush to the scene and enforce the law, to save lives. Yet, as a rabbi, I was expected to be present, to nurture young souls, to provide stability and wisdom. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each vital in its own way. My heart pounded as I stood at the threshold, torn between the siren\u2019s call and the sacred duty awaiting me in the classroom."}
