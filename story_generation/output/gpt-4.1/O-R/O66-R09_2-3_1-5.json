He\u2019s anxious, tapping his foot, checking his watch, and I feel the pressure to get him there on time. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to deliver him safely and quickly, but every red light and slow-moving car tightens the knot in my stomach. \n\nLater, at a community event, I\u2019m surrounded by laughter and the aroma of food. Platters are passed around, but none bear the kosher certification I rely on. My friends urge me to join in, not understanding my hesitation. I want to be part of the celebration, to accept their hospitality, but my commitment to kosher laws holds me back. \n\nI feel pulled in two directions\u2014by my duty to my passenger and my faith, by the desire to belong and the need to stay true to my beliefs. The expectations press in from all sides, and I sit, wrestling with what I should do next."}
