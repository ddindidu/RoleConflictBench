Swim lessons were about to start, and I knew the rope had to be fixed immediately\u2014otherwise, the class would be disrupted, and the kids\u2019 safety could be at risk. I grabbed the maintenance kit, but as I knelt by the water, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque committee: the backup imam was still out of town, and everyone was gathering for the midday prayer. They were counting on me to lead, as I had promised when I took on the role. I looked at the broken rope, then at the clock, feeling the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me. The pool echoed with laughter and splashes, while in my mind, I could already hear the quiet anticipation of the congregation. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once, knowing that whichever choice I made, I would be letting someone down."}
