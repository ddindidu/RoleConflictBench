As the senior machine repairer, everyone expected me to lead the routine servicing\u2014cleaning, oiling, and checking every bolt to keep the machines running smoothly. The shutdown was rare, and missing it could mean weeks of breakdowns and complaints. My supervisor had already reminded me twice: \u201cWe need you here, no excuses.\u201d\n\nBut at home, my mother was busy preparing for the family ceremony. Next week was the festival, and as a Hindu, I was expected to be there\u2014on time, dressed in my best, ready to join the prayers and rituals. My father\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cFamily comes first, especially during the festival. Don\u2019t let us down.\u201d\n\nThe two calendars\u2014one at work, one at home\u2014clashed in my mind. I felt the pressure building, torn between the whirring machines that depended on my hands and the sacred traditions that shaped my heart. I sat on my bed, staring at my uniform and my festival clothes, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path I would choose."}
