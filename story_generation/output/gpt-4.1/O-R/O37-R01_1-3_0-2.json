The living room was only half-tidied, and I could already hear the muffled voices of my housemates returning. They expected the place to be spotless, and I knew the dust on the shelves and the crumbs under the table would not go unnoticed. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from Sarah, her words urgent: \u201cCan you talk? I really need guidance. It\u2019s about my marriage.\u201d As a pastor, I knew how much she depended on me, especially now, when her choices could change everything. My heart twisted. I could picture her sitting alone, waiting for comfort and wisdom, while here, the mess around me seemed to grow heavier with every passing minute. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding spotless surfaces, the other a listening ear and a steady heart. I stood in the hallway, mop in one hand, phone in the other, caught between the expectations of cleanliness and compassion, unsure which need was greater."}
