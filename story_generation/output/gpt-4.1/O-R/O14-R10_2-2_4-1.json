My laptop screen glowed with half-finished graphs and raw data, demanding my attention. As a scientist, I knew the importance of accuracy\u2014my colleagues expected a clear, honest summary of my findings, even if the results were still inconclusive. The pressure to meet their standards pressed on my shoulders.\n\nBut as the sun dipped lower, a different pull tugged at me. My family\u2019s voices echoed from the living room, reminding me it was time for evening prayers. As a Hindu, lighting the lamp and offering prayers at our home altar was not just a ritual\u2014it was a promise to my faith and my ancestors. My mother\u2019s gentle reminder floated in from the hallway, and guilt pricked at me for even considering skipping the ritual.\n\nI stared at my data, then at the small brass lamp waiting in the next room. The expectations of my profession and my faith collided within me, each demanding my presence, each refusing to yield. My heart pounded as I sat frozen, torn between the world of science and the sanctuary of my beliefs."}
