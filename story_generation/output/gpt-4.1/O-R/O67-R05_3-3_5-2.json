Dispatch had said it was a major heart attack\u2014every second mattered. As an ambulance driver, I knew my duty: reach the patient, provide care, and get them to the hospital alive. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart pounded for another reason. Tonight was the High Holiday service, and as the rabbi, I was expected to deliver a sermon that would guide and inspire my entire congregation. They had gathered, waiting for my words, trusting me to lead them through this sacred night. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanded my presence at a bedside, the other at the pulpit. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me, knowing that no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down. The ambulance turned the final corner, and I gripped the wheel tighter, caught between the call of duty and the call of faith, unsure which path I would take."}
