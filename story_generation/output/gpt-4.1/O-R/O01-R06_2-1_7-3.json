The contractor had called late last night\u2014unexpected delays meant we needed an urgent site meeting this morning to keep the project on track. As the architect, I knew my presence was crucial; missing this meeting could set us back days, maybe weeks, and I\u2019d be letting down my team and the client who trusted me to manage everything efficiently.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I realized the meeting would overlap with Sunday worship. My church community expected me to be there, not just to worship but to support others, to be present in faith and fellowship. I\u2019d missed the last two Sundays already, and guilt gnawed at me. I longed for the peace and grounding that came from those services, the sense of belonging and purpose. Yet, the weight of professional responsibility pressed just as heavily on my shoulders.\n\nI sat at my desk, torn between the demands of my work and the call of my faith, heart pounding as I tried to decide where I truly belonged this morning."}
