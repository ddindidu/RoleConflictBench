My client\u2019s future\u2014and a substantial sum\u2014rested on my ability to represent them without distraction. The judge had made it clear: no delays, no excuses. Yet, as I glanced at my phone, a reminder flashed for Sunday\u2019s church service. My pastor had called just last night, gently reminding me of my commitment to the congregation, especially since I\u2019d missed the last two services. The church community counted on me, not just for worship, but for the support and fellowship I provided. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing against the unyielding demands of the courtroom. My heart ached with guilt at the thought of letting down my church family, but my mind raced with the legal strategies I needed to focus on. I sat in my office, torn between the sacred duty to my faith and the professional oath I\u2019d sworn, feeling the two worlds pulling me apart as the clock ticked closer to the trial\u2019s start."}
