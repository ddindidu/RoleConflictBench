The supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cAlways wear gloves, mask, and follow every hygiene step\u2014no shortcuts.\u201d I know how important it is, especially after last week\u2019s inspection. Today, as I finish cleaning the lobby, I glance at the clock. It\u2019s almost time for my daily puja. As a Hindu, lighting the lamp and offering prayers at my home altar is sacred\u2014a moment to connect with the divine and seek blessings for my family.\n\nBut my hands are still covered in the scent of disinfectant, and I haven\u2019t had a chance to shower. The protocols are clear: I must not bring outside germs into my home, especially near the altar. Yet, the thought of skipping my ritual fills me with guilt and unease. My mother always said, \u201cThe lamp must be lit before noon.\u201d I stand at the threshold, torn between the duty to keep my home safe and the devotion that anchors my spirit. My heart pounds as I wrestle with what to do next."}
