The production outage was traced back to a bug in my code, and now hundreds of customers couldn\u2019t access the service. My phone buzzed with urgent Slack messages\u2014everyone was counting on me to fix this, and fast. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized I had only an hour left before I needed to leave for church. Sunday service was tonight, and I was supposed to deliver a sermon on making wise, ethical choices under pressure. The congregation expected guidance, reassurance, and a message that would help them through their own struggles. I could picture the faces of people who would be waiting for me, needing hope and direction. My laptop screen glowed with lines of broken code, while my Bible and notes sat open on the desk beside me. I felt torn in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing, caught between the urgent needs of my job and the spiritual needs of my flock."}
