My phone buzzed\u2014a homeowner\u2019s voice, anxious, told me their deck was splintered and unsafe. I promised to come, picturing the warped boards and the tools I\u2019d need. But as I gathered my things, Sister Agnes appeared at the door, her eyes bright with news: I\u2019d been chosen to lead tonight\u2019s prayer vigil, a rare honor for our convent. The sisters expected me to guide them, to be present in spirit and voice, representing our faith before hundreds. My heart pounded. The deck needed urgent repair; the family relied on me for safety. Yet my sisters and the community looked to me for spiritual leadership. I felt torn, the weight of my hammer in one hand, my rosary in the other, caught between the call to serve with my hands and the call to serve with my soul."}
