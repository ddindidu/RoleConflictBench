She\u2019s early for her appointment, and the receptionist is idly scrolling through her phone. I know I should greet Mrs. Lin, offer her tea, and make her feel at home\u2014she\u2019s been coming here for years, and it\u2019s part of my job to make every client feel special. But my mind is elsewhere. The monastery\u2019s annual festival starts today, and I promised the sangha I\u2019d help with the dawn preparations. It\u2019s the one time each year when the whole community comes together, and my absence would be noticed. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the expectation to be present and attentive here, and the call to serve and participate in the rituals that ground my spiritual life. My hands tremble slightly as I reach for the kettle, torn between the comfort of routine and the pull of devotion, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
