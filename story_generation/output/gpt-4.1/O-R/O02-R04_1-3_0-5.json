As an engineer, I was expected to propose innovative solutions, but the project was still in its early stages\u2014there was time to explore alternatives later. Yet, my phone buzzed with reminders from the mosque committee: this Friday\u2019s sermon was special. Our community was celebrating a milestone, and people were coming from distant towns just to hear me speak. The weight of their expectations pressed on me; they wanted inspiration, guidance, a sense of unity. At the same time, my manager expected me to join a last-minute brainstorming session that could shape the project\u2019s direction. Both roles demanded my presence, my focus, my best self. I felt torn, anxiety tightening in my chest. Could I let down my colleagues by stepping away, or disappoint my community by not being there for them? The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice between my two worlds."}
