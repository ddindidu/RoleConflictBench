My supervisor had just reminded me that the main prayer hall needed a deep clean before the Friday congregational worship. Every corner had to be spotless, every surface sanitized. I glanced down at my uniform\u2014short sleeves and fitted pants, the standard housekeeping attire. But as a Muslim, I knew I was about to enter the sacred space for Jumu\u2019ah, where modest dress was not just expected, but required. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands: the urgency to clean thoroughly, as my job required, and the obligation to honor my faith by dressing modestly in the prayer hall. I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my supervisor\u2019s expectations and my own religious convictions. I hesitated at the threshold, torn between the two worlds, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
