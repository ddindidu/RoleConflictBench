As an architect, I was expected to keep everything on track, to ensure that every detail was accounted for and that nothing slipped through the cracks. I glanced at my phone, checking messages from contractors, making mental notes about which tasks needed follow-up. My review was casual, but I knew the team relied on me to keep things moving smoothly.\n\nJust then, the church door creaked open. I looked up to see a woman, her face streaked with tears, clutching her coat tightly. She barely managed to whisper, \u201cFather, I need help. Please.\u201d The expectation as a priest was clear: I was to offer comfort, to listen, to be present for those in pain. But my mind was still tangled in construction schedules and looming deadlines. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding efficiency and order, the other requiring compassion and undivided attention. My heart pounded as I stood, torn between the blueprints on my desk and the broken soul before me, uncertain which role to answer first."}
