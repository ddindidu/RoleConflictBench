As a lifeguard, I knew the rules: never look away, never let your guard down. Suddenly, I noticed a swimmer in the middle of the pool, their strokes growing frantic. My muscles tensed, ready to leap in if needed. Just then, a young woman approached the lifeguard chair, tears streaming down her face. She whispered, \u201cPlease, I need someone to talk to. I\u2019m really struggling.\u201d Her voice trembled with desperation, and I felt the weight of my faith pressing on me\u2014Jesus taught us to love, to comfort those in pain. But my duty as a lifeguard demanded my full attention on the water. If I turned away, even for a moment, someone could drown. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice: to offer compassion and comfort, or to keep my eyes fixed on the pool, protecting every life in it."}
