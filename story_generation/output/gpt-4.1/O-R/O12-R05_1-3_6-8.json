The issue wasn\u2019t critical\u2014users could refresh and move on\u2014but QA was pressing for a fix before the next release. I glanced at the clock, calculating how long it might take to patch the code and run tests. Then another message came through, this one from the synagogue president: a beloved congregant had passed away, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral as soon as possible. My heart clenched. I knew how much comfort my presence and words could bring in their grief. But my team was counting on me, too; the release schedule was tight, and I\u2019d already promised to handle this bug. I stared at my screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding my technical focus, the other my spiritual presence. I could almost hear the voices: my manager\u2019s urgency, the mourners\u2019 need. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between duty and compassion, as I tried to decide which call to answer first."}
