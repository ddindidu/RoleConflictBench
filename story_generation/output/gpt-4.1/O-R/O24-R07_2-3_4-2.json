The parties await my words\u2014clear, detailed, and just. Every sentence must be weighed, every fact considered, every conclusion precise. The responsibility presses on me; justice cannot be rushed or neglected.\n\nYet, as I glance at my phone, a message from the monastery appears: the annual festival begins at dawn. They need volunteers\u2014hands to prepare offerings, voices to chant, hearts to serve. This is not just a ritual; it is the heart of our community, a time when I am expected to be present, to embody compassion and selflessness.\n\nMy mind tugs in two directions. The law demands my focus, my intellect, my impartiality. The sangha calls for my presence, my humility, my devotion. I feel the tension in my chest, the ache of wanting to fulfill both duties, knowing that time and energy are finite. I close my eyes, searching for clarity, but the conflict only sharpens, unresolved."}
