The autoclave\u2019s pressure gauge had been acting up, and the fume hood\u2019s airflow was just below the recommended threshold. I knew I needed to recalibrate and document everything before the inspectors arrived. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from Mrs. Evans, who mentioned that her husband hadn\u2019t left the house in days and seemed withdrawn. As their pastor, I felt a deep responsibility to reach out, to offer comfort and a listening ear. But the lab demanded my attention; any oversight could risk not only the audit but the safety of my colleagues. I stood in the sterile, humming quiet of the lab, torn between the urgent needs of my scientific duties and the quiet, persistent call to care for someone in pain. My heart ached with the weight of both roles, each expecting my full presence, each unwilling to wait."}
