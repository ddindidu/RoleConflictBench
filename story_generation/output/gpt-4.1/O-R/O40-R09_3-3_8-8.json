The damage was worse than I\u2019d feared, and she looked at me with pleading eyes, desperate for a plan to keep her home safe. As a carpenter, I knew I had to act fast\u2014if I didn\u2019t start repairs today, the structure might not last another week. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was David from the synagogue. \u201cWe need one more for the minyan,\u201d he said, his voice urgent. \u201cIt\u2019s for a funeral prayer. Can you come now?\u201d I felt my heart twist. The community needed me to help honor the dead, to fulfill a sacred duty. But Mrs. Goldstein needed me too, right here, right now. I could see the expectation in her face, the trust that I would fix what was broken. My hands, skilled with wood, suddenly felt heavy with the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. I stood there, torn, the clock ticking louder in my mind, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
