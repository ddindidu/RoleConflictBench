My hands move quickly, but my mind is elsewhere\u2014tonight is the weekly group meditation, the one hour I dedicate to stillness and mindfulness. I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss it again. But now, a customer slams her groceries on the belt, her voice sharp and frustrated about a coupon that won\u2019t scan. I force a smile, recalling the store\u2019s expectation: always be friendly, always be patient, no matter what. My heart pounds as I glance at the clock; the meditation group will start soon. I feel the tension between my roles\u2014one demands I stay calm and present for others, the other asks me to be calm and present for myself. The stress tightens in my chest as I try to soothe the customer, my mind torn between the chaos of the store and the peace waiting for me elsewhere."}
