My client\u2019s case was hanging by a thread, and I knew how much they depended on my preparation and presence. Yet, as I highlighted key arguments, my phone buzzed with reminders about the High Holiday service. As the rabbi, I was expected to deliver a sermon that would inspire and guide the entire congregation\u2014especially on this sacred day. The community looked to me for spiritual leadership, and missing the service would be unthinkable. My mind raced, torn between the courtroom and the bimah, between my duty to advocate and my calling to shepherd. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to yield. I felt the tension coil in my chest, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be let down."}
