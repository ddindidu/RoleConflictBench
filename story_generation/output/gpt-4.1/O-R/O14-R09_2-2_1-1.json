The experiment was crucial\u2014months of preparation, grant money on the line, and my team counting on me to gather the data. But as I scrolled through my calendar, my heart sank. The slot overlapped with the days leading up to Shavuot. My children were waiting for me at home, their eager faces expecting stories of Ruth and lessons on the Ten Commandments. I had promised to teach them the blessings, to bake challah together, to pass on the traditions my parents gave me. My colleagues expected precision and dedication; my family expected presence and guidance. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the sterile hum of the lab echoing in my mind as I pictured my children\u2019s hopeful eyes. I sat at my desk, torn, the demands of science and faith pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which part of myself I would have to disappoint."}
