The pre-shift briefing is about to begin, and as a subway operator, I know how crucial it is to absorb every detail\u2014passenger safety depends on it. Yet, my phone vibrates with a gentle reminder: the weekly group meditation starts in ten minutes, and I am the leader. My Buddhist sangha expects me to guide them in mindfulness, to be present and calm, to embody the teachings I hold dear. The two worlds pull at me\u2014one demanding unwavering attention to rules and schedules, the other calling for stillness and presence. My heart pounds with the weight of responsibility, torn between the clamor of the subway and the quiet of the meditation hall. I close my eyes for a moment, feeling the tension coil inside me, knowing I cannot be in both places at once."}
