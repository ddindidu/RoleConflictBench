The deadline for the online assessment was tonight, and I still had modules to complete. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mrs. Ramirez, reminding me about the final preparation session for her son\u2019s sacrament tomorrow. She sounded anxious; this was the last chance before the ceremony, and the family was counting on me to guide them through this important milestone.\n\nAs a pharmacist, I knew how crucial it was to stay current, not just for my license, but for the safety of my patients. Yet, as a priest, I felt the weight of the community\u2019s trust, especially during such a meaningful time for this family. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent, and both were non-negotiable. My mind raced, torn between professional responsibility and spiritual duty, feeling the pressure of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
