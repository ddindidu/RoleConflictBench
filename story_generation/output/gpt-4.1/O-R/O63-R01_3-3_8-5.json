Every call, every break, every moment was tracked. The compliance system was merciless\u2014one unscheduled minute, and I\u2019d be flagged. My supervisor\u2019s warnings echoed in my mind: \u201cStick to your schedule, or there will be consequences.\u201d But then my phone buzzed with a message from the church secretary. A family in our congregation had just lost their home in a fire. They needed me\u2014now. As their pastor, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and guidance in their darkest hour. My heart ached, torn between the rigid demands of my job and the urgent needs of my community. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The clock kept ticking, and I felt myself caught in a tightening vise, unsure which duty to answer first."}
