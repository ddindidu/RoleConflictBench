My team looks to me, hopeful, knowing this experiment could make or break our research before the funding review. I feel the weight of their expectations, the urgency to seize this fleeting opportunity. Yet, my phone vibrates with a gentle reminder: the weekly meditation session begins in thirty minutes. As the group leader, I am expected to guide everyone in mindfulness, to embody calm and presence. I picture the circle of practitioners, waiting for me to ring the bell, to help them find stillness. My mind races, torn between the pressing demands of science and the quiet call of my spiritual practice. I feel my breath catch, anxiety rising as I stand at the crossroads of duty and devotion, knowing I cannot be in both places at once."}
