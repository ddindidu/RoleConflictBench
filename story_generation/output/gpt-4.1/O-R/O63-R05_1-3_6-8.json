The office was unusually quiet, and my supervisor had just announced we could take our breaks whenever we wanted today. I felt a rare sense of freedom, a chance to step away from the endless pitches and polite rejections. Just as I was about to log out for a break, my phone buzzed with a message from the synagogue board: a beloved congregant had passed away, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral as soon as possible. My heart tightened. As a rabbi, I knew how much comfort my presence could bring in their grief, and I felt the weight of their expectation. But as a telemarketer, I was still on the clock, and leaving abruptly\u2014even with flexible breaks\u2014could jeopardize my standing at work. I sat frozen, torn between the quiet hum of the call center and the urgent call of my community, feeling the pressure of both worlds pressing in on me."}
