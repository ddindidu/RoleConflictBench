The phone rings, and I launch into my pitch, but the prospect interrupts with a barrage of technical questions. My manager expects me to handle objections smoothly, to keep the call on track, but the script only scratches the surface. I fumble for answers, feeling the pressure to sound confident and knowledgeable. \n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzes with a reminder: it\u2019s almost time for my weekly study session with my kids. I promised to teach them about Shabbat traditions tonight, to pass on the stories and values that shaped me. I know I could shift the lesson to another evening, but I feel the weight of that promise. My job demands my focus now, but my heart aches at the thought of letting my children down, of missing another chance to share our heritage. The expectations pull me in opposite directions, and I sit frozen, torn between the demands of my work and the commitments of my faith and family."}
