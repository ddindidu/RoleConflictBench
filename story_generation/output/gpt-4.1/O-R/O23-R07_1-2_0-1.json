As a lawyer, I know my client expects a thorough review, even if the deadline is weeks away. They trust me to catch every detail, to protect their interests. Yet, tonight is the community memorial service at the temple\u2014a gathering that only happens once a year. As a Buddhist, I am expected to be present, to support others in their grief, to chant and meditate with the sangha. The thought of missing it fills me with guilt; these rituals are not just tradition, but a way to cultivate compassion and connection. My phone buzzes with a reminder from the temple, while my email pings with a follow-up from the client. I feel pulled in two directions, the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest. I close my eyes, searching for clarity, but the expectations of both worlds swirl inside me, unresolved."}
