A sudden route closure had forced dozens of flights into tight holding stacks around the airport, and every second counted. As an air traffic controller, I was expected to manage the chaos, keep the skies safe, and prevent disaster.

As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, offer comfort, and be present for everyone who looked to me for spiritual guidance. The clock ticked closer to the service time. My phone buzzed with messages from parishioners, asking if I would be there. My hands trembled as I issued instructions to pilots, my mind torn between the lives in the sky and the souls in the pews. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, each demanding all of me, each unwilling to wait."}
