As an architect, I knew the importance of precision\u2014every detail mattered for safety and compliance. Today, I noticed a few minor inconsistencies in the building plan. They weren\u2019t likely to cause immediate problems, but my professional conscience nagged at me. I should double-check, maybe even stay late to revise the plans. \n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the family ceremony for the festival was tonight. As a Hindu, my presence was expected. My parents had called twice already, reminding me to arrive on time, dressed in traditional attire. The thought of disappointing them, of missing the rituals and the warmth of family, weighed heavily on me. \n\nI glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I stayed to fix the plans, I\u2019d be late for the ceremony. If I left now, I\u2019d carry the guilt of neglecting my professional duty. My mind raced, torn between the demands of my work and my faith, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
