I was elbow-deep in the main production unit, sweat beading on my brow as I traced the source of the sensor errors that had halted the line for half an hour. The plant manager hovered nearby, his voice tight with urgency\u2014every minute of downtime cost the company dearly, and I was the only one who could get things running again. As I reached for a replacement part, my phone buzzed again. This time, it was the synagogue president. \u201cRabbi, I\u2019m so sorry to tell you\u2014Mrs. Feldman just passed.
