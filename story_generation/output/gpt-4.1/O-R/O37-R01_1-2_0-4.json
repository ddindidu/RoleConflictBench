The supervisor had mentioned yesterday that the board would be visiting, and I knew they expected the place to be spotless. As I moved to sweep the floor, Mrs. Carter appeared in the doorway, her eyes red and voice trembling. She asked if I had a moment, her words heavy with the weight of something she couldn\u2019t carry alone. As a pastor, I knew I should sit with her, listen, and offer comfort\u2014she needed more than a quick word. But the clock was ticking, and the checklist in my pocket felt heavier with every passing minute. If I stopped now, the cleaning wouldn\u2019t be finished in time, and I\u2019d let down the team. If I kept cleaning, I\u2019d be turning my back on someone who needed me. My heart pounded as I stood there, mop in hand, torn between the demands of my two worlds."}
