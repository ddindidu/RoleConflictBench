She hesitated, then quietly said the tone wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d hoped for. My heart raced\u2014I knew I needed to listen, reassure her, and fix it if possible. At the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message about Mrs. Evans, a member of my congregation, who\u2019d been feeling low lately. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d check in on her today, offer a few comforting words, maybe even a prayer. But now, my client needed my full attention. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the expectation to be a professional, attentive hairdresser, and the call to be a caring, present pastor. I could feel my chest tighten as I tried to decide which need was more urgent, torn between the woman in my chair and the one waiting for a sign that someone cared."}
