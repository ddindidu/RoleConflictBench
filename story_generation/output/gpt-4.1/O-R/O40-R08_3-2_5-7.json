Tomorrow, I was to begin the biggest project of my career\u2014custom cabinetry for a new hotel. The plans were complex, demanding my full attention and skill. My boss expected perfection, and I knew a single mistake could cost me my reputation. Yet, as I traced the lines on the paper, my mind wandered to Mecca. My friends were preparing for Hajj, their excitement filling our conversations for weeks. I had saved for years, setting aside every spare coin, and now the opportunity was here. My family and community expected me to fulfill this pillar of my faith, to join them in this sacred journey. But the project\u2019s timing was immovable, and my absence would mean letting down my team and risking my livelihood. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, each demanding my presence, each pulling me in opposite directions. I stared at the blueprints, heart pounding, torn between duty to my craft and devotion to my faith, unsure which path I could bear to leave behind."}
