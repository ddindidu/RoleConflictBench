As a delivery person, my job was simple: make sure every parcel reached its owner, safe and sound. Today, though, the doorbell echoed into emptiness. I glanced at the porch, wondering if leaving the box there would be enough. My supervisor\u2019s words rang in my ears\u2014no lost packages, no excuses. I needed this job; every paycheck mattered.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to something bigger. My savings, carefully set aside for years, were finally enough for Hajj. My friends were booking their flights, sharing plans and prayers. As a Muslim, this was my chance, maybe my only one, to fulfill a lifelong obligation. But what if something happened to the package? If I lost my job, the money for Hajj would vanish with it. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing on my chest\u2014one demanding duty to my work, the other calling me to my faith. I stood on the porch, package in hand, heart pounding, caught between what I must do and what I longed to do."}
