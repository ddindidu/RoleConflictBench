She smiled, \u201cNo need to wash my hair today, I just did it at home.\u201d Her hair was soft and clean, but our salon policy\u2014and my own sense of professionalism\u2014said every client should have their hair washed before a cut. I glanced at the clock. In less than an hour, I was supposed to be at the mosque, delivering the Friday sermon. But today, we had a guest speaker ready to step in if I couldn\u2019t make it. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cKhutbah at 1:30.\u201d I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. As a hairdresser, I wanted to respect Mrs. Rahman\u2019s wishes and save her time, but I also worried about breaking protocol. As an imam, I knew the congregation expected me to be there, but the guest speaker was prepared. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my clients and my community, feeling the tension of wanting to do right by both."}
