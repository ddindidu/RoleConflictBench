As a police officer, staying fit isn\u2019t just a personal goal\u2014it\u2019s a duty. My captain always says, \u201cA strong body means a sharp mind on the streets.\u201d I was halfway out the door when my phone buzzed. It was Mrs. Ramirez, her voice trembling. \u201cFather, we need you tonight. The final preparation for Mateo\u2019s sacrament\u2014please, it\u2019s the only time we can all be together before Sunday.\u201d I glanced at my gym bag, then at the stack of lesson plans on my desk. As a priest, I\u2019m expected to guide families through these sacred moments, to be present, patient, and prepared. But as an officer, I can\u2019t neglect my health; my fitness is a promise to the community I protect. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my best. I stood in the hallway, keys in one hand, Bible in the other, heart pounding with the impossible choice."}
