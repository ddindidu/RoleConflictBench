The quarterly filing deadline looms, and as the company\u2019s accountant, I know every figure must be exact, every regulation followed. My supervisor expects nothing less than flawless compliance, and I feel the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders. Yet, my phone vibrates with a gentle reminder: tonight is the community memorial service at the temple. As a practicing Buddhist, I am expected to attend, to chant and offer support to grieving families. The temple elders and my fellow practitioners will notice my absence, and I feel a deep sense of duty to be present, to honor the teachings of compassion and community. My mind tugs in two directions\u2014one toward the silent office, the other toward the candlelit hall of the temple. I close my eyes, feeling the tension knot in my chest, torn between the demands of my profession and the call of my spiritual community."}
