The house creaked with every step, and Mrs. Johnson\u2019s anxious eyes followed me as she asked, \u201cHow soon can you fix it? We\u2019re scared to sleep upstairs.\u201d I knew the urgency\u2014this wasn\u2019t just a repair, it was their safety. My mind raced with measurements, supply lists, and the hours I\u2019d need to clear my schedule.\n\nAs I was jotting down notes, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mark, a parishioner. \u201cHi, Father. I\u2019ve been struggling lately. Could we talk sometime soon?\u201d His words were vague, but I sensed the weight behind them. As a priest, I\u2019m expected to be present, to listen, to offer comfort whenever it\u2019s needed. I could almost hear the unspoken plea in his message.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting\u2014two people, two urgent needs, both looking to me for help. My hands, skilled with wood and words, trembled slightly as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, how to mend both broken beams and broken spirits."}
