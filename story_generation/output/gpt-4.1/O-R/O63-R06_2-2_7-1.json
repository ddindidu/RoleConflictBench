As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to take my scheduled breaks, but management watches our logs like hawks, frowning at anyone who steps away for even a minute outside the allotted time. Today, my break is scheduled for 2:00 PM, but at 1:58, a call comes through. The name on the screen is familiar\u2014a woman I spoke to last week, who sounded lonely and desperate, more interested in conversation than the product I was selling. \n\nAs a Christian, I believe in compassion and kindness, in being present for those who need it. I know she might need someone to talk to, even if it\u2019s just for a few minutes. But if I take the call, I\u2019ll miss my break and risk a warning from my supervisor. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll be following the rules, but turning away from someone who might need comfort. My heart pounds as I stare at the blinking light, torn between the demands of my job and the values I hold dear."}
