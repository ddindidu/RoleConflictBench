My phone buzzed with messages from site managers\u2014another delay, another conflict to resolve. As the lead architect, everyone looked to me to keep the project on track, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing on my shoulders. Just as I was about to call a contractor, my phone rang again. It was the mosque committee. The regular backup imam was out of town, and the congregation was gathering, waiting for me to lead the prayer. I glanced at the time; the prayer was scheduled to begin in fifteen minutes. My mind raced. If I left now, the project might slip further behind, risking penalties and my team\u2019s trust. If I stayed, the community would be disappointed, and I would feel I had failed in my spiritual duty. My heart pounded as I stood between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
