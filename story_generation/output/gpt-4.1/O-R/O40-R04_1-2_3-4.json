My phone buzzed\u2014a message from the mosque committee, reminding me that I was the sole speaker for tomorrow\u2019s Friday sermon. The topic, \u201cPatience in Times of Trial,\u201d had already been announced to the congregation. I glanced at the half-finished order form on my workbench. The client needed the bookshelf by next week, and I still had to estimate the materials and place the order before the supplier\u2019s noon deadline. My mind raced with the expectations: as a carpenter, I was relied upon for precision and timeliness; as an imam, I was entrusted with spiritual guidance and the community\u2019s respect. The weight of both roles pressed on me. If I focused on the sermon, I might miss the supplier\u2019s window and delay the project, disappointing my client. If I prioritized the order, I risked delivering a rushed, uninspired khutbah. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the demands of my hands and the needs of my soul."}
