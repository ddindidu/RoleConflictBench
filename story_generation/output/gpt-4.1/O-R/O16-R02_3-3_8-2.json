The ER was buzzing with urgency\u2014a young woman had just been rushed in, her infection spreading rapidly. As her doctor, I knew she needed immediate, aggressive antibiotics. Every minute counted. But my phone vibrated in my pocket, a reminder of the most significant religious holiday of the year. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers and rituals, to be present for hundreds who had gathered, waiting for my guidance and blessing. I could almost hear the hymns starting, the congregation\u2019s voices rising in anticipation. My heart pounded with the knowledge that both roles demanded my presence, my expertise, my care. I felt torn, the expectations of healer and spiritual leader pulling me in opposite directions. I stared at the patient\u2019s chart, then at the clock, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
