As a nursing assistant, I knew my place was by her side, offering comfort and a listening ear after her devastating diagnosis. She had no family nearby, and I was often the one she confided in. But as I glanced at my watch, anxiety twisted in my chest. It was nearly time for the Friday prayer, and as the imam, I was expected to deliver the sermon. The community had been looking forward to my talk, and I was the only one scheduled. I imagined the congregation gathering, waiting for words of guidance and hope. My mind raced between the hospital room and the mosque, between the tearful patient who needed me now and the community that counted on my presence. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. I lingered in the hallway, torn, feeling the pull of duty from two worlds that suddenly seemed impossibly far apart."}
