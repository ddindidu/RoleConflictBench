My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the passenger who\u2019d booked me through the app, asking if I could get there any faster. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on being prompt and professional, but traffic was crawling, and my hands tightened on the wheel. At the same time, my mind replayed the conversation from the community gathering earlier that evening. Someone had asked about forgiveness, and I\u2019d shared a story from scripture, hoping to offer comfort and guidance as a pastor. Now, I wondered if I\u2019d said enough, or if I\u2019d missed a chance to truly connect. The demands of both roles pressed in on me: the expectation to deliver swift, reliable service, and the responsibility to teach and embody the principles I preached. My heart raced as I weighed which duty should take precedence, feeling torn between the urgent needs of my passenger and the deeper, ongoing needs of my congregation."}
