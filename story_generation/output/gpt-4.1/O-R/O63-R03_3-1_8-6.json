I was supposed to return to my headset, ready to dial the next number, my every minute tracked by the compliance system. Any unscheduled pause, even for a moment, would be flagged, and I\u2019d have to explain myself to my supervisor. But today, the convent was unusually quiet. The other sisters were out, and I had planned this rare afternoon for spiritual reading and silent reflection\u2014a time I cherished, a time I felt closest to my calling as a nun.\n\nYet, as I sat with my Bible open, the headset on my desk seemed to glare at me, a reminder of the world\u2019s demands. My heart ached for the peace of prayer, but my mind buzzed with anxiety about the system\u2019s watchful eye. I could not ignore the pressure to perform at work, nor could I dismiss the longing for spiritual nourishment. The two worlds pulled at me, each insistent, each righteous in its own way. I closed my eyes, torn, the silence of the convent now filled with the noise of my inner struggle."}
