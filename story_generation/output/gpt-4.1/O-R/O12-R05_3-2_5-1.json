The architects from the payments and analytics teams were waiting for my input on the new API endpoints, and the launch date had just been moved up. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need your decisions today, or the other teams can\u2019t move forward.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting, knowing how many people were depending on me to keep the project on track.\n\nBut as I glanced at my calendar, I saw the reminder for Shabbat. I was expected to prepare a meaningful sermon, something that would resonate with the congregation and offer comfort and guidance. The service was only a day away, and I hadn\u2019t even chosen a topic. My community counted on me to be present, thoughtful, and spiritually prepared.\n\nMy mind raced between code reviews and Torah commentaries, between technical diagrams and ancient texts. I felt pulled in two directions, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. The weight of responsibility pressed down on me, and I wondered how I could possibly meet the expectations of both worlds."}
