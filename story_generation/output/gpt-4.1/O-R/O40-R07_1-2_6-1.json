She explained how her grandson\u2019s favorite train had broken, and she needed it fixed before his birthday tomorrow. I examined the toy, calculating the time and materials needed, and promised her a repair quote by evening. As she left, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the temple. Tonight was the annual memorial service, a ceremony I had helped organize for weeks. The abbot had asked me to arrive early to help set up the altar and greet the families. My heart tightened. As a carpenter, I felt responsible for restoring the toy, knowing how much it meant to the child. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be present, to support my community in honoring their loved ones. Both roles called for my full attention, both felt urgent, and I could already sense the disappointment I might cause, no matter which path I chose. I stood in my workshop, the toy in my hands, torn between the quiet duty of repair and the collective ritual of remembrance."}
