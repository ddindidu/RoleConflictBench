My headset felt heavy after hours of calls, and I knew management was watching\u2014every minute away from the phone was scrutinized, especially with the queue never letting up. I was supposed to log out exactly on time, not a minute early or late. Just as I was about to click out, my phone buzzed with a message from a church member. She was in tears, facing a decision that could change her life, and she needed me\u2014her pastor\u2014to listen and offer guidance. My heart ached for her, but my mind raced with worry. If I took the call, I\u2019d risk being flagged for an unscheduled break, maybe even a warning. If I waited, I\u2019d be letting her down when she needed me most. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to put them first. I sat frozen, torn between the rules of my job and the call of my calling, unsure which voice to answer."}
