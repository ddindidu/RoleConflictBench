The new appellate decision could shift the entire direction of the case, and as a judge, I knew I had to read and analyze it before tomorrow\u2019s session. The law demanded my diligence; justice depended on my preparation. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the adult education class at the synagogue. People would be gathering soon, expecting me, their rabbi, to guide them through the week\u2019s Torah portion, to answer their questions, to be present in their learning. I felt the weight of both robes\u2014the black of the courtroom, the white of the synagogue\u2014pressing on my shoulders. If I stayed to study the case, I\u2019d let down my community. If I went to teach, I\u2019d risk being unprepared in court. My mind raced, torn between the demands of law and faith, between the pursuit of justice and the call to teach. I stared at the clock, heart pounding, knowing I had to choose, but not yet knowing which role would win."}
