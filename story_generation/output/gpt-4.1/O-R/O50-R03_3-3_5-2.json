I knew what it meant\u2014if I didn\u2019t act now, the whole line could grind to a halt, costing the company thousands and putting my coworkers\u2019 jobs at risk. My tool bag was already open, gloves on, but my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. It was the mayor, his voice tight with worry: \u201cSister, we need you. The hurricane\u2019s left so many without homes. Can you help organize the relief center?\u201d \n\nI could picture the faces of the families huddled in the church basement, waiting for food and comfort, and I felt the weight of my habit pressing on my shoulders. My supervisor\u2019s words from this morning rang in my ears\u2014\u201cWe can\u2019t afford any downtime today\u201d\u2014while the mayor\u2019s plea tugged at my heart.
