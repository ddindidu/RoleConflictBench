The safety audit is in two days, and I know the centrifuge still rattles, the fume hood\u2019s filter is overdue for replacement. My supervisor expects perfection\u2014no excuses, not even minor ones. I\u2019m the one responsible for this lab, and if anything goes wrong, it\u2019s on me. But as I reach for the maintenance log, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a reminder: \u201cBar mitzvah practice, 6:00 PM.\u201d My son\u2019s big day is coming, and he\u2019s still stumbling over the Torah portion. My wife and rabbi both say he needs me\u2014my guidance, my patience, my voice beside his as he learns. I promised I\u2019d help him tonight. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. The lab\u2019s silent alarms, the sacred words waiting at home. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and both demand all of me. My hands tremble as I try to decide which responsibility I\u2019ll let down."}
