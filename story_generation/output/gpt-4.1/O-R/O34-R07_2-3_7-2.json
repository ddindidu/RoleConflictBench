My headset crackled with voices\u2014colleagues in adjacent sectors, pilots anxious for guidance, the whole system straining under the pressure. I was supposed to coordinate handoffs, keep the airspace flowing, prevent chaos. Every second, a new decision, a new responsibility. Yet, in the back of my mind, the monastery bell tolled. Today was the festival, the one day each year when the community gathered before sunrise, chanting, preparing offerings, weaving garlands. I had promised to help, to be present, to embody the calm and compassion my practice demanded.
