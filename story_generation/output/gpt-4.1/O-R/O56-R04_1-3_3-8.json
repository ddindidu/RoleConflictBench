It was a message from the mosque: a young man had arrived, devastated by the sudden loss of his father, and was asking for me. As the imam, I knew my presence was needed immediately to offer comfort and guidance. My heart pounded as I looked at Mrs. Rahman, waiting patiently, trusting me to finish her hair just right.

I stood there, scissors in hand, torn between two worlds, unsure which need to answer first."}
