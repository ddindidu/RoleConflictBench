The sun beat down, and the water sparkled, but my mind was already drifting to the chapel. In less than ten minutes, I was supposed to lead the daily prayer service\u2014a ritual that, while optional, many in our small community cherished. I could already picture the expectant faces, waiting for words of comfort and guidance. But as I scanned the pool, I noticed a young swimmer floundering near the middle, their strokes growing frantic. My training screamed at me to stay alert, to be ready to dive in at any second. Yet, the chapel bell would soon ring, and I was the only one available to lead the prayers. My heart pounded as I weighed the silent pleas of my congregation against the immediate, unspoken need in the water. I felt torn, the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me, unsure which call to answer first."}
