My shift was quiet for now, but I knew at any moment a call could come in, demanding I speed through the city to save a life. Tonight, though, my mind wasn\u2019t only on the road. The community study circle was gathering at the mosque, and tonight\u2019s discussion focused on Quranic verses I hadn\u2019t yet read. I could already imagine the gentle disappointment in my imam\u2019s eyes, the expectation that I would come prepared, ready to reflect and share insights. I wanted to be there, to honor my faith and deepen my understanding, but I also knew my duty as an ambulance driver was to be ready, to respond without hesitation. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the sacred words waiting at the mosque, and the siren\u2019s call that could come at any second. I stared at the Quran on the passenger seat, feeling the weight of both uniforms I wore, uncertain which would demand me first."}
