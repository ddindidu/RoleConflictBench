As a police officer, staying fit isn\u2019t just a personal goal\u2014it\u2019s a duty. My body is my tool, and I owe it to the people I protect to be at my best. Just as I was about to start my warm-up, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Maria, a parishioner from my church. She asked if I had time to talk, not urgently, but she sounded uncertain, maybe even a little lost. As a priest, I know how important it is to be available, to offer comfort and guidance, even if it\u2019s just a conversation about scheduling a future meeting. But I also know that if I skip my workout, I\u2019m not just letting myself down\u2014I\u2019m risking my ability to serve and protect. I stood there, gym bag in hand, torn between the weight of my badge and the collar I wore on Sundays, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
