As an accountant, I knew the quarterly filing was due by noon, and my manager expected every figure to be perfect. I could already feel the pressure building in my chest, the weight of accuracy and deadlines pressing down on me. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized it was almost time for my daily puja. As a Hindu, lighting the lamp and offering prayers at my home altar was not just a ritual\u2014it was a promise to my faith and my family, a moment of peace and gratitude that grounded me every day.\n\nYet, the numbers on the screen blurred as my mind raced. If I paused now for my prayers, I might fall behind on the filings, risking mistakes or missing the deadline. But if I ignored my ritual, I would feel a deep sense of guilt and disconnection, as if I were neglecting a part of myself. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the demands of my profession and the call of my faith, unsure which responsibility to honor first."}
