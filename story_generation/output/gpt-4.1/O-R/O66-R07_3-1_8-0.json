The app pinged again\u2014a passenger, impatient, sent another message: \u201cPlease hurry, I really need to get there fast.\u201d As a taxi driver, I knew my duty was to provide reliable, professional service. I prided myself on punctuality, on being the driver people could count on, especially when they were in a rush. But tonight, the temple bell would soon sound, calling the community together for the evening chant. As a Buddhist, I was expected to join, to sit in stillness with my sangha, to honor the ritual that anchored my week and nourished my spirit.\n\nMy phone buzzed with another notification. The passenger\u2019s location was just a few minutes away, but if I accepted the ride, I\u2019d miss the opening of the ceremony. If I declined, I\u2019d let down someone who needed me\u2014and lose income I couldn\u2019t easily spare. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. The city lights blurred outside, and inside, my mind wrestled with the pull of duty and devotion, the clamor of the world and the quiet call of the temple."}
