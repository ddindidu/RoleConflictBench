She smiled, glancing at my long-sleeved blouse and headscarf, then leaned in, lowering her voice. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the real story with your new client? I\u2019ve heard rumors.\u201d My mind raced. As a lawyer, I knew I was bound by confidentiality\u2014no matter how casual the setting or how friendly the question. But the expectation to be sociable, to build connections, pressed on me. At the same time, I felt the weight of curious glances at my modest attire. Some colleagues had already joked about the \u201cdress code\u201d in the group chat, and I sensed the unspoken pressure to blend in, to be less conspicuous. I felt caught between the professional demand to protect my client\u2019s secrets and the social urge to fit in, between my faith\u2019s call for modesty and the subtle expectation to relax my standards for the sake of office camaraderie. My heart pounded as I searched for words, feeling the tension of these worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
