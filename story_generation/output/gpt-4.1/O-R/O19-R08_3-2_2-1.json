My hands moved with practiced precision, but my mind was restless. The label had to be perfect, the dosage exact\u2014one slip could mean disaster for the patient. I felt the weight of my responsibility as a pharmacist, the expectation to be meticulous, to protect lives with every pill I counted.\n\nBut as I worked, the clock on the wall reminded me of another duty. Ramadan was halfway through, and I was behind on my daily Quran reading. I could feel the guilt pressing in, the sense that I was failing in my spiritual commitment. My heart ached to pause, to open the Quran and recite, to reflect and reconnect with my faith. Yet, the prescription in front of me demanded my full attention. I stood there, torn between the sacred trust of my profession and the sacred trust of my faith, the demands of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
