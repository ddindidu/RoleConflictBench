Pilots\u2019 voices come through, tense and expectant, waiting for my revised climb instructions to keep them safe. My hands hover over the console, ready to respond, but my phone vibrates urgently in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from the synagogue: they need one more person for the minyan to say Kaddish at a funeral, and I\u2019m the only one nearby. My heart pounds. I know how much it means to the mourners, how sacred it is to help them honor the dead. But here, in this tower, dozens of lives depend on my focus and quick decisions. The weight of both worlds presses on me\u2014my duty to the skies, my duty to my faith. I stare at the radar, the phone still buzzing, torn between the voices calling for guidance and the ancient call to prayer."}
