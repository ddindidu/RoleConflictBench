It was Friday, just before noon, and the water shimmered with sunlight and laughter. A few swimmers drifted toward the deep end, nothing alarming, but I kept watch\u2014vigilance was my duty. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the Friday prayer was about to begin. As the imam, the congregation expected me to deliver the Khutbah, to guide them with words of faith and wisdom. I knew the guest speaker was ready, his notes in hand, but many in the community looked forward to my presence, my voice. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014one toward the pool, where safety depended on my constant attention, and the other toward the mosque, where spiritual guidance was my calling. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders, the lifeguard\u2019s red and the imam\u2019s white, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to yield. I stared at the water, torn, as the call to prayer echoed in my mind."}
