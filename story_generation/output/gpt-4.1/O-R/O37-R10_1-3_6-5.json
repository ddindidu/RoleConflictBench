The scent of disinfectant clung to my skin, a reminder of the strict hygiene rules I was expected to follow. My supervisor always said, \u201cGloves on, always. No exceptions.\u201d But sometimes, when the work was light, I slipped them off for comfort, just for a moment.\n\nToday, as I wiped down the reception desk, I overheard two managers whispering. Their words were sharp, urgent\u2014something about hiding evidence of a guest\u2019s injury, blaming it on the guest instead of a broken tile. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand for dharma, to act with honesty and protect others from harm. But if I spoke up, I\u2019d have to admit I wasn\u2019t always following the safety protocols myself. Would they listen to me, or turn the blame on my own lapses? The weight of my gloves felt heavier than ever, caught between my duty to my job and my duty to my conscience."}
