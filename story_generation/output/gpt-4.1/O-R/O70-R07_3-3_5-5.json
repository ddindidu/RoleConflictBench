My delivery route had gone smoothly until now, but this last stop was different. The instructions were clear: hand-deliver the package, verify the recipient\u2019s ID, and ensure nothing went wrong. I knew the recipient\u2019s office closed in thirty minutes, and if I missed them, the company would hold me responsible.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder: the weekly meditation session at the temple started in twenty minutes. As the leader, I was expected to guide everyone in mindfulness, to be calm and present, to help others find peace. I pictured the group waiting for me, trusting me to set the tone for their practice.\n\nMy mind raced. If I rushed the delivery, I might make a mistake or miss the recipient. If I delayed, I\u2019d arrive late to the meditation, disrupting the group\u2019s focus and betraying their trust. My heart pounded as I sat at the intersection, torn between the demands of my job and my commitment to the sangha, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing second."}
