As a judge, I knew the expectation: every file deserved my full attention, even if the case seemed routine. I owed it to the court, to the parties, to justice itself, to be prepared. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the adult education class at the synagogue starting in just an hour. As rabbi, I was expected to be present, to teach, to inspire\u2014even if the class was optional and the topic general. I pictured the handful of regulars who would come, hoping for guidance or a spark of insight. My mind tugged in two directions: the solemn duty to the law, the sacred calling to my community. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on my shoulders, each demanding my time, my focus, my heart. I stared at the file, then at my notes for the class, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
