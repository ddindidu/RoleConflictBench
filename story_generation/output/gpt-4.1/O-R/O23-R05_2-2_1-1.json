As a lawyer, I stared at the thick stack of purchase agreements on my desk, red pen in hand, knowing the filing deadline was just hours away. My client depended on my careful analysis to avoid a costly mistake. Yet, as a rabbi, my mind kept drifting to the Shabbat service that would begin soon. The congregation expected a thoughtful sermon, words of comfort and inspiration, and I hadn\u2019t even begun to prepare. My phone buzzed with reminders from both worlds\u2014emails from the law firm, texts from synagogue members. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing down on me, each role demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I tried to focus, torn between the legal language in front of me and the spiritual message I longed to craft. The sun began to set, and I sat frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice between my two callings."}
