The office is unusually quiet, and my supervisor has just announced that we can take our breaks whenever we want today. Normally, I\u2019d be relieved\u2014flexibility is rare in this job, where every minute is tracked and scheduled. But my mind is elsewhere. My doctor\u2019s words echo in my head: \u201cIf you want to perform Hajj, this year may be your last chance to travel.\u201d As a Muslim, the pilgrimage is a sacred duty, something I\u2019ve dreamed of fulfilling. But the timing couldn\u2019t be worse. Work expects me to be present, to stick to my hours, even if today\u2019s rules are relaxed. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my faith urging me to seize this fleeting opportunity, my job reminding me of my responsibilities and the unspoken consequences of extended absence. My heart pounds as I stare at the break request form, torn between the call of my faith and the demands of my livelihood, unsure which path to choose."}
