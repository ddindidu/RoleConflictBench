The defendant\u2019s family waited anxiously for my order, knowing that every minute delayed meant another minute in custody. As a judge, I was expected to draft a clear, detailed order\u2014no room for error, no time for delay. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my flight for Hajj was in a few hours. The doctor\u2019s words haunted me\u2014this might be my last chance to fulfill my religious duty, a pillar of my faith. My heart pounded as I stared at the blank order form, torn between the demands of justice and the call of my faith. The weight of the robe on my shoulders felt heavier than ever, as if it pressed down on my very soul. I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, each one tightening the knot of conflict inside me."}
