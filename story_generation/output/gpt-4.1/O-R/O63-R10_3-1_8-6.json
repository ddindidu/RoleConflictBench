Today was a special day\u2014one of our local Hindu festivals, and I could see the vibrant colors and hear the chanting from the window. My heart ached to be outside, to join my family and neighbors in the celebration, to offer prayers and feel the warmth of community. But the clock on my screen glared at me, a constant reminder of my telemarketer role. The automated compliance system tracked every second, and I knew that even a minute away from my desk without a scheduled break could mean a warning or worse. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo unscheduled downtime.\u201d Yet, the pull of my faith and the festival was strong. I found myself torn, glancing between the blinking call queue and the joyous scene outside, wrestling with the guilt of possibly neglecting my duties\u2014either to my job or to my beliefs."}
