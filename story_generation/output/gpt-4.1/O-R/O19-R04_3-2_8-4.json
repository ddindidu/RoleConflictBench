The national continuing education program was streaming live, and I needed these credits to maintain my pharmacist license. The latest guidelines on diabetes management scrolled across the screen, and I tried to focus, but my phone buzzed with reminders from the mosque committee. This Friday, I was the only listed imam for the Khutbah, and the community had already shared the topic\u2014\u201cCompassion in Times of Hardship\u201d\u2014on every social media platform. I knew how much the congregation looked forward to the sermon, especially after a difficult week for many. My mind raced with the weight of both responsibilities: the professional expectation to stay current and competent, and the spiritual duty to guide and uplift my community. I felt the pressure mounting, my heart torn between the urgent need to complete my education session and the equally pressing obligation to prepare a meaningful sermon. The clock ticked, and I stared at my notes, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
