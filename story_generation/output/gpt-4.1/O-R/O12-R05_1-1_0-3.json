The code for the new module sprawled before me, and for once, the deadline was generous. I could take my time, refactor, and make it beautiful\u2014clean, maintainable, a model for the team. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but my phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: the adult education class at the synagogue was starting in an hour. It was optional, just a drop-in session on a broad topic, but I knew some people looked forward to these evenings, hoping for insight or connection. As a rabbi, I felt a responsibility to be present, to teach, to listen. Yet, as a developer, I craved the rare luxury of uninterrupted time to perfect my work. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my team counting on quality code, my community seeking guidance. I stared at the screen, heart tugged in two directions, unsure which role to answer first."}
