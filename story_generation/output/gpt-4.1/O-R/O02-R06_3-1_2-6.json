The project manager\u2019s email was curt: \u201cWe can\u2019t move forward until your part is done.\u201d I knew the whole team was waiting on me, their progress stalled. As an engineer, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down\u2014my work was the linchpin, and I was expected to deliver a flawless solution, fast.\n\nBut then, as I was about to dive back in, I noticed my colleague Sarah at the next desk, her eyes red and shoulders slumped. She\u2019d been quiet all morning. My heart tugged at me\u2014my faith taught me to show kindness, to reach out, to be present for others in their struggles. I wanted to offer a listening ear, maybe a comforting word or a cup of coffee. Yet, every minute I spent away from my code would delay the project even more, letting my team down.\n\nI sat frozen, torn between the urgent demands of my role as an engineer and the quiet call of compassion that my faith instilled in me."}
