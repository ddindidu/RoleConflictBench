The app pinged again\u2014my passenger, impatient, sent another message: \u201cPlease hurry, I\u2019m late!\u201d I was only five minutes away, but traffic crawled. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on punctuality and professionalism. My rating depended on it, and so did my family\u2019s livelihood. But then my phone buzzed with a different urgency\u2014a call from the mosque committee. The imam who sometimes filled in for me was stuck in traffic, and the mosque was packed for the special remembrance. \u201cEveryone is waiting for you to lead the prayer,\u201d the committee member pleaded. My heart pounded. I could picture the congregation, eyes on the clock, expecting me to guide them. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing on my chest. If I turned toward the mosque, I\u2019d let down my passenger and risk my reputation. If I continued to the pickup, I\u2019d fail my community at a sacred moment. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I sat at the red light, caught between duty and duty, unable to move."}
