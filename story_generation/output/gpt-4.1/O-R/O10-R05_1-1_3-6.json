As an accountant, I knew how crucial it was to stay ahead of new regulations\u2014my clients depended on me to keep them compliant and avoid costly mistakes. The seminar was scheduled for a weekend next year, and I quickly checked my calendar. That\u2019s when I saw the note: \u201cWedding inquiry\u2014Sarah & Ben, same weekend.\u201d As their rabbi, I was their first choice to officiate, and I knew how much it would mean to them if I could be there. My mind raced with the expectations on both sides. My accounting clients needed my expertise, and missing the seminar could put me behind. But as a rabbi, I was entrusted with guiding people through their most significant moments. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to yield. I sat at my desk, torn, the cursor blinking on my screen, waiting for me to respond."}
