As a police officer, staying fit isn\u2019t just a personal goal\u2014it\u2019s a duty. My captain always says, \u201cYou can\u2019t protect others if you can\u2019t protect yourself.\u201d I take that seriously. Every rep, every mile, is for the people I serve. But lately, my mind drifts elsewhere. My doctor\u2019s words echo in my head: \u201cIf you want to perform Hajj, you should go soon. Your health may not allow it later.\u201d As a Muslim, Hajj is a pillar of my faith, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation. My family urges me to go, reminding me of the spiritual fulfillment and the peace it brings. Yet, the department is short-staffed, and my absence would leave my team vulnerable. I feel torn\u2014my badge weighs heavy on one side, my faith on the other. The treadmill hums beneath me, but my thoughts race faster, caught between duty to my community and duty to my Creator."}
