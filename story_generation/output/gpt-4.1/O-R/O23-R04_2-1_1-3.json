The purchase agreement was dense, and I knew my client depended on my careful analysis to avoid costly mistakes. Every clause demanded my full attention, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: Friday prayer was only an hour away. As the imam, the congregation expected me to deliver the Khutbah, to guide them with wisdom and presence. Today, though, a guest speaker was prepared and willing to step in. I could let him take the pulpit, but I knew some in the community would be disappointed, expecting my voice and leadership. My mind raced between the urgent legal work and the spiritual responsibility. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I stared at the contract, torn between duty to my client and my congregation, knowing I could not give both my best at the same time."}
