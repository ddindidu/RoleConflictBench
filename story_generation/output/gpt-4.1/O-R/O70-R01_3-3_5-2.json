The next stop was a gated house, the package in my passenger seat marked \u201cCONFIDENTIAL\u2014HAND DELIVER ONLY.\u201d I was supposed to check the recipient\u2019s ID, no exceptions. My phone buzzed. It was a message from the church secretary: \u201cShe\u2019s waiting for you. She says it\u2019s urgent.\u201d I knew who \u201cshe\u201d was\u2014a member of my congregation, desperate for guidance, her life at a crossroads. She\u2019d said she couldn\u2019t wait, that she needed me now. My mind raced. The company expected me to deliver the package on time, verify everything, no shortcuts. But as a pastor, I was supposed to be there for people in crisis, to listen, to help them find their way. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the one I wore, and the one I carried in my heart. I sat in my car, torn, the package in my hand and a soul in need on the other end of the phone, not knowing which duty to answer first."}
