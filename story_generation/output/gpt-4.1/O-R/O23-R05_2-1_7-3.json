As a lawyer, I knew the rules: client confidentiality was sacred, not to be breached for anyone, not even for the sake of convenience. Yet here was Miriam, our new assistant, asking for access to files she didn\u2019t need, just to make her work easier. I could see her frustration, her eagerness to prove herself, and I wanted to help. But the law was clear, and so were my professional ethics.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the adult Torah class at the synagogue was starting soon. As a rabbi, I was expected to be there, to teach, to inspire, to answer questions about Jewish law and tradition. The class was optional, but I knew some people came just to see me, to find comfort or guidance. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014one demanding strict adherence to confidentiality, the other calling me to be present and open for my community. My heart pounded as I stared at the files, torn between the expectations of my profession and my calling."}
