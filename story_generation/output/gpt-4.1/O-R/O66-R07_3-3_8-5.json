Please hurry!\u201d I glance at the clock on the dashboard. My passenger, booked through the app, is waiting impatiently, and I know the expectation\u2014swift, professional service, no excuses. But my hands tighten on the steering wheel as I remember the other commitment: the weekly meditation group. I am the leader, and the session starts in twenty minutes. They count on me to guide them, to embody calm and mindfulness, to be present. My mind races, torn between the urgency of the passenger and the quiet responsibility to my fellow practitioners. I feel the pressure mounting, my breath quickening, the taxi\u2019s engine idling as I sit at the crossroads. The world outside demands speed and efficiency; my inner world pleads for stillness and presence. I close my eyes for a moment, caught between the honking city and the silent cushion, wrestling with the weight of both roles pressing in from either side."}
