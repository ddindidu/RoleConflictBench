As a delivery person, I knew the importance of being polite and professional, no matter how rushed I felt. The door opened, and the customer greeted me with a warm smile. We exchanged a few words, and I handed over the package, making sure to thank them for their time.\n\nLater that day, I attended a small community gathering. As a pastor, people expected me to share wisdom and teach religious principles. During a casual conversation, someone mentioned a recent hardship, and I instinctively began to share a story from scripture that I thought might comfort them. Just then, I noticed the same customer from earlier in the crowd, listening intently.\n\nA wave of anxiety washed over me. Should I continue, knowing that my role as a pastor might conflict with the professional neutrality expected of me as a delivery person? Would sharing my beliefs now seem inappropriate or unprofessional to someone who had just seen me in a different context? I felt the tension between my two roles tightening inside me, unsure of which expectation to fulfill."}
