A couple of regulars come in, and I greet them with a smile, making small talk as I ring up their groceries. My manager always says that friendly service keeps people coming back, and I try my best to live up to that. But as I hand over the receipt, my mind drifts to something else\u2014my savings, carefully tucked away for years, meant for Hajj. This year, my friends are finally going, and they keep sending me messages, urging me to join them. \n\nI feel the weight of their excitement and the religious pull, the sense that this is my time, my duty as a Muslim. But I also know the store is short-staffed, and my manager is counting on me. If I leave now, even for a couple of weeks, it could put everyone in a tough spot. I want to be the reliable cashier my team expects, but I also want to fulfill my faith. The two roles tug at me from opposite sides, and as I greet the next customer, my heart pounds with uncertainty, caught between duty and devotion."}
