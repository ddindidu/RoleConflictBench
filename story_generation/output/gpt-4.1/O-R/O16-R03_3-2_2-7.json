A patient lies before me, gasping for breath, his symptoms baffling and severe. My mind races through possible diagnoses, desperate to find the answer that could save his life. The weight of my stethoscope feels heavier than usual, as if it knows the stakes. Suddenly, my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a message from Sister Agnes. A parishioner, Maria, is waiting in the chapel, seeking guidance for her crisis of faith. She needs me, not as Dr. Elena, but as Sister Elena, to listen, to pray, to offer comfort. I glance at the patient, then at the clock, feeling the pull of both worlds. The hospital expects me to be the healer, the one who never falters.
