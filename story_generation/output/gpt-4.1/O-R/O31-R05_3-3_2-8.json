As a police officer, I knew every second counted; lives were at stake, and my duty was clear: respond, protect, enforce the law. My hand hovered over the ignition, adrenaline surging, when my phone buzzed. It was Miriam, her voice trembling. \u201cRabbi, my father just passed. We need you for the funeral\u2014please, it has to be today.\u201d I heard the grief in her words, the expectation that I would guide her family through this sacred moment, as I always had for my congregation. My badge weighed heavy on my chest, but so did my tallit, folded in the back seat. I stared at the intersection ahead, torn between the siren\u2019s call and the quiet, desperate plea of a grieving family. Both roles demanded my presence, my heart, my leadership\u2014right now. I gripped the steering wheel, feeling the impossible pull of duty and devotion, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
