My mind kept drifting to the memorial service at the temple tonight\u2014an important Buddhist ceremony, one I was expected to attend and help lead. The community would be gathering, and my absence would be noticed. But as I scanned the water, I spotted a child in the deep end, flailing where swimming was strictly forbidden. My training screamed at me to enforce the rules, to act immediately for safety. Yet, if I intervened now, I\u2019d be late for the ceremony, disappointing my teacher and the sangha, betraying the calm presence I was supposed to embody. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles\u2014protector of life and devoted practitioner\u2014each demanding my full attention, each pulling me in opposite directions. I gripped the whistle, torn between the urgent call of duty and the quiet pull of spiritual commitment, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me as the seconds ticked by."}
