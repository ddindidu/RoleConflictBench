The deadline for closing the books was tomorrow, and I was buried in spreadsheets, double-checking every number. My manager stopped by my desk, his voice low. \u201cWe need to adjust the numbers for this quarter,\u201d he said, sliding a file toward me. \u201cJust move some expenses to next month. It\u2019s not illegal, just creative accounting. We need to show better results.\u201d My heart pounded. As an accountant, I was expected to prepare and maintain financial records accurately, to meet deadlines and keep the company running smoothly.

I stared at the file, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
