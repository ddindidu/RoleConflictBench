My mind wandered to the community gathering I\u2019d attended earlier, where, as a pastor, I\u2019d shared a story about honesty and integrity. The words still echoed in my mind: \u201cWe are called to live truthfully, even when no one is watching.\u201d As a cashier, I was expected to process every transaction accurately, no shortcuts, no mistakes. Suddenly, a regular customer approached, chatting amiably as I scanned her groceries. She handed me a coupon that had just expired. She smiled, \u201cYou can still take it, right? No one will know.\u201d I hesitated, feeling the weight of her expectation for a favor and the store\u2019s policy against expired coupons. My role as a pastor pressed on me\u2014how could I teach honesty and then bend the rules here? My heart pounded as I looked at her hopeful face, the line behind her, and the register screen blinking, waiting for my decision."}
