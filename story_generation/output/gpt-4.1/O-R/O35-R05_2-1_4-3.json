My heart thudded. Protocol demanded I stop the train at the next station, alert security, and keep passengers calm. Every second mattered for their safety. But as I reached for the intercom, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the adult Torah class I was to teach in half an hour. I\u2019d promised the group, some of whom were new to Jewish learning, that I\u2019d be there to answer their questions and guide them through the text. They counted on me for wisdom and reassurance, especially those seeking comfort in uncertain times. I stared at the blinking control panel, feeling the weight of both uniforms: the operator responsible for hundreds of lives, the rabbi entrusted with souls seeking meaning. The train slowed, the station lights approaching, and I felt torn\u2014duty to my passengers, duty to my students. My hands trembled as I prepared to act, caught between two worlds, each demanding all of me."}
