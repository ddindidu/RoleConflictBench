It was a special honor, and my family had been looking forward to it for weeks. But as I checked the assignment board, I saw that Mrs. Klein, who\u2019d just had surgery, was my responsibility today. She needed extra help\u2014her movements slow, her pain obvious. I knew she\u2019d need me to help her bathe, dress, and settle in for breakfast, and I couldn\u2019t rush her. \n\nYet, the service at synagogue started soon, and I was expected to be there, not just as a participant, but as someone leading a part of the prayers. My supervisor expected me to give my full attention to Mrs. Klein, and my community expected me to be present and prepared at the synagogue. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, my heart torn between the needs of my patient and the commitments of my faith. I stood in the hallway, listening to Mrs. Klein call for help, while my phone buzzed with a reminder about the service, caught in the impossible space between duty and devotion."}
