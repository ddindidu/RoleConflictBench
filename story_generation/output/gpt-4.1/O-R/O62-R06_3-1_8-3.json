My shift always overlapped with Sunday worship, and I felt the familiar ache of missing church, the hymns, and the sense of community. I promised myself I\u2019d go next week, if only I could get the time off. Suddenly, I spotted a child in the deep end, flailing\u2014right where swimming was off-limits. My training kicked in: I had to enforce the rules, keep everyone safe, and act fast. But as I prepared to blow my whistle and jump in, my mind flashed to the church bulletin I\u2019d tucked in my bag, the reminder of my commitment to worship and serve. I felt torn\u2014my duty to protect these swimmers clashed with my longing to be present in my faith community. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and for a moment, I hesitated, caught between the urgent demands of my job and the quiet call of my faith."}
