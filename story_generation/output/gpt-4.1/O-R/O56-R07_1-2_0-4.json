My weekly meditation group would begin in ten minutes, just enough time to close up and walk to the temple. I felt the familiar anticipation of quiet, of letting go, of breathing with others who valued stillness. Just then, the bell above the door jingled. Mrs. Lee, a regular, walked in, her face brightening when she saw me. The receptionist was free, but Mrs. Lee always preferred me, and I knew she expected a warm greeting and a chat before her trim. I could see her looking forward to our usual banter, the comfort she found in our small rituals. My heart tugged in two directions: the gentle pull of my sangha, the promise of peace and presence, and the immediate, tangible need to be here, to offer kindness and connection in my salon. I felt the tension coil in my chest, the competing demands of being present for others and for myself, and I stood there, caught between the hum of clippers and the hush of meditation bells."}
