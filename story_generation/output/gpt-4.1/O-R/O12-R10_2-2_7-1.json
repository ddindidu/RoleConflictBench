The QA team had flagged the issue as urgent, and my manager\u2019s message was clear: fix it before the end of the day. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, mind racing through possible causes, but the clock on the wall caught my eye. It was almost sunset. Every evening, I set aside this time to light a lamp and offer prayers at my home altar\u2014a ritual that grounds me, connects me to my faith, and brings peace after a hectic day.\n\nBut now, the demands of my job pressed in. If I stepped away, even for fifteen minutes, I risked missing a breakthrough or delaying the fix. Yet, skipping my prayers felt like neglecting a promise to myself and my beliefs. The tension built inside me, a tug-of-war between my responsibility to my users and my devotion to my spiritual practice. I sat frozen, torn between the glowing screen and the quiet altar, heart pounding as I weighed which part of myself I would have to set aside, even if just for tonight."}
