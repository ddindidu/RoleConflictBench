As the company\u2019s accountant, I was expected to ensure every figure was precise, every regulation followed. The quarterly tax filing was due next week, and the paperwork was a mountain I had yet to climb. My supervisor\u2019s reminder email flashed on my screen: \u201cCompliance is critical\u2014no mistakes.\u201d \n\nBut as a nun, my heart was pulled in another direction. Today was the monthly food drive at the convent, a day when we gathered to serve the homeless at the local shelter. Sister Maria\u2019s gentle voice had already called down the hall, \u201cWe need all hands in the kitchen.\u201d The expectation was clear: my presence was needed, not just as a helper, but as a sister devoted to service.\n\nI stared at the spreadsheets, then at my habit hanging by the door. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest\u2014one demanding precision and duty, the other compassion and presence. My hands trembled as I tried to decide where I was needed most, feeling the impossible pull of two callings that refused to let go."}
