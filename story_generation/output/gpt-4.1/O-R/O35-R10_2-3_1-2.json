The train hummed beneath me, passengers swaying gently as we glided through the tunnel. My watch beeped\u2014reminding me it was time for my midday prayer. As a Hindu, I never missed my daily rituals: the chanting, the offerings, the quiet moments of devotion. But today, a minor signal delay flickered on my panel. I needed to adjust the speed, keep the train on schedule, and avoid any sudden stops that might jostle the passengers. My duty as a subway operator demanded my full attention, every second counted for their safety and punctuality. Yet, my heart tugged me toward my spiritual commitment, the sacred time I had promised to honor. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the train\u2019s rhythm clashing with the rhythm of my prayers. My hands hovered over the controls, my mind torn between the expectations of my faith and the responsibility of my job, unsure which call to answer first."}
