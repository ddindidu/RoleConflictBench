The judgment was due in less than a month, and the case was complex\u2014every word I wrote would shape lives. My mind raced with legal arguments, searching for clarity, when my phone buzzed. It was the mosque committee: a special remembrance gathering had drawn a crowd, and I was the only authorized imam present. They needed me to lead the prayers, to offer guidance and comfort to the community. I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. As a judge, I owed the court a thorough, reasoned decision. As an imam, I owed my congregation spiritual leadership, especially on such a significant night. The expectations of both roles pulled at me, each urgent, each sacred. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands, torn between the silent call of justice and the voices waiting in the mosque."}
