The dispatcher\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cThis delivery is urgent\u2014patients are waiting.\u201d I checked my watch, calculating the route, knowing every minute mattered. But my phone buzzed again, this time with a message from Sister Agnes: \u201cThe mayor needs us. The hurricane\u2019s aftermath is worse than we thought. Can you help organize the relief center?\u201d My heart twisted. As a nun, I was expected to be there for the suffering, to lead with compassion, especially now when so many had lost everything. Yet as a delivery person, I was entrusted with the lives of patients who depended on these supplies. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders. The van\u2019s engine idled, and I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the hospital\u2019s urgent need and the desperate faces of my community."}
