A customer was calling, their voice sharp and impatient, demanding to know why their package hadn\u2019t arrived yet. I could hear the frustration in their tone, and I knew my job required me to stay calm, polite, and professional, no matter how I felt. But as I checked the delivery log, I realized the package had been marked as delivered by mistake\u2014by someone else on my team. The truth was, it wasn\u2019t at their door, and I could easily lie to smooth things over, blaming a system error or traffic, and avoid getting my coworker in trouble. But my faith tugged at me, reminding me that honesty and integrity are at the heart of my beliefs as a Christian. I felt the pressure mounting: the company expected me to keep customers happy and avoid complaints, but my conscience wouldn\u2019t let me ignore the truth. My heart pounded as I weighed my words, caught between the demands of my job and the values I hold dear."}
