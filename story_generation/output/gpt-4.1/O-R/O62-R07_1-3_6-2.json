My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cNo one in the shallow end without a lifeguard present. No exceptions.\u201d Yet, as the sun rises, I see a few early swimmers slipping into the shallow area, laughing quietly, trusting that I\u2019ll look the other way just this once. My duty is clear\u2014enforce the rules, keep everyone safe, even if it means being stern or unpopular.\n\nBut today is also the monastery\u2019s annual festival, the one day my sangha gathers before dawn to chant, prepare offerings, and welcome the community. I promised my teacher I\u2019d help set up, that I\u2019d be present in body and spirit, honoring the tradition that grounds me. The expectation is not just to show up, but to be fully engaged, to serve with humility and joy.\n\nStanding at the pool\u2019s edge, I feel the tension coil inside me. The swimmers\u2019 safety depends on my vigilance, but my heart aches to be with my Buddhist community, fulfilling a promise that feels just as sacred. I grip the whistle, torn between two worlds, unsure which call to answer."}
