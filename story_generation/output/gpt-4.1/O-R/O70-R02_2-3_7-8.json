I knew I needed to respond quickly and professionally, reassuring them and maintaining the company\u2019s reputation. But just as I was about to type a reply, another message came through\u2014this one from a parishioner. Their family\u2019s child was about to receive a major sacrament, and they needed me to organize a last-minute, mandatory preparation session that evening. I could hear the urgency in their words; this was a milestone for their child, and as their priest, I was expected to guide them through it with care and dedication.\n\nMy mind raced. If I delayed my deliveries to prepare for the class, customers would be left waiting, possibly upset. If I focused on finishing my route, I\u2019d risk letting down a family at a crucial spiritual moment. Both roles demanded my full attention, both expected compassion and reliability. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides, my heart pounding as I stared at the two messages, torn between duty and devotion, unsure which path to take."}
