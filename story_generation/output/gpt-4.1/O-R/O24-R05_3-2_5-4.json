The defendant\u2019s anxious family waited outside, desperate for news. As a judge, I knew I had to draft the release order immediately\u2014every minute I delayed meant more time the defendant spent in custody. The law demanded clarity and precision; my words would shape the next steps for everyone involved. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the children\u2019s Torah class was about to begin. As their rabbi, I was expected to guide them, to be present and patient, to answer their questions about faith and tradition. I imagined their eager faces, waiting for stories and wisdom. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward justice and toward teaching. The clock ticked louder, each second a reminder of the expectations pressing in from both sides. I stared at the blank order on my screen, my mind torn, feeling the weight of both robes I wore."}
