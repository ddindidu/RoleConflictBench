As a taxi driver, I prided myself on following every traffic law, keeping my passengers safe, and never rushing, no matter how empty the roads seemed. But tonight, my mind was elsewhere. Sister Agnes from my parish had called, her voice trembling\u2014one of our members was in crisis, desperate to talk, and she needed me at the convent as soon as possible. The expectation weighed on me: as a nun, I was to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and spiritual guidance. Yet here I was, behind the wheel, torn between my duty to drive responsibly and my calling to be there for someone in need. My foot hovered over the accelerator, heart pounding, as I wrestled with the urge to speed through the green lights, to cut corners, to get there faster. The city\u2019s rules and the convent\u2019s needs pulled me in opposite directions, and I felt the tension coil tighter with every passing block."}
