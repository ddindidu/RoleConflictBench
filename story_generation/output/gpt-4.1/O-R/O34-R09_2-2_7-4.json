Thunderstorms had forced half the airspace to shift, and my headset buzzed with rapid-fire handoffs from neighboring controllers. Every second, I coordinated, calculated, and communicated, knowing a single mistake could ripple into chaos. My stomach growled, reminding me I hadn\u2019t eaten since dawn. I glanced at the clock\u2014barely time for a break. The only food nearby was from a tiny vendor I knew was kosher, but the line was always long, and I\u2019d barely have minutes before I was needed back at my station. The expectation to keep traffic flowing smoothly pressed on me, but so did my commitment to keeping kosher, a daily anchor to my identity. I felt the tension coil inside me\u2014if I left, I might let my team down in a critical moment; if I stayed, I\u2019d go hungry or break a core tenet of my faith. The pressure of both roles pressed in, and I hesitated, torn between duty to the skies and duty to myself."}
