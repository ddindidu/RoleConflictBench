The policy was clear: every large cash deposit had to be double-checked, logged, and locked away before I could leave. I glanced at the clock\u2014already past my shift. Just then, a woman knocked on the glass door, her face anxious. She mouthed, \u201cPlease, I need help.\u201d I recognized her from earlier; she\u2019d left her wallet at the counter. Store policy said no one was allowed back in after closing, especially with the deposit out. But my heart ached\u2014Jesus taught us to show kindness, to help those in need. I felt torn, the weight of the cash in my hands and the weight of my faith pressing on my chest. The rules were strict, but so was the call to love.
