As the company\u2019s accountant, I was expected to ensure every figure was accurate, every regulation followed, and the quarterly filing submitted on time. The pressure was mounting; any mistake could mean penalties for the business and a stain on my professional reputation.\n\nJust as I was double-checking the deductions, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the parish office: a family needed a final, mandatory preparation session for their child\u2019s sacrament\u2014tonight. As their priest, I was expected to guide them, to be present, compassionate, and thorough, especially with something so significant for their faith journey.\n\nI stared at the screen, heart pounding. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent, and both carried consequences if neglected. I felt torn, the expectations pulling me in opposite directions, my mind racing as I tried to figure out how to be both the diligent accountant and the devoted priest, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
