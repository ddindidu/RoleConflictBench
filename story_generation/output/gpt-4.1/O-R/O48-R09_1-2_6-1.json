She\u2019d been especially lonely lately, and I knew how much she looked forward to our chats. As I sat beside her, she reached for my hand, her voice trembling as she told me about her late husband. I listened, offering comfort, feeling the weight of her loneliness settle between us. But in the back of my mind, I couldn\u2019t ignore the growing anxiety. The holiday was only days away, and I still hadn\u2019t taught my children the blessings they needed to know. My community expected me to pass on our traditions, to make sure my kids understood the meaning behind every prayer and song. I felt torn\u2014here, I was needed as a source of comfort and companionship, but at home, I was needed as a teacher and guide. The clock on the wall ticked louder, each second a reminder that I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart ached as I tried to focus on Mrs. Green\u2019s story, wrestling with the guilt of letting down my children and my community."}
