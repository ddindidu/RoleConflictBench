My manager\u2019s eyes flick to me, reminding me to keep things moving, but the woman in front of me is furious about a coupon that won\u2019t scan. I force a smile, apologizing, trying to soothe her, even as my mind races with the words of the sermon I still haven\u2019t finished. The High Holiday service is tonight, and the congregation expects inspiration, guidance\u2014something meaningful. I feel the weight of their anticipation pressing on me, even as I nod and offer the customer a discount to calm her down. My phone buzzes in my pocket: a reminder to review my notes before sundown. I can\u2019t leave the register, not with the holiday rush, not with my coworkers already stretched thin. I\u2019m supposed to be present, patient, a model of kindness here. But I\u2019m also supposed to be a spiritual leader, prepared and focused. My heart pounds as I wonder how I can possibly be both at once."}
