Suddenly, a red light flashed\u2014a critical brake system alert. My training screamed at me: report immediately, stop the train, ensure everyone\u2019s safety. My heart pounded. But then my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a reminder: the main weekly service at the church was about to begin. As the priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, offer comfort, and be present for my community. They counted on me, especially today, when so many would gather seeking guidance. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me\u2014the operator\u2019s cap, the priest\u2019s collar. If I stopped the train, I\u2019d miss the service and disappoint my congregation. If I ignored the alert, I\u2019d risk the safety of hundreds. My hands trembled on the controls, torn between duty to my passengers and my parishioners, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
