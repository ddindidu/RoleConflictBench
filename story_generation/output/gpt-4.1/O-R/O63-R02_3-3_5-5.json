My bonus, and the team\u2019s, hung in the balance. I dialed number after number, my script ready, my voice practiced and persuasive. Each call was a step closer to the goal, but the pressure gnawed at me. Then, my phone vibrated with a message from the church secretary: someone had arrived at the chapel, desperate and in tears, asking for me by name. As a priest, I knew what was expected\u2014compassion, presence, guidance. But as a telemarketer, I was tethered to my headset, responsible for my livelihood and my colleagues\u2019 hopes. My heart pounded as I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the ringing phone and the silent plea from the sanctuary. The weight of both worlds pressed in, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between duty and calling, unable to move."}
