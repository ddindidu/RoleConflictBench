As her doctor, I knew the only effective treatment was a medication with significant side effects, including the risk of addiction. The guidelines were clear: prescribe what is medically necessary, monitor closely, and trust in my training. But as a Christian, I felt the weight of stewardship and compassion, the call to do no harm, not just physically but spiritually. I remembered sermons about caring for the whole person, about not leading others into temptation. My mind raced with the expectations of my profession\u2014relieve suffering, follow evidence, respect autonomy\u2014while my faith whispered about responsibility, about the consequences of my actions beyond the clinic walls. I could see her hope, her trust in me, and I felt torn between my oath as a physician and my conscience as a believer. The prescription pad sat heavy in my hand, and I hesitated, caught in the silent struggle between my two worlds."}
