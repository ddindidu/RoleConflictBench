As a cashier, I knew the importance of accuracy\u2014one wrong move, and the numbers wouldn\u2019t add up, leaving me responsible for a costly mistake. My hands moved quickly, sorting twenties from fives, when I heard a familiar voice. It was Brother Ahmed, a regular customer and a member of my congregation.
