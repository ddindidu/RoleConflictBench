My client\u2019s future hinged on my preparation; the contested motion was critical, and I knew I needed every spare moment to be ready. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: church service in an hour. As a Christian, I was expected to be present, to worship, and to join the community in prayer and fellowship. My pastor had even asked me to help with the youth group after the service. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my client\u2019s anxious voice from our last call echoed in my mind, while the memory of last week\u2019s sermon about faithfulness tugged at my conscience.
