The request was urgent\u2014he needed the quarterly financials, and he needed them now. As the firm\u2019s accountant, accuracy and timeliness were non-negotiable. I could already imagine the partners\u2019 disappointment if I delayed, the ripple effect on our reputation. But my phone buzzed, and I saw a message from Miriam, the conversion candidate. Her final study session was in half an hour. She was anxious, relying on me to guide her through the last, crucial points before her Beit Din. As her rabbi, I was her anchor, her teacher, the one entrusted to help her cross this spiritual threshold. Both roles demanded my full presence, my undivided attention. I felt the weight of expectation pressing from both sides\u2014numbers and souls, spreadsheets and sacred texts. My mind raced, torn between the ledger and the Torah, between professional duty and spiritual calling. I sat at my desk, paralyzed, knowing I could not give both what they deserved at the same time."}
