The sensor error had halted everything for half an hour, and the supervisor\u2019s anxious glances made it clear: every minute lost was money slipping away. My mind raced through possible causes\u2014faulty wiring, a software glitch, maybe a misaligned component. I needed to focus, to diagnose and fix this fast.\n\nJust then, my phone vibrated. It was a message from a young couple, asking if I could officiate their wedding next year. They wanted to talk now, to secure the date and begin planning. As a rabbi, I knew how important this was to them\u2014how much comfort and guidance they sought in these first steps. But the hum of the silent machines and the weight of my coworkers\u2019 expectations pressed on me. I stared at my phone, torn between the urgent demands of the factory and the sacred trust of my calling. My hands trembled, caught between two worlds, each asking for all of me at once."}
