They need a ruling within the hour.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014forty-five minutes until the daily prayer service I was to lead as the community\u2019s priest. My congregation expected me to be present, to guide them in prayer, to offer comfort and stability. Yet, the law demanded my immediate attention; a family\u2019s safety might hinge on my swift, careful judgment. My mind raced, torn between the sacred duty to my faith and the solemn oath to uphold justice. I could not be in two places at once. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my parishioners\u2019 trust, the litigants\u2019 hope. My heart pounded as I stared at the file, the church bell faintly chiming in the distance, and I wondered which calling I would have to let down today."}
