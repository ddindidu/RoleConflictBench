My manager\u2019s eyes flick to the clock, silently urging me to keep the line moving, to avoid mistakes, to be the efficient cashier they expect. But as I hand change to a tired mother, the chapel bell tolls\u2014its chime a gentle but insistent reminder that morning prayers are beginning. My heart tightens. As a nun, I am expected to be present, to join my sisters in devotion, to honor the sacred rhythm of our day. Yet here I am, tethered to the register, responsible for these customers and the store\u2019s flow. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the secular demand for speed and accuracy, the spiritual call to prayer and presence. My hands tremble slightly as I scan another item, torn between duty to my work and duty to my faith, knowing I cannot be in two places at once."}
