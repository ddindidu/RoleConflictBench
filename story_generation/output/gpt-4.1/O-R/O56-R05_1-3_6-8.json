She smiled, explaining she\u2019d just shampooed at home, but I knew the salon\u2019s policy: every client\u2019s hair must be washed and conditioned before I cut or style. As I debated whether to insist, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from the synagogue board\u2014one of our beloved congregants had passed away, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral as soon as possible. My heart tightened. As a rabbi, I am expected to be present for my community in their moments of grief, to guide them through rituals and offer comfort. But right now, I was also a hairdresser, with a client in my chair and a schedule to keep. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the duty to my client, the expectations of my faith community, and the impossibility of being fully present for both at once. I stood there, scissors in hand, torn between the needs of the living and the rituals for the departed, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
