The machine sputtered, and another batch of material was wasted. My job as a repairer wasn\u2019t just to fix breakdowns\u2014I was expected to guide clients, help them use the machines properly, and prevent these costly mistakes. But every time I tried to explain, the operator brushed me off, insisting he knew what he was doing. I felt the pressure from my supervisor to reduce waste, to be proactive, to stay until the job was done right.\n\nYet, as I glanced at the clock, I realized Sunday service would start soon. I hadn\u2019t been to church in weeks, always telling myself I\u2019d go when time allowed. My faith was important to me\u2014worship, community, a sense of peace I couldn\u2019t find anywhere else. But now, with the machine acting up and the operator refusing to listen, I felt torn. Should I stay and keep trying, fulfilling my duty as a repairer, or leave for church, honoring my commitment as a Christian? The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood there, caught between two worlds, unsure which to choose."}
