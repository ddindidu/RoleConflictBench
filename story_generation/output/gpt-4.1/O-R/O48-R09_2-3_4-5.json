The patient\u2019s temperature was a little high, pulse a bit fast\u2014nothing alarming, but I knew I had to record every detail and report any changes. My supervisor expected accuracy and vigilance; the patient\u2019s recovery depended on it. My stomach rumbled, reminding me I hadn\u2019t eaten since early morning. Down the hall, the staff lounge buzzed with laughter from the communal lunch. I peeked in and saw trays of food, but none bore the kosher certification I needed. I felt the familiar ache of hunger and isolation. My colleagues expected me to join, to be part of the team, but I couldn\u2019t compromise my beliefs. I glanced at the patient\u2019s chart, then at the food, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. I wanted to do right by my patient and my faith, but the demands seemed to pull me in opposite directions. My hands trembled as I tried to focus on the numbers, my mind torn between duty and devotion, unsure which expectation I could meet without letting the other down."}
