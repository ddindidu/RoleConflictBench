As a telemarketer, I was still three sales short of my weekly target, and management had made it clear that falling short would mean a stern meeting on Monday. My call list was dwindling, and desperation crept into my voice as I dialed number after number, rehearsing my pitch in my mind. But at 4:00 PM, I was supposed to be at the synagogue, leading the children\u2019s Torah class. As their rabbi, I was expected to guide them, to be present and patient, to answer their questions about faith and tradition. The parents trusted me to nurture their children\u2019s spiritual growth. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cReligious school in 1 hour.\u201d My stomach twisted. If I stayed to make more calls, I might hit my target, but I\u2019d be late for class, letting down the children and their families. If I left now, I\u2019d risk my job. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stared at the phone, torn between duty and duty, unable to move."}
