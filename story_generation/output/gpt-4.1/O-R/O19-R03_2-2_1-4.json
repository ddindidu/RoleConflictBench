Her chart was complicated\u2014hypertension, diabetes, and a new heart medication. I knew how much she depended on me to get every detail right. My hands moved with practiced care, but my mind was elsewhere. The convent bell had rung earlier than usual, calling all the sisters to a special healing service for Sister Maria, who had taken a sudden turn for the worse. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to pray and support my community in their time of need. Yet here I was, surrounded by bottles and labels, torn between my duty to my patient and my devotion to my sisters. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full presence, each too important to neglect. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock again, feeling the pull of the chapel and the responsibility of the pharmacy."}
