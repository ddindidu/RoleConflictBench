My job demanded unwavering attention\u2014one distracted moment could mean disaster. As I watched the swimmers, I noticed a young boy in the middle of the pool, his strokes growing weaker. My training screamed at me to stay alert, ready to leap in if he slipped under.\n\nJust then, an elderly woman approached the poolside, her hands trembling as she tried to open her water bottle. She looked up at me, her eyes pleading for help. My heart ached; my faith taught me to show kindness, to help those in need, no matter how small the gesture. But if I left my post, even for a second, I risked missing a life-or-death moment in the water.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me.
