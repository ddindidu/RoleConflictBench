The latest batch of results blinked on my screen, waiting to be logged. As a scientist, I knew the importance of accuracy\u2014every detail mattered, and I prided myself on keeping meticulous records. Still, the logs could wait until tomorrow; the schedule was flexible, and nothing urgent would be lost.\n\nJust as I reached for my mug, my phone buzzed. A message from the church group: \u201cSarah\u2019s having a rough day. Could you check in?\u201d As a pastor, I felt the weight of their expectation\u2014my words, even a simple text, could offer comfort. I pictured Sarah alone, maybe waiting for someone to notice.\n\nI stared at the screen, torn. The scientist in me whispered that the data deserved my attention, that discipline was my duty. The pastor in me urged compassion, reminding me that people needed me, too. My hands hovered, uncertain, as the two parts of myself pulled in opposite directions, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
