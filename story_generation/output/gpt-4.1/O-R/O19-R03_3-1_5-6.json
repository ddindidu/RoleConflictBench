My habit was hidden beneath my white coat, a silent reminder of the life I led outside these walls. Today, I had promised myself a rare, uninterrupted afternoon for spiritual reading and reflection\u2014a time to reconnect with God, to nourish my soul as a nun. But just as I was about to leave, Mrs. Alvarez arrived, clutching a paper bag of new prescriptions. Her chart showed a tangle of high-risk medications, each with the potential to harm if not managed carefully. As a pharmacist, I knew I couldn\u2019t let her leave without a thorough consultation. My duty was clear: ensure her safety, explain every interaction, answer every question. Yet, my heart ached for the quiet chapel, the open Bible, the peace I\u2019d been longing for all week. The expectations of my two worlds collided inside me\u2014one demanding my presence for healing of the body, the other calling me to tend to my spirit. I stood at the counter, torn, the weight of both vocations heavy on my shoulders."}
