His surgery had left him weak, and every movement was a careful negotiation between pain and necessity. As a nursing assistant, I knew my duty was to help him dress, to make sure he felt safe and cared for. But my mind kept drifting to the convent\u2019s kitchen, where my sisters were already bustling about, preparing for the monthly food drive. As a nun, I was expected to be there, hands deep in flour, heart open to the needs of the hungry. The clock ticked louder with every passing minute, and I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders. Mr. Harris looked at me, trusting, vulnerable. I could almost hear Sister Agnes\u2019s gentle reminder: \u201cCharity begins at home, but it must not end there.\u201d My heart ached, torn between the patient before me and the community waiting beyond these hospital walls."}
