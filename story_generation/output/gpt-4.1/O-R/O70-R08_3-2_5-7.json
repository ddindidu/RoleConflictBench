The company trusted me with high-value deliveries because I never cut corners. But as I waited, my phone buzzed with messages from friends already in Mecca, their photos and prayers filling our group chat. This was the year I\u2019d finally saved enough for Hajj, a duty I\u2019d dreamed of fulfilling since childhood. My family and community expected me to go, and I felt the weight of their hopes. Yet, my supervisor had just called, reminding me that any missed or delayed delivery could cost me my job\u2014and the savings I\u2019d worked so hard to build. The recipient was running late, and every minute I waited, I felt the tension between my commitment to my work and my longing to answer the call to pilgrimage. My heart pounded as I stared at the package, torn between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
