The outage alert glared at me from my laptop\u2014users were locked out, and the logs pointed straight to a bug in my code. My team was already in a panic, pinging me for answers, expecting me to drop everything and fix it. At the same time, my friend\u2019s gentle reminder popped up: \u201cReady to talk about the sermon?\u201d I felt the tug of two worlds\u2014one demanding immediate action, the other inviting me to pause, reflect, and nurture my spiritual path. My mind raced, torn between the urgent responsibility to my team and customers, and the quiet, sacred space I\u2019d promised to share with my friend. The pressure built inside me, a storm of guilt and anxiety, as I stared at the screen, caught between the clamor of code and the call to mindfulness, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
