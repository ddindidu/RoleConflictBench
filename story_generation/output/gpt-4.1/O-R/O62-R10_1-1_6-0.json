As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce every safety rule, no exceptions. Today, a group of kids kept slipping into the shallow end when I turned my head. I called out warnings, but they\u2019d sneak back in, giggling. My supervisor expected strictness, but I also knew the kids just wanted to have fun. \n\nMeanwhile, as a practicing Hindu, I was supposed to perform my daily rituals at sunrise, but my early shift made that impossible. Instead, I quietly repeated a short mantra under my breath, hoping it was enough. I felt guilty for not following the full ritual, but I couldn\u2019t leave my post. \n\nNow, as I watched the kids, I felt the weight of both roles. Should I leave my mantra unfinished to intervene again, or trust that a few words were enough for today? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I could feel my heart pounding as I tried to decide what to do next."}
