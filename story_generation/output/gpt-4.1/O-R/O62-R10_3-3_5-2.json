I knelt down, inspecting the machinery, and my heart sank\u2014something was wrong. The water wasn\u2019t circulating properly, and if I didn\u2019t fix it now, swimmers could be at risk. As a lifeguard, it\u2019s my duty to keep everyone safe, and that means maintaining every piece of equipment, no matter what.\n\nBut then I glanced at my watch. The time for my morning puja was fast approaching. As a Hindu, my daily rituals are sacred\u2014prayers, chanting, and offerings, all performed at precise times. Skipping or delaying them feels unthinkable, a break in the discipline I\u2019ve followed for years. My family and community expect this devotion, and so do I.\n\nI stood there, torn.
