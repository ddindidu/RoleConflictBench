As her doctor, I knew she needed reassurance and clear answers, so I explained her test results and offered advice, making sure to speak gently and with empathy. But as I spoke, my phone buzzed with a reminder: Shabbat was only a few hours away, and I still hadn\u2019t finished preparing my sermon. As the rabbi of our small congregation, everyone expected me to deliver a thoughtful, inspiring message each week. My mind raced with unfinished ideas and the pressure to meet my community\u2019s spiritual needs. Yet here I was, in my white coat, expected to be fully present for my patient. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my duty to care for Mrs. Goldstein in this moment, and my responsibility to guide my congregation soon after. My heart pounded as I tried to focus, torn between the immediate needs before me and the looming expectations waiting at the synagogue."}
