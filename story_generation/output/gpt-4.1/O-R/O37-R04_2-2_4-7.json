The client always expected the house spotless, and I was responsible for keeping supplies stocked. The next cleaning was in three days, but I knew the store was out of my way and I\u2019d have to go after my shift, even though I was already tired. As I packed up, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Brother Ahmed, a long-time congregant. He sounded desperate, asking if I could meet him soon to talk about his family troubles. As an imam, I knew how much he relied on me for guidance, especially in times like this. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the client\u2019s unspoken expectation that their home would be perfect, and Ahmed\u2019s need for spiritual support. My mind raced, torn between the practical duty of restocking supplies and the moral responsibility to be there for someone in crisis. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding, unsure which path to take first."}
