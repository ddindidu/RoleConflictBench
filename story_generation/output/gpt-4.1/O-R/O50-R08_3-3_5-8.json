As the machine repairer, everyone expects me to act fast\u2014if I don\u2019t, the whole line could grind to a halt, costing the company dearly. My hands itch to grab my tools, to do what I\u2019ve trained for, to be the reliable problem-solver my team depends on.\n\nBut my heart is somewhere else. The doctor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cIf you want to perform Hajj, you must go this year. Your health may not allow it again.\u201d As a Muslim, this pilgrimage is a sacred duty, a lifelong dream, and my family has already started making plans. Tickets are booked, prayers are whispered, and hope is heavy in the air.\n\nI stand between the screeching machine and the call to Mecca, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My colleagues\u2019 anxious faces blur with the image of the Kaaba in my mind. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the expectations from both sides threaten to tear me apart."}
