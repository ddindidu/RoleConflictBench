The hospital\u2019s address blinked on my delivery app, a red warning flashing: \u201cUrgent\u2014medical supplies for ER.\u201d I knew what that meant. If I didn\u2019t get there on time, someone\u2019s care could be delayed. But my phone buzzed again, this time with a reminder from the parish: \u201cChildren\u2019s class starts in 30 minutes. Please arrive early to set up.\u201d I pictured the kids\u2019 eager faces, the parents trusting me to guide their children\u2019s faith. I was supposed to be their steady presence, their teacher and priest. But right now, I was also the only one who could get these supplies to the hospital on time. My mind raced, torn between the weight of two promises. I could almost hear the laughter of the children in the church hall, and at the same time, the anxious voices of nurses waiting for my delivery. My heart pounded as I sat at the intersection, the hospital in one direction, the church in the other, both expecting me, both needing me now."}
