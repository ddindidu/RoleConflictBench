The living room still needs vacuuming, and the bathroom mirror is streaked with toothpaste. My supervisor expects every surface to shine, even though most of my coworkers just do a quick sweep and call it a day. I want to do my job right, to leave the house spotless, but my mind keeps drifting to the Buddhist study circle meeting tonight. We\u2019re discussing a chapter I haven\u2019t even opened yet, and I know the others will expect thoughtful insights and questions. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014one demanding spotless floors, the other a clear, focused mind. My hands scrub harder, but my thoughts are tangled. If I stay late to clean thoroughly, I\u2019ll miss the study and let my spiritual practice slide. If I leave early, the house won\u2019t meet my own standards, and I\u2019ll disappoint my supervisor. The vacuum hums in my hand, but inside, I\u2019m wrestling with which part of myself to let down."}
