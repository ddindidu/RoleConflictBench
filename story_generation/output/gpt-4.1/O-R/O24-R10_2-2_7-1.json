I knew I had to review it thoroughly before tomorrow\u2019s session; the law demanded nothing less. Yet, as the sun dipped below the horizon, I glanced at the clock and felt a familiar tug. It was time for my evening ritual: lighting the lamp, offering flowers, and reciting prayers at my home altar. My faith taught me that these moments of devotion were not to be rushed or neglected, especially after a day of weighty decisions. But the legal brief sat on my desk, its pages crisp and unread, a silent reminder of my duty to stay current and impartial. My mind churned with anxiety\u2014if I delayed my prayers, I would feel unmoored, but if I postponed my legal review, I risked failing in my role as a judge. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat there, torn, the lamp unlit and the legal text unopened, wrestling with the impossible demands of both my worlds."}
