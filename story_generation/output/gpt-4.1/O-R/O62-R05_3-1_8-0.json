My mind, though, kept drifting to the blank page in my notebook\u2014sermon ideas for Shabbat. The congregation expected inspiration, wisdom, something meaningful. I owed them my best, and the pressure to deliver weighed on me. Suddenly, a splash caught my eye. A child, small and uncertain, had wandered into the deep end\u2014an area strictly off-limits for non-swimmers. My training screamed at me: enforce the rules, act fast, keep everyone safe. But as I stood, ready to intervene, my thoughts tangled. If I left my post even for a moment to jot down a sermon idea, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty as a lifeguard. Yet, if I focused only on the pool, I\u2019d lose precious time for reflection, risking a lackluster message for my community. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, heart pounding, as I watched the child\u2019s uncertain strokes."}
