The subject line read: \u201cUrgent: Tax Discrepancy Notice.\u201d My heart thudded. As the company\u2019s accountant, I knew the expectation\u2014respond immediately, ensure compliance, avoid penalties. I opened the attachment, scanning the details, my mind already racing through possible explanations and the documents I\u2019d need to gather.\n\nJust then, the distant sound of drums and laughter drifted through the window. I glanced outside and saw neighbors gathering, dressed in bright colors, the air thick with the scent of incense. Today was the start of Navratri, and my family expected me to join the prayers and help with the evening\u2019s puja. My mother had called earlier, reminding me to bring sweets and flowers.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of the tax notice pressing on my chest, while the pull of tradition and community tugged at my heart. I stood by the window, watching the festival unfold, my laptop screen glowing behind me, caught between the demands of my profession and the expectations of my faith."}
