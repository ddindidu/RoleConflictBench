The new case required a scheduling order, and the deadline loomed at the end of the week. As a judge, I was expected to be thorough and precise, my legal opinions and orders leaving no room for ambiguity. My mind raced with the details I needed to include, but my focus was broken by the memory of the communal event I\u2019d just attended. The catered food had looked delicious, but none of it was certified kosher. As a Jew, I was expected to observe dietary laws, a commitment I\u2019d never taken lightly. Yet, refusing to eat would have drawn attention, perhaps even seemed disrespectful to my colleagues. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my duty to the law, my devotion to my faith. The expectations clashed inside me, each demanding my loyalty, each unwilling to yield. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but my thoughts were tangled, wrestling with the impossible choice between clarity in my work and integrity in my beliefs."}
