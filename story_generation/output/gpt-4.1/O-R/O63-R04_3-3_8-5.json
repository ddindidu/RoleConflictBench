My headset pressed tight against my ears, the automated compliance system\u2019s red warning light pulsed in the corner of my screen. I knew if I left my desk even a minute early, the system would flag me, and another warning would go on my record. But today wasn\u2019t just any Friday. Down the street, the mosque was filling with people\u2014some had driven hours\u2014waiting for me to deliver the Khutbah for a milestone event in our community. My phone vibrated with a message from the mosque committee: \u201cEveryone\u2019s here. We\u2019re ready when you are.\u201d My heart pounded. I could picture the congregation, their expectations heavy on my shoulders, while the cold, unblinking system at work demanded I stay put until the clock struck noon. I stared at the time, torn between the rigid rules of my job and the spiritual responsibility I owed my community, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, waiting for me to choose."}
