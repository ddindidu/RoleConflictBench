As a police officer, I was expected to enforce the law, to quiet the disturbance and restore peace for the neighbors who had called in the complaint. But as I stepped out, my phone buzzed with a message from the church deacon: a family in our congregation had just lost their home in a fire, and they needed me\u2014Pastor Michael\u2014right now for comfort and guidance. I could picture the frightened children, the parents desperate for hope. My badge weighed heavy on my chest, but so did the collar I wore beneath my uniform. The partygoers watched me approach, expecting authority. The family across town waited for a shepherd. I stood on the sidewalk, torn between the duty to uphold the law and the calling to serve my flock, my heart pounding with the impossible choice before me."}
