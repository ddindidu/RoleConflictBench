Tomorrow, I start the biggest project of my career\u2014a custom library for the town\u2019s new community center. The client expects perfection, and I know I need to study every detail, every joint and angle, to make sure nothing goes wrong. But as I reached for my pencil, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Carter, an elderly neighbor who often struggles with loneliness. She asked if I could come by for a cup of tea\u2014she just needed someone to talk to. As a Christian, I believe in showing kindness, in being there for others, especially those who are alone. But the pressure of the project weighed on me. If I left my plans now, I might miss something crucial, risk disappointing my client, and jeopardize my reputation as a carpenter. Yet, if I ignored Mrs. Carter, I\u2019d be turning away from the compassion my faith calls me to show. My heart tugged in two directions, and I sat there, torn, unsure which path to take."}
