The package was marked \u201cconfidential\u201d and \u201chigh value\u201d\u2014the kind that required a signature and a photo ID. As I rang the bell, I rehearsed my lines, ready to verify every detail. The door opened, and before I could speak, Mrs. Carter\u2014one of my congregation\u2014stood there, her eyes red and tired. She barely glanced at the package. \u201cPastor, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here,\u201d she whispered, voice trembling. \u201cCan we talk? It\u2019s about my son. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\u201d \n\nMy delivery scanner buzzed in my pocket, reminding me of the strict protocol: no distractions, no exceptions. But Mrs. Carter\u2019s pain was raw, her need for comfort immediate. I felt the weight of the package in my hands and the heavier burden in my heart.

I stood there, torn, the demands of both worlds pressing in, unsure which duty to answer first."}
