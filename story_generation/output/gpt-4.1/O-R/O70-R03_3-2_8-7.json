It\u2019s late.\u201d My heart thudded. As a delivery person, I was expected to respond quickly, calmly, and with reassurance, even though I\u2019d just learned the package was misplaced at the depot. I started typing a polite reply, my mind racing for the right words to ease their frustration.\n\nJust then, my other phone buzzed\u2014a message from Sister Agnes. \u201cMaria, Mrs. Lopez is waiting in the chapel. She needs to talk about her crisis of faith.\u201d As a nun, I was expected to be present, compassionate, and fully engaged in spiritual reflection, especially for someone in need. I looked at the clock. My delivery shift overlapped with my scheduled time for spiritual study and parish support.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both uniforms pressing on me. The customer expected professionalism and answers; Mrs. Lopez needed my undivided empathy and spiritual guidance. My hands trembled as I stared at both screens, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds, each demanding all of me at the same moment."}
