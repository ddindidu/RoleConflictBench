I checked the route, calculating the fastest way through the evening traffic. Then my other phone vibrated\u2014a call from the church deacon. \u201cPastor, we need you. The Johnsons lost their home in the fire. People are gathering at the community hall, and they\u2019re asking for you.\u201d My heart clenched. As a pastor, I was expected to be there, to comfort, to lead in times of crisis. But right now, I was behind the wheel, responsible for a passenger who depended on me to get them where they needed to go. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each urgent in its own way. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the duty to my passenger and the call to serve my community, feeling the tension rise as I approached the next intersection, unsure which direction I would choose."}
