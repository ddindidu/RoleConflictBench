Tomorrow, I was to begin the largest project of my career\u2014a custom library for the town\u2019s new school. The plans were intricate, demanding my full attention. Every measurement, every joint, had to be perfect. Yet, as I traced the lines with my pencil, the church bell tolled in the distance, a reminder of the sacred holiday tomorrow. The congregation would gather in numbers unseen all year, expecting me to lead them in prayer, to offer guidance and comfort. My hands, skilled with wood, trembled as I imagined the faces looking to me for spiritual strength. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one by the promise of craftsmanship, the other by the weight of faith. Both roles demanded my presence, my heart, my best self. The blueprints blurred before my eyes as I wrestled with the impossible choice, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
