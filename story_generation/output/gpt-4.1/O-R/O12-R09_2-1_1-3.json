But it\u2019s already late, and my stomach growls. I reach for a snack, remembering the kosher crackers in my drawer. The office kitchen is full of tempting, non-kosher treats, but I stick to my own food, as I always do. \n\nStill, the pressure mounts. My team is counting on me to fix these issues before tomorrow\u2019s demo. I want to stay late, order dinner with everyone, and power through the night. But the only delivery options are pizza and burgers\u2014none kosher. If I leave to eat at home, I\u2019ll lose precious time. If I stay, I\u2019ll be hungry and distracted, maybe even tempted to compromise. The expectations pull at me from both sides: be the reliable developer, and the observant Jew. My hands hover over the keyboard, my mind racing, caught between the demands of my work and my faith."}
