As a nursing assistant, I knew how much she depended on me for bathing and dressing, especially since her arthritis had flared up again. My mind, though, kept drifting to the lesson I\u2019d planned for the children at the synagogue. It was my week to teach them about Shabbat traditions, and I\u2019d promised to bring in my grandmother\u2019s candlesticks to make the lesson special. The study slot could be moved, but the kids were so excited, and I felt responsible for nurturing their connection to our heritage.\n\nAs I reached Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s door, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the lesson. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. The staff was short-handed today, and I knew leaving early would put extra strain on my coworkers and possibly delay care for my patients. But the thought of disappointing the children, of letting down my community, weighed just as heavily. I stood outside the door, torn between the needs of my patients and the expectations of my faith, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me."}
