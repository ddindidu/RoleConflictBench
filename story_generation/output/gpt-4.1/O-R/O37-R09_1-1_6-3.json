The manager had reminded us again this morning: gloves must be worn for all chemical cleaning, no exceptions. But I\u2019d run out halfway through, and the next box was locked in the supply closet. I\u2019d finished the job barehanded, promising myself I\u2019d be careful. Now, as I reached for my lunch, I hesitated. The kosher snacks I\u2019d brought from home were waiting for me, but my hands didn\u2019t feel clean enough. Jewish law is clear\u2014food must remain pure, untouched by anything unclean. I could wash my hands, but would it be enough after the chemicals? My stomach growled, but my mind spun with worry. The expectation to keep everything hygienic at work clashed with my need to keep my food kosher. I stared at the sink, the soap, the gloves, and my lunch, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which rule I was about to break."}
