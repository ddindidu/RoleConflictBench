My hands were still smudged with grease from the last repair when I noticed the new staff gathering around the old press, their faces uncertain. They were about to start a batch, but I could see from their hesitant movements that they hadn\u2019t grasped the safety protocols I\u2019d tried to explain earlier. My duty as a machine repairer was clear: I needed to guide them, to prevent a disaster before it happened.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from Sister Agnes. A parishioner was waiting in the chapel, desperate to talk, her faith shaken and her heart heavy. As a nun, I was expected to offer comfort, to listen and help her find her way back to peace. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. The machines demanded my expertise, the parishioner my compassion. I stood frozen, torn between the clang of metal and the quiet sanctuary, my mind racing with the impossible choice before me."}
