My passenger, a nervous businessman, kept glancing at his watch and muttering about missing his international flight. I could feel his anxiety pressing on me, the unspoken demand to get him to the airport on time despite the treacherous conditions. My duty as a driver was clear: keep him safe, but also get him there as quickly as possible.\n\nMy phone buzzed on the dashboard. It was a message from Maria, a member of my congregation. Her words were desperate\u2014her marriage was falling apart, and she needed to talk to me right away. As her pastor, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and guidance. But I was stuck in this cab, responsible for the man in my back seat, the storm outside, and the clock ticking down to his departure.\n\nI felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and both needed me now. My hands tightened on the wheel as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
