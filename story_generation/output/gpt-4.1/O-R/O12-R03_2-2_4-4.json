Slack notifications kept popping up\u2014messages from the product team, the UX team, all waiting for my technical input. The deadline was tomorrow, and I knew the rest of the project hinged on my section. My mind raced with architecture diagrams and API endpoints, but the chapel bell interrupted my thoughts, its sound echoing down the stone hallway. Today, there was a special healing service for Sister Agnes, who had fallen gravely ill. The community expected my presence; prayer was not just a ritual, but a lifeline, especially now. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my colleagues counting on my expertise, my sisters counting on my prayers. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart torn between the urgent needs of my team and the sacred call to support my community. I closed my eyes, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
