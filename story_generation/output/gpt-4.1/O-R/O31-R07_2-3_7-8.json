As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, to listen carefully, gather facts, and make a just decision. My notepad felt heavy in my hand, but not as heavy as the knowledge that I was supposed to be at home, poring over the sutras. My Buddhist teacher had asked me to summarize key teachings for tomorrow\u2019s temple session\u2014a rare honor, and a responsibility I took to heart. The words of the Dhammapada echoed in my mind, urging me toward patience and reflection, but the demands of the moment pressed in. The drivers looked to me for resolution, while my mind drifted to the unfinished notes on impermanence and compassion. I felt torn, the weight of duty and devotion pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which path to follow as the sun dipped lower behind the city skyline."}
