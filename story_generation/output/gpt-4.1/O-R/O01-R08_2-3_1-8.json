The structural calculations for the new community center didn\u2019t add up\u2014if we didn\u2019t reinforce the beams, the building could be unsafe. As the lead architect, it was my duty to halt construction until the issues were fixed. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the Hajj application deadline was tomorrow. My doctor\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014my health was declining, and this year might be my last chance to fulfill my lifelong dream as a Muslim. My team and the clients expected me to oversee every detail of the project, especially now, when safety was at stake. But my heart ached at the thought of missing Hajj, a pillar of my faith. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. If I left now, would I be neglecting my duty to protect others? If I stayed, would I lose my only chance to answer the call to pilgrimage? My hands trembled as I stared at the calendar, caught between two worlds, unable to move."}
