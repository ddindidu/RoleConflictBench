My manager\u2019s email blinked on my screen: \u201cWe need your estimates by noon. The client won\u2019t sign until we have them.\u201d I knew the project\u2019s success\u2014and my team\u2019s trust\u2014rested on my calculations. Yet, as I reached for my calculator, my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes. \u201cMaria is waiting in the chapel. She needs you. She\u2019s struggling with her faith.\u201d My heart twisted. As a nun, I was called to offer guidance, to listen and comfort those in spiritual need. Maria\u2019s pain was real, and I could not ignore her. But the project\u2019s timeline was inflexible, and my absence would delay everything. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The expectations of my colleagues and my spiritual family clashed within me, each demanding my presence, my care, my expertise. I closed my eyes, torn between the numbers on my screen and the soul waiting in the chapel, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
