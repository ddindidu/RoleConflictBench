They were about to start a batch, but I could see from their confusion that they hadn\u2019t grasped the safety protocols I\u2019d explained earlier.

It was a message from the mosque\u2014someone had arrived, desperate for spiritual counsel after a devastating loss. As the imam, I was expected to offer comfort and guidance, to be present in moments of crisis. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my immediate attention.
