Two travelers approached, their arms full of heavy suitcases, and asked if I could help them load their bags and take them across town. They seemed tired and grateful, mentioning they would split the fare. As a taxi driver, I knew I should offer them professional service\u2014help with their luggage, a safe ride, and a welcoming attitude. But my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee: the gathering had grown larger than expected, and no one else was authorized to lead the prayer. The community was waiting for me, expecting guidance and spiritual leadership. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my duty to serve these travelers with kindness and my responsibility to my congregation, who looked to me for direction and comfort. My heart pounded as I stood between the open trunk and the call to prayer, torn by the demands of both worlds, unsure which path to take."}
