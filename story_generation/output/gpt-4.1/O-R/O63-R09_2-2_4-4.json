My manager\u2019s reminders echoed in my head: \u201cPush through the last hour, every call counts.\u201d I dialed number after number, my voice growing hoarse, stomach rumbling with hunger. I hadn\u2019t eaten since breakfast, and the vending machine\u2019s snacks weren\u2019t kosher. I glanced at my phone, checking the map for food options. Only one small vendor nearby was kosher-certified, and they\u2019d close soon. If I left now, I\u2019d miss precious calling time and risk missing my target. If I stayed, I\u2019d go hungry, betraying the care I put into keeping kosher. My headset pressed against my ear, the next call ringing, while my mind spun with guilt and anxiety. I felt torn\u2014between the pressure to perform at work and the commitment to my faith, both demanding more than I could give at once."}
