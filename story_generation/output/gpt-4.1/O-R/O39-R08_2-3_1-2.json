The carpenter waved, impatience clear in his stance\u2014he needed this load to keep the project moving. My foreman\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo delays, everyone\u2019s counting on you.\u201d I wanted to do my job well, to be reliable, to not let the team down. But as I stacked the boards, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the community study circle was tonight. I hadn\u2019t read the assigned verses from the Quran yet. I was supposed to recite and reflect, to come prepared and contribute. My brothers and sisters in faith would expect me to be ready, to show respect for the words of Allah. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my hands rough from labor, my heart heavy with guilt. I glanced at the clock, torn between the demands of my work and the expectations of my faith, unsure which duty I could afford to let down."}
