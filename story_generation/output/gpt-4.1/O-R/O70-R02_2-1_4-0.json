The label read \u201cSignature Required.\u201d My phone buzzed with a reminder: daily prayer service at the chapel in twenty minutes. As a delivery person, I knew the rules\u2014no shortcuts, no leaving packages without a signature, especially for items like this. Mrs. Kim\u2019s building was notorious for missed deliveries, and I could already imagine her frustration if I failed to get her signature today.\n\nBut as a priest, I felt the weight of my community\u2019s expectations. Even though today\u2019s prayer was routine and technically optional, I knew some of the elderly parishioners relied on these moments for comfort. They\u2019d be waiting, expecting me to lead them in prayer, to be present and attentive.\n\nMy hands tightened on the steering wheel. If I waited for Mrs. Kim, I\u2019d be late for the service. If I left now, I\u2019d have to break protocol and risk the package. Both roles demanded my presence, my responsibility. I sat there, torn, the minutes ticking by, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
