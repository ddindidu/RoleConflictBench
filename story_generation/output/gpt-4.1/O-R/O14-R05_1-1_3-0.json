The latest batch of data from the experiment blinked on my screen, waiting to be logged. As a scientist, I knew the importance of accuracy\u2014every detail mattered, and the integrity of my research depended on timely, precise documentation. Still, the logs could wait until tomorrow; the schedule was flexible, and nothing would be lost if I delayed.\n\nYet, as a rabbi, my mind tugged in another direction. Shabbat was weeks away, but the congregation expected a thoughtful, relevant sermon. Inspiration didn\u2019t always strike on command, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d start brainstorming early this time. The pressure to offer wisdom, to guide and uplift, pressed on me. I could almost hear the expectant hush of the sanctuary, the faces turned toward me, waiting.\n\nI stared at the blinking cursor, feeling the weight of both worlds. Should I honor the discipline of my scientific work, or nurture the spiritual needs of my community? The demands pulled at me, each urgent in its own way, and I sat, paralyzed, caught between two callings."}
