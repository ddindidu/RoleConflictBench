The client\u2019s questions were simple, but I could sense their anxiety, and I wanted to reassure them\u2014after all, part of my job was making sure they felt confident and supported. Just as I finished explaining the safety lock, my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. \u201cCan you talk? I really need guidance,\u201d she wrote. I knew she\u2019d been struggling with a major decision, and as her pastor, she expected me to listen deeply and offer spiritual wisdom. My mind raced. The client was still on the line, waiting for more advice, but Sarah\u2019s message weighed heavily on my heart. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one demanding technical clarity, the other emotional presence. My hands trembled slightly as I tried to decide which voice to answer first, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me."}
