I glance at my sales dashboard\u2014my numbers are soaring, and I\u2019m on track to break my personal record. Management\u2019s emails keep pinging in, full of praise and reminders to keep pushing. Every call I make, every pitch I deliver, I can almost hear the bonus jingling in my pocket. But as I close another sale, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the holiday is this weekend. The kids are counting on me to teach them the blessings, the stories, the melodies that my parents once taught me. I promised them we\u2019d practice tonight, but my manager just asked if I could stay late to help the team. My mind races\u2014if I say yes, I\u2019ll be the office hero, but I\u2019ll let my family down. If I say no, I\u2019ll keep my promise at home, but risk disappointing my boss. The weight of both worlds presses in, and I sit frozen, headset in hand, torn between the expectations of my job and the traditions I hold dear."}
