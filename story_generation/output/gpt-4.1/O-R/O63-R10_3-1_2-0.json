Why should I trust this new offer? Explain it to me\u2014now.\u201d My training as a telemarketer kicks in: stay calm, answer every question, never let frustration show. But as the customer\u2019s barrage continues, my mind drifts to the small altar at home, the incense I forgot to light, the mantras I\u2019ve been whispering under my breath between calls. I know I should have performed the full morning puja, but the pressure to meet my sales quota left me with only seconds to spare. Now, as I try to soothe the customer, guilt gnaws at me. Am I failing my duty to my faith by cutting corners? Am I failing my job by letting my mind wander? The customer\u2019s voice grows louder, demanding answers, while inside, my own questions echo just as urgently."}
