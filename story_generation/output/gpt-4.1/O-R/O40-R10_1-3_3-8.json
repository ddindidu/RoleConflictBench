My client expected a quick turnaround, and I needed to estimate the materials and place the order today to meet the deadline. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the annual festival at my family\u2019s ancestral temple was tomorrow, a day\u2019s journey away. As a Hindu, it was my duty to be there, to join my relatives in rituals and offerings, to honor our traditions. My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, urging me not to miss the ceremonies this year. Yet, the thought of leaving the project unfinished gnawed at me. If I delayed the order, I risked disappointing my client and damaging my reputation as a reliable carpenter. But if I stayed, I would let down my family and my faith. My hands trembled as I stared at the unfinished plans, torn between the demands of my craft and the call of my heritage, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
