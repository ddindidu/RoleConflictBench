Months of calculations and patient waiting had led to this: a rare atmospheric window, perhaps my only chance to gather the data that could finally validate my hypothesis. The funding committee would meet next week, and without this evidence, my research might be shelved for good. I glanced at the clock\u2014forty minutes until the children would gather in the parish hall, their parents trusting me to guide them in faith and tradition. I was expected to lead the class, to nurture their questions and teach them stories of hope. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cSet up for religious education.\u201d My hands trembled as I set up the experiment, knowing that if I left now, the opportunity would vanish. But if I stayed, I would let down the families who counted on me, who saw me as a shepherd for their children\u2019s souls. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, each demanding my presence, each a calling I could not ignore."}
