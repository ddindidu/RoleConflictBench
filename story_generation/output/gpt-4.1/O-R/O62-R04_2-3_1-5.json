The sun was high, and the pool was crowded\u2014my responsibility was clear: every swimmer\u2019s safety depended on my vigilance. Yet, my phone buzzed with reminders from the mosque committee. Today was not just any Friday; it was the day of our community\u2019s long-awaited milestone, and I was to deliver the sermon. People had come from distant towns, eager to hear my words, expecting guidance and inspiration. My heart pounded as I spotted a swimmer flailing near the middle of the pool, their distress unmistakable. I gripped the armrest, torn. If I left now, I\u2019d abandon my post and risk someone\u2019s life. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down my congregation, who had placed their trust in me for this special day. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to yield. My mind raced, caught between the urgent cries of duty and the silent pull of faith, knowing that whatever I chose, something vital would be left unattended."}
