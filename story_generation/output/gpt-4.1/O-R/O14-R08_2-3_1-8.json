The lab had finally approved my experiment slot\u2014just one week with the rare isotope detector, a window I\u2019d waited years for. My team expected me to lead, to gather the data that could change our field. But the same week, my family was preparing for Hajj. The doctor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cIf you want to go, this is your chance. Your health may not allow it again.\u201d As a Muslim, performing Hajj is a sacred duty, a lifelong dream. My parents\u2019 hopeful faces, the tickets already booked, the prayers we\u2019d whispered together. Yet, my colleagues\u2019 trust, the grant money, the months of planning\u2014all depended on me. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing on my chest. I tried to pray for clarity, but my mind kept circling back to the lab, to Mecca, to the fear of letting someone down no matter what I chose."}
