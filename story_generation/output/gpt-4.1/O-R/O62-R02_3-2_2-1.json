The beach was packed\u2014families, children, teenagers daring the surf. As a lifeguard, I knew that even a second\u2019s distraction could mean disaster. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder: the main weekly service was about to begin. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, offer comfort, and be the spiritual anchor for everyone. I pictured the congregation gathering, waiting for me to open the service, their faith in me as strong as the undertow I watched for in the water. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles. If I left my post, I risked the safety of the swimmers. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down my community, who counted on me for guidance and hope. The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I stood frozen, torn between the call of duty and the call of faith, unable to move as the minutes ticked by."}
