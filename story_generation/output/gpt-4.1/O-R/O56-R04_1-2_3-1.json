I nodded, comb in hand, but my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the mosque committee. The regular backup imam was out sick, and the congregation was gathering, expecting me to lead the prayer in just fifteen minutes. My heart thudded. Mrs. Rahim deserved my full attention, her satisfaction was my pride as a hairdresser. But as an imam, I knew the community relied on me, especially today.
