A few regulars trickle in, and I greet them with a smile, making small talk as I bag their groceries. My manager expects me to be cheerful and attentive, to make every customer feel welcome, even on slow days like this. But my mind drifts to the monastery, where the annual festival is about to begin. The monks and laypeople are gathering, preparing offerings and decorations before sunrise. I promised to help, to be present and mindful, to honor my commitment as a Buddhist and support my community. Yet here I am, tied to my shift, feeling the weight of both worlds. My heart aches with guilt\u2014if I leave, I let down my coworkers and customers; if I stay, I break my promise to the sangha. The register drawer slides open, and I force another smile, torn between the gentle hum of the store and the distant chanting I can almost hear."}
