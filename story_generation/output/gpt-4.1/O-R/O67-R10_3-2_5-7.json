Today was my niece\u2019s mundan, a sacred family ceremony I had promised never to miss. My mother\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cYou must be there, beta. It\u2019s your duty.\u201d But as I turned the ambulance key, the radio crackled\u2014an emergency call. A man, mid-fifties, severe chest pain, barely conscious. My training kicked in: every second counts with a heart attack. I sped through the streets, siren wailing, my mind torn. My family expected me at the temple, to chant, to bless, to be present. My duty as a Hindu was clear. But the uniform on my back demanded something else: to save a life, to offer care, to put the patient first. My hands gripped the wheel tighter, heart pounding, as I wrestled with the impossible choice between my faith and my calling."}
