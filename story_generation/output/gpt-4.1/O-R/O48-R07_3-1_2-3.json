My patient, Mrs. Lee, winces as she tries to lift her spoon, her hand trembling with pain. I know she needs help, and my training urges me to be present, to assist her with compassion and efficiency. Yet, in just a few minutes, I am supposed to begin my daily ten-minute meditation, a quiet window I promised myself I would never skip, no matter how busy the ward becomes.\n\nThe expectation to be fully present for my patients tugs at me, but so does the vow to nurture my own mindfulness, to find peace in the chaos. I feel my breath catch, my mind torn between the suffering in front of me and the sanctuary I crave within. The sounds of the ward fade as I stand at the crossroads, heart pounding, wrestling with the impossible choice between serving another and honoring myself."}
