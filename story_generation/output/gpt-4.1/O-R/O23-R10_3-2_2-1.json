My client was counting on me to catch any hidden pitfalls, especially the clauses that could cost them dearly if I missed something. The clock ticked closer to dusk, and I knew I had only a short window to review the documents before the deadline. Yet, as the sun dipped lower, I felt the familiar tug of my other life\u2014my faith. It was time for my daily puja, the moment to light the lamp and offer prayers at my home altar, a ritual that brought me peace and connected me to something greater than myself. My family expected me to uphold this tradition, and I felt the weight of their silent anticipation. The contract\u2019s urgency pressed on me, but so did the sacredness of my evening ritual. My mind raced, torn between the demands of my profession and the expectations of my faith, each pulling me in opposite directions as I sat, paralyzed, unable to choose."}
