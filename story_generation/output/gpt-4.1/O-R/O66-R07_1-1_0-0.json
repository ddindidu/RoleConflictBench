The sun was dipping low, and I knew the temple\u2019s evening chant would begin soon. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be there, to join the community in reciting the sutras, to show my devotion and presence. But as a taxi driver, my duty was to this passenger, who slid into the back seat with a relaxed smile, mentioning he was just heading to a casual dinner with friends\u2014no rush, he said, take your time.\n\nMy hands tightened on the steering wheel. If I drove him now, I\u2019d miss the start of the chant, maybe all of it. But if I turned him away, I\u2019d be letting down someone who trusted me to get him where he needed to go, safely and on time. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the temple\u2019s gentle expectation of my presence, the passenger\u2019s trust in my service. I sat for a moment, heart thumping, caught between the quiet call of the sangha and the immediate need of the man in my back seat."}
