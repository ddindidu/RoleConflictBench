As a taxi driver, I prided myself on keeping my cab spotless, a small sanctuary of order in the city\u2019s chaos. But today, she was crying, her tears falling onto the seat, her makeup smudging against the headrest. I felt a pang of worry for the upholstery, but even more for her. She recognized me not just as her driver, but as her pastor. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she whispered, voice trembling. \u201cCan you help me?\u201d \n\nI knew she needed more than a ride\u2014she needed spiritual guidance, a listening ear, a gentle word. But the meter was running, and I had other fares to consider. My company expected efficiency and professionalism, and I couldn\u2019t let my cab become a counseling office. Yet, as her pastor, I was called to be present, to offer comfort and wisdom, no matter the setting. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, torn between the duty to my job and the calling of my faith, the expectations of my employer and the needs of my flock."}
