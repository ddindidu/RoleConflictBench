As a telemarketer, I stared at the sales dashboard\u2014just a few more calls, a few more sales, and we\u2019d hit the quarterly target. Management\u2019s emails flashed urgent reminders: every call counts, every minute matters. My bonus, and the team\u2019s, hung in the balance. The phone rang again, but this time it was my parishioner, Mrs. Evans. She sounded hesitant, asking if I might have time to talk, not now, but soon\u2014she just needed some guidance, she said, her voice trembling. As a priest, I knew the expectation: to be present, to listen, to offer comfort whenever it\u2019s needed, not just when it\u2019s convenient. My mind raced. If I paused to reassure her, I\u2019d lose precious minutes, maybe miss my targets. But if I brushed her off, I\u2019d fail her in her moment of need. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other. I gripped the phone, heart pounding, caught between the urgent demands of my job and the quiet, persistent call of my vocation."}
