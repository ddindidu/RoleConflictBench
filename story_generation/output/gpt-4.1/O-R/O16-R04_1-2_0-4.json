My patient, a middle-aged man with a persistent cough and runny nose, sat across from me, expecting reassurance and clarity. As a doctor, I owed him a thorough diagnosis, even if his symptoms seemed like a simple cold. I listened to his chest, asked about his history, and considered the possibility of something more serious. Yet, my mind kept drifting to the mosque, where I was scheduled to deliver the Friday sermon in less than an hour. The community had been looking forward to my talk, and as the only imam available today, I knew I couldn\u2019t let them down. The pressure mounted\u2014my patient needed careful attention, but so did my congregation. I felt torn, my heart pounding with the knowledge that I couldn\u2019t fully meet the expectations of both roles at this moment."}
