The app pinged again\u2014my passenger, impatient, messaged: \u201cPlease hurry, I\u2019m late!\u201d I was only five minutes away, but traffic was thick, and every red light felt like a personal failure. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on punctuality and calm, knowing my passengers counted on me to get them where they needed to be, especially in moments like this.\n\nBut my phone vibrated with another message, this one from the mosque committee: \u201cBackup imam is sick. Can you lead Maghrib? Everyone\u2019s waiting.\u201d My heart thudded. The congregation expected me to guide them in prayer, to be present, composed, and focused. I pictured the rows of worshippers, their trust in me, the sacred responsibility I carried as their imam.\n\nCaught between the urgent needs of a passenger and the spiritual needs of my community, I felt torn in two. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, mind racing, as I tried to weigh which duty I could bear to let down."}
