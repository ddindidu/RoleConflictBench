Mrs. Patel had just come out of surgery and needed help getting dressed before her family arrived. As a nursing assistant, I knew I had to be gentle and thorough, making sure she was comfortable and safe. But today was Friday, and the call to prayer echoed softly from my phone. I was expected in the main prayer hall soon, and as a Muslim, I needed to be dressed modestly and presentable for the congregational worship.\n\nMy uniform sleeves were short, and I hadn\u2019t brought my long cardigan in the rush of the morning. If I helped Mrs. Patel now, I\u2019d have no time to change before prayer. But if I left her waiting, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to her care. The weight of both expectations pressed on me\u2014my responsibility to my patient and my commitment to my faith. I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, torn between the needs of my patient and the call to prayer, unsure which path to take."}
