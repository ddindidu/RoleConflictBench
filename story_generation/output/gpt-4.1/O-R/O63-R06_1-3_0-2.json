The day had been smooth\u2014most callers were polite, and the script handled their questions with ease. Then, my screen flashed with a new lead. I dialed, and a frail voice answered. She explained she was on a fixed income, barely making ends meet, but she was interested in the product. My training kicked in: handle objections, highlight benefits, close the sale. But as she hesitated, I heard the worry in her voice. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t let them off the line. Push through.\u201d Yet, my heart ached. As a Christian, I was taught to care for the vulnerable, to act with honesty and compassion. Was it right to persuade her to spend money she clearly didn\u2019t have?
