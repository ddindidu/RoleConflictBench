As a lawyer, I was expected to review every clause, every line, ensuring nothing slipped through that could harm my client. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the office function was this afternoon. I glanced at my reflection in the window, my modest attire standing out in a workplace where most dressed differently. As a Muslim, I was committed to dressing according to my faith, but I knew the office function would be filled with colleagues of all genders, some of whom had already commented on my clothing choices in the past. The pressure to fit in, to be seen as approachable and part of the team, pressed against my commitment to my beliefs. My mind raced, torn between the urgent legal work demanding my focus and the anxiety of attending the function, knowing my appearance might once again set me apart. I felt the weight of both roles, each with its own expectations, pulling me in different directions as the afternoon approached."}
