The package I was supposed to deliver had just arrived\u2014later than I\u2019d hoped, but still within today. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cCustomers expect their deliveries on time, no excuses.\u201d I loaded the box into my van, feeling the familiar pressure to meet every deadline. But as I checked the address, my heart sank. If I left now, I\u2019d miss my evening puja. Every day, I set aside this sacred time for prayers, chanting, and offerings. It\u2019s not just a habit\u2014it\u2019s a promise I made to myself and to my faith, never to skip a ritual, no matter what. My family expects it, and so do I. Yet, the customer expects their package, and my job depends on it. I sat in the driver\u2019s seat, torn between the ticking clock of my delivery route and the silent call of my altar at home. My hands trembled on the steering wheel as I weighed the demands of my work against the devotion that shapes my every day."}
