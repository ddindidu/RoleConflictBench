The filing deadline loomed, and I knew my firm was counting on me to catch any errors or loopholes before the documents went to court. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the monthly food drive at the convent was starting in fifteen minutes. As a nun, I was expected to be there, helping to organize donations and serve meals to the homeless. The sisters relied on my presence, and the people we served looked forward to my smile and conversation. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my duty to my clients, who trusted my legal expertise, and toward my calling to serve those in need. The clock ticked louder, echoing the tension inside me. I stared at the contract, then at my habit hanging on the door, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
