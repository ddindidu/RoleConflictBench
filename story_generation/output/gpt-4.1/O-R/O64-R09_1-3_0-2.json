My mind keeps drifting to my son, who\u2019s struggling with his Torah portion for his upcoming bar mitzvah. As a parent and a Jew, I know how important it is to guide him, to make sure he understands not just the words, but the meaning behind them. I promised him we\u2019d practice together today, but my shift was extended last minute. The beep of the scanner pulls me back\u2014each item, each total, each receipt, all needing my full attention. I can\u2019t afford mistakes; my manager expects accuracy, and customers expect speed. But every minute I spend here is a minute lost with my son, a minute he could be learning, a minute I could be teaching. The weight of both roles presses on me, and I feel torn, standing at the register, caught between the demands of my job and the responsibility I feel to my faith and my family."}
