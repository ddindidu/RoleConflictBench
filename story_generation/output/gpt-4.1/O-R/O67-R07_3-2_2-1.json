Tonight\u2019s memorial service was important\u2014our community would gather, and as a practicing Buddhist, I was expected to help lead the chanting and offer support to grieving families. I had promised the abbot I would be there early, dressed in my white robe, ready to light incense and recite prayers. But the dispatcher\u2019s urgent voice cut through my thoughts: a multi-vehicle collision on the highway, multiple injuries, critical response needed. My hands trembled as I reached for my keys. The ambulance bay lights flickered above me, reminding me of my duty to save lives, to respond without hesitation. Yet, my heart pulled me toward the temple, where my presence was also needed, where compassion was expressed in stillness and ritual. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me\u2014one demanding immediate action, the other quiet devotion. I stood frozen, torn between the wail of sirens and the soft chime of temple bells, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
