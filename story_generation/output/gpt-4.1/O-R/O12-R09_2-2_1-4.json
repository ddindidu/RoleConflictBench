I know I should stay late, fix the issues, and prove I\u2019m reliable. But my stomach growls, reminding me I haven\u2019t eaten since morning. I\u2019m traveling for work, and the only kosher-certified vendor nearby closes soon. If I miss it, I\u2019ll have nothing to eat until tomorrow. The pressure mounts: my team\u2019s trust on one side, my commitment to kosher on the other. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding something I can\u2019t give to the other. My hands hover over the keyboard, torn between pushing through the code and rushing out for a meal I can actually eat. The clock ticks, and I can\u2019t ignore the gnawing hunger or the responsibility to my team. I close my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, wishing I could split myself in two."}
