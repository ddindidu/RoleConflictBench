My phone buzzed with the latest pharmacy newsletter\u2014new drug approvals, safety alerts, clinical updates. I knew I needed to stay sharp, to keep up with the ever-changing world of medicine. My patients depended on me to know the latest, to catch interactions, to offer the best advice. I scrolled quickly, eyes darting over headlines, feeling the weight of professional responsibility settle on my shoulders.\n\nThen, my phone vibrated again\u2014a gentle reminder from the temple group. The evening chant would begin soon. As a Buddhist, I was expected to join, to be present with my community, to help create the calm and mindful space we all cherished. The ritual was more than tradition; it was a grounding, a way to nurture compassion and clarity. But the newsletter still glowed in my hand, full of information I couldn\u2019t ignore.\n\nI felt the tension coil in my chest. My mind tugged in two directions: the duty to my patients, the call to my spiritual community. I stared at the screen, heart pounding, caught between the demands of knowledge and the pull of presence."}
