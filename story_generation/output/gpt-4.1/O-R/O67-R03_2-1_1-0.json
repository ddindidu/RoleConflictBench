Today was the monthly food drive, and I\u2019d promised to help prepare and serve meals for the homeless. It was a commitment I cherished, a chance to live out my vows through service and compassion. But the dispatcher\u2019s voice cut through my thoughts: \u201cAmbulance 3, respond to a possible broken leg, Main and 5th. Moderate traffic.\u201d My heart skipped. As an ambulance driver, I knew every second mattered. Someone was in pain, waiting for help only I could bring. Yet, as a nun, my community counted on me to be present, to serve with humility and love. I could almost hear Sister Agnes\u2019s gentle reminder: \u201cWe are the hands of Christ today.\u201d The keys felt heavy in my palm. I stood at the crossroads of duty and devotion, torn between the urgent call of the city and the quiet promise I\u2019d made to my sisters and the hungry. My mind raced, wrestling with the weight of both uniforms I wore, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
