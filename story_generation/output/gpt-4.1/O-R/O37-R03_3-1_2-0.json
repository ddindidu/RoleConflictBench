As the housekeeping cleaner, I am responsible for deep cleaning every room today\u2014scrubbing floors, sanitizing bathrooms, dusting every corner until the house gleams. Sister Agnes reminded me last night that the Mother Superior expects nothing less than perfection, especially before the bishop\u2019s visit. Yet, as a nun, my heart is pulled toward the food drive scheduled for this afternoon. The community depends on us; the faces of the homeless who wait for our meals linger in my mind. I feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014one demanding spotless order, the other calling for compassion and presence. My hands ache from scrubbing, but my spirit aches more, torn between the silent, meticulous work of cleaning and the noisy, urgent call to serve. The clock ticks on, and I stand in the hallway, mop in hand, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
