My mind was focused on the responsibility of driving safely\u2014every bump, every turn, every pedestrian mattered. The flashing lights were off, but the weight of the vehicle and the trust placed in me pressed on my shoulders. As I neared the church, my phone buzzed urgently. A parishioner, voice trembling, pleaded for help\u2014someone had arrived at the church in deep emotional crisis, desperate for spiritual guidance. My heart clenched. As a priest, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and counsel in moments of despair. But as an ambulance driver, I couldn\u2019t abandon my post or risk a reckless drive. The expectations of both roles collided within me, each demanding my immediate presence, each carrying consequences if neglected. I gripped the steering wheel tighter, torn between the duty to protect lives on the road and the call to heal a soul in pain, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds as I approached the intersection."}
