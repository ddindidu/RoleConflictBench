Holiday travel always brings this chaos, and as the lead controller, I\u2019m expected to keep the airspace safe, efficient, and calm. My headset crackles with pilots\u2019 voices, each requesting updates, fuel checks, and revised clearances. My supervisor\u2019s eyes flick to the clock; delays are mounting, and every minute counts.\n\nBut the clock means something else to me, too. In fifteen minutes, my Buddhist meditation group will gather in the quiet room down the hall. I promised myself I\u2019d join them this week, to sit in stillness, to breathe, to let go of the stress that clings to me like static. My teacher says mindfulness is not just for the cushion, but I crave the hour of silence, the gentle bell, the shared intention.\n\nYet here I am, heart pounding, mind racing, torn between the urgent demands of the airspace and the quiet call of the sangha. I stare at the screen, feeling the weight of responsibility and the pull of my own longing for peace, uncertain which voice to heed."}
