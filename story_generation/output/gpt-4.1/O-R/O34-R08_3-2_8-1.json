An emergency diversion flashes across three sectors, and I\u2019m instantly on high alert, coordinating with two other controllers to reroute traffic and keep the skies safe. My hands move quickly, my mind racing to anticipate every possible conflict. But as I issue instructions, a pang of guilt tugs at me. It\u2019s Ramadan\u2019s midpoint, and I\u2019m already behind on my daily Quran reading. I promised myself I\u2019d catch up tonight, to recite and reflect as I should, but the shift is relentless. The expectation to be vigilant, precise, and responsive as an air traffic controller clashes with my spiritual commitment. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014lives depend on my focus, but my heart aches for the peace and fulfillment I find in the Quran. The clock ticks, the radio crackles, and I\u2019m caught between the demands of the airspace and the quiet call of my faith, unsure which voice to answer first."}
