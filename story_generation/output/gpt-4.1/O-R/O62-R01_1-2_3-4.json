Not a safety hazard, but I knew the facility manager expected everything to be orderly. I knelt to straighten one, feeling the weight of my lifeguard duties\u2014every detail mattered, even the small ones. Just then, I heard my name. I turned to see Mrs. Carter, her face drawn and eyes red. She hesitated, then quietly asked if I had a moment. As a pastor, I knew what that meant\u2014she needed someone to listen, to offer comfort and guidance. My mind raced. The pool needed to look perfect, but Mrs. Carter needed me, too. I felt the tension coil in my chest, torn between the silent expectation to keep the facility pristine and the deeper call to support someone in pain. I glanced at the chairs, then back at her, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in, unsure which to answer first."}
