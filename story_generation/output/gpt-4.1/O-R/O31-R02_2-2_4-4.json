My radio crackled with updates, and I kept my voice steady, reassuring shaken drivers and making sure the paramedics had space to work. As a police officer, my duty was clear: protect everyone here, keep the scene safe, and restore order. But as I glanced at my watch, a knot tightened in my stomach. In less than fifteen minutes, I was supposed to meet with Mrs. Carter at the church\u2014she\u2019d finally gathered the courage to talk about her son\u2019s addiction, and she needed me as her priest, not as a cop. I could almost hear her voice, trembling with hope and fear, waiting for comfort and guidance. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me. If I left now, I\u2019d abandon my post and risk chaos at the accident. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down someone who trusted me with her pain. The sirens wailed, and I stood at the crossroads, torn between the badge on my chest and the collar at my neck, unable to silence the demands of either calling."}
