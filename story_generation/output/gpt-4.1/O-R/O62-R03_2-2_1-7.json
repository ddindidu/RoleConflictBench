As a lifeguard, I knew every second counted; I couldn\u2019t let my attention waver, not even for a moment. Suddenly, I noticed a swimmer in the middle of the pool, their strokes growing frantic. My muscles tensed, ready to leap in if needed. Just then, Sister Agnes approached, her voice gentle but urgent. \u201cSister, Mrs. Callahan is here. She\u2019s in tears and needs your guidance\u2014she says she\u2019s losing her faith.\u201d My heart twisted. As a nun, I was expected to offer comfort, to listen and guide those in spiritual distress. But as a lifeguard, I couldn\u2019t leave my post, not with someone struggling in the water. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, the whistle and the rosary beads cold against my skin. I felt torn, pulled by the desperate needs of two souls, each expecting me to be wholly present for them. My mind raced, caught between the call to save a life and the call to save a soul, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
