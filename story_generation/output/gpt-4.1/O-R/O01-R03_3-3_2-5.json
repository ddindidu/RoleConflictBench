As an architect, I knew the hospital project\u2019s final inspection was tomorrow. Every detail had to be perfect\u2014lives depended on it. My phone buzzed with reminders: check the fire exits, review the structural reports, confirm the sprinkler system. The city\u2019s safety inspector would accept no excuses, and neither would I. Yet, as a nun, my heart was pulled elsewhere. Mother Superior had chosen me to lead tonight\u2019s prayer vigil, a rare honor. The entire convent was counting on me to represent our faith and devotion at the cathedral. The event overlapped with the last window I had to review the hospital site before inspection. I felt torn, my mind racing between the sacred duty of prayer and the secular duty of safety. Both roles demanded my full presence, both were matters of life and spirit. I closed my eyes, feeling the tension coil inside me, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
