The client wanted efficiency, and I prided myself on delivering it. Just as I was finalizing the break room layout, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She sounded distraught, asking if I had time to talk. I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her pastor, I felt a deep responsibility to offer comfort and guidance.\n\nBut the deadline for the office design loomed, and my client had already expressed frustration over delays. If I stepped away now, I risked falling behind, jeopardizing my reputation as a reliable architect. Yet, if I ignored Sarah\u2019s plea, I\u2019d be failing her in her moment of need, betraying the trust she placed in me as her pastor. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the demands of my profession and the call of my faith, the weight of both roles pressing in on me as I tried to decide what to do next."}
