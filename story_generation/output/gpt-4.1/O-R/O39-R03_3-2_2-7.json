The foreman shouts, \u201cWe need you here\u2014now!\u201d The steel beam sways above, and I know I must help guide it into place before it\u2019s secured. My hands are calloused from days like this, and I feel the weight of my coworkers\u2019 expectations pressing on me. But my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a message from Sister Agnes. \u201cMaria, Mrs. Larkin is waiting in the chapel. She needs you.\u201d Mrs. Larkin, lost in her crisis of faith, is seeking comfort and guidance, and I am the one she trusts.
