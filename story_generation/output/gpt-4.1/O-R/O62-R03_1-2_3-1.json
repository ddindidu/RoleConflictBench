As a lifeguard, I was expected to keep everything in order, so I scanned the deck and noticed a few pool chairs out of line. They weren\u2019t broken, just a little askew, but I knew the supervisor expected everything to be perfect. I started to straighten them, but my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from Sister Agnes. The family next door had lost their home to a fire last night. The convent was gathering food and clothing, and they needed me to help organize donations and comfort the children. My heart ached for them; as a nun, I was called to serve, to be present in moments of crisis. But the pool was opening soon, and I was the only lifeguard on duty. I stood there, torn, the weight of my whistle around my neck and my rosary in my pocket, feeling the pull of two worlds that needed me at the same time."}
