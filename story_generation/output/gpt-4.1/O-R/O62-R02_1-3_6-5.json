My job was clear: keep everyone safe, enforce the rules, and make sure no one entered the shallow area unsupervised. Lately, swimmers had been slipping past the ropes, laughing as they darted into the restricted zone. I felt the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders\u2014one accident, and it would be on me.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the church secretary: someone was waiting for me in the chapel, desperate for guidance. The person was in crisis, she said, and needed spiritual support right away. As a priest, I knew how much it meant to be present in those moments, to offer comfort and counsel when someone\u2019s world was falling apart.\n\nI looked back at the pool, where a group of kids edged closer to the shallow area, and then at the chapel doors in the distance. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands\u2014protecting lives here, or tending to a soul in pain there. The expectations of both roles pulled at me, and I felt torn, unable to ignore either call."}
