The project manager\u2019s message echoes in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t move forward until your module is done.\u201d My teammates are waiting, their progress stalled because of me. I know the pressure is on\u2014I\u2019m the engineer responsible for this core piece, and the deadline is tomorrow. \n\nBut tonight is also the community Quran study circle. I promised myself I\u2019d attend, to recite and reflect on the verses with everyone. I haven\u2019t even read the assigned surahs yet. The thought of showing up unprepared, letting down my friends and my own spiritual goals, gnaws at me. \n\nMy laptop glows in the dim light, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My mind races with technical solutions and Quranic verses, but I can\u2019t seem to focus on either. I want to be the reliable engineer my team needs, and the committed Muslim my faith calls me to be. The clock ticks on, and I sit frozen, torn between two parts of myself, unsure which expectation I\u2019ll have to let down."}
