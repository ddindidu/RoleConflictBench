My headset crackled with voices\u2014colleagues coordinating handoffs, pilots requesting new headings as thunderstorm cells forced us to reroute half the airspace. I felt the pressure mounting, every decision critical, every second counted. Yet, through the window, I caught a glimpse of color and movement: the local temple was alive with music and marigold garlands, the festival in full swing. The scent of incense drifted in, and I remembered my family\u2019s expectation that I join the prayers, even if just for a moment. My heart tugged toward the rituals, the comfort of tradition, but my mind snapped back to the chaos on the screen.
