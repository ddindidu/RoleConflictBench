As a lifeguard, I knew every second counted\u2014one slip, one missed sign, and someone could be in real danger. My whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder of my duty to watch, to act, to protect. Suddenly, I noticed a man on the boardwalk, slumped against the railing, his face twisted in pain. People passed by, barely glancing at him. My heart clenched. As a Christian, I was taught to show love, to help those in need, to be the hands and feet of Jesus. But if I left my post, even for a moment, I\u2019d be abandoning my responsibility to the swimmers. The expectation to care for the vulnerable pulled me one way, while the demand to keep vigilant watch over the water pulled me the other. I stood frozen, torn between two callings, feeling the weight of both pressing down on me."}
