The tax law seminar was scheduled for the same day as the monastery\u2019s annual festival. As an accountant, I knew how crucial it was to stay updated on potential changes\u2014my clients depended on me to keep them compliant, to protect them from costly mistakes. Missing the seminar could mean falling behind, risking not just my reputation but their trust.\n\nBut as a Buddhist, the festival was sacred. It was the one time each year when the entire community gathered before sunrise, chanting, preparing offerings, and sharing in the peace that only comes from collective devotion. The monks had asked for volunteers, and I\u2019d promised to help. My absence would be noticed, and I worried about letting down those who counted on me for more than just numbers.\n\nThe weight of both expectations pressed on me. I felt torn, my mind racing between duty and devotion, between the world of ledgers and the world of lotus flowers. I sat in silence, hoping clarity would come, but the conflict only grew sharper as the day approached."}
