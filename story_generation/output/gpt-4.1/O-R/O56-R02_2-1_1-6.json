Her eyes darted around, searching for reassurance. I knew my job as a hairdresser was to greet her warmly, put her at ease, and help her feel welcome. But as I reached for my apron, my phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series was about to start. As a priest, I was expected to lead that meeting, to guide my parishioners in their spiritual growth and ensure the program was meaningful. I could almost hear the voices of the committee waiting for me, expecting my leadership and vision. My heart pounded as I glanced between the nervous client and my phone. Both needed me\u2014one for comfort and transformation, the other for guidance and inspiration. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides, and for a moment, I stood frozen, torn between two worlds that rarely collided but now demanded my presence at the same time."}
