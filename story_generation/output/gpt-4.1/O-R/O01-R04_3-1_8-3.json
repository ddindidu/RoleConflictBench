As the lead architect, I was responsible for steering my team through a maze of last-minute changes and mounting delays. The client\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford another setback.\u201d My phone buzzed\u2014another site manager needed my input, and the deadline loomed like a storm cloud.\n\nBut it was Friday, and as the imam, the community expected me to stand before them, guiding hearts and minds with the Khutbah. I knew the congregation looked forward to my words, especially during these uncertain times. Yet, today, a guest speaker was ready, his sermon prepared, able to step in if I couldn\u2019t make it.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me.
