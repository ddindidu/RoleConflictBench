The dispatcher\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cThis one\u2019s urgent. Patients are waiting.\u201d My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I navigated the city traffic, heart pounding with the weight of responsibility. But as I stopped at a red light, I realized I hadn\u2019t performed my daily puja. I usually found a quiet moment to repeat my mantra, but today, the rush had swept me along. My mother\u2019s words echoed in my mind, reminding me that even a short prayer keeps me grounded and connected to my faith. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my duty to the patients, the hospital, and my job, clashing with my need to honor my beliefs. The hospital was just a few blocks away. I could pull over for a minute, close my eyes, and whisper the sacred words. But every second counted for the people waiting on my delivery. My breath caught in my throat as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, torn between devotion and duty, unsure which path to choose."}
