As a taxi driver, I prided myself on keeping my car spotless\u2014my passengers expected nothing less. Just as I finished, my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Lee, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her pastor, I knew she needed someone to talk to. I glanced at the clock; my next fare would arrive in five minutes. If I called Mrs. Lee now, I might run late, and my passenger would be greeted by a flustered, distracted driver\u2014not the professional service I promised. But if I waited, Mrs. Lee might feel even more alone. My hands hovered over the steering wheel, torn between the duty to my passengers and the responsibility to my flock, the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
