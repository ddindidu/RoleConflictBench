As a lifeguard, I knew my job was to watch the swimmers without distraction, always alert for the slightest sign of trouble. A few kids drifted toward the deep end, but they seemed fine for now. Still, I couldn\u2019t let my guard down. Then, from the other side of the fence, I saw Mrs. Carter sitting alone on a bench, her shoulders slumped. Word had spread that she\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her pastor, I felt a tug of responsibility. I wanted to go over, offer a gentle word, maybe a prayer\u2014something to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. But my training screamed at me to stay put, eyes on the water, no exceptions. My heart ached as I weighed the silent plea in Mrs. Carter\u2019s eyes against the unspoken trust of every parent at the pool. I gripped the whistle around my neck, torn between two worlds, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
