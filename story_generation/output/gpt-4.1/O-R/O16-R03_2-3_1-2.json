A patient I\u2019d seen that morning presented with a baffling mix of symptoms\u2014fever, joint pain, a strange rash. The tests were inconclusive, and I knew I needed to focus, to dig deeper, to find the answer that could save her life. As a doctor, my duty was clear: I had to diagnose her illness, no matter how elusive it seemed.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again. The mayor\u2019s voice, urgent and pleading, echoed in my mind. The hurricane had devastated our town, and as a nun, I was expected to lead the relief effort, to comfort the homeless, to organize food and shelter. The sisters were already gathering supplies, waiting for my guidance.\n\nI felt torn in two. My heart ached for the suffering outside the hospital walls, but my patient\u2019s life depended on my expertise. Both roles demanded all of me, right now. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of expectation pressing from both sides, unsure which path to take first."}
