The room buzzed with talk of new tax regulations, and I knew how important it was to stay ahead\u2014my clients depended on me to interpret every nuance of the law. Lunch was announced, and I joined the line, scanning the trays for kosher symbols. None. The caterer shrugged apologetically when I asked. I felt the weight of expectation from my colleagues\u2014networking over lunch was part of the job, and skipping the meal would make me stand out. But the thought of eating food that wasn\u2019t kosher made my stomach twist. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice reminding me of our traditions, the care we took at home. My mind raced: should I quietly decline and risk seeming aloof, or compromise my observance for the sake of professional connection? The voices around me faded as I stood, tray in hand, caught between the demands of my profession and the values I hold dear."}
