My hands, rough and calloused, grip the handle of my shovel as I freeze, heart pounding. The foreman\u2019s voice booms, \u201cDrop everything! Muster point, now!\u201d Around me, the crew surges toward the exit, urgency in every stride. I know the protocol\u2014safety first, no exceptions. But as I reach for my hard hat, my watch vibrates. It\u2019s time for morning prayer. The sisters will be gathering in the chapel, their voices rising in gentle unity, fulfilling our sacred routine. I am expected there, kneeling in silent devotion, not here in a neon vest and steel-toed boots. My mind races, torn between the blaring alarm and the quiet call of faith. Both worlds demand my presence, both insist on my loyalty. I stand at the threshold, the weight of my helmet in one hand, my rosary in the other, caught between the clangor of duty and the hush of devotion, unable to move."}
