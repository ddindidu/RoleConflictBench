As a telemarketer, I was still three sales short of my weekly target, and management had made it clear that falling short wasn\u2019t an option. My script was open, my list of leads dwindling, and my fingers hovered over the dial button. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from Ahmed, a gentle soul from the mosque. \u201cImam, if you have a moment today, I\u2019d love to talk.
