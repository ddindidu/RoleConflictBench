I want every detail, right now!\u201d His voice trembled with suspicion, and I could almost see his furrowed brow through the line. As a telemarketer, I was trained to remain calm, answer every objection, and never let a call end unresolved. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t lose a customer, no matter what.\u201d\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. The convent\u2019s monthly food drive was starting in minutes. The sisters would be gathering in the kitchen, sorting cans and preparing meals for the homeless. As a nun, I was expected to be there, hands busy, heart open, serving those in need. Sister Agnes had reminded me just this morning, \u201cYour presence matters, dear. The community counts on you.\u201d\n\nI felt torn, the headset heavy on my head, the habit warm on my shoulders. Mr. Jenkins waited for answers, my sisters waited for me. My mind raced, caught between duty to my job and my calling to serve."}
