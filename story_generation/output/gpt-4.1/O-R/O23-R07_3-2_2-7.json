My client\u2019s anxious voice echoes in my mind\u2014if I don\u2019t catch every nuance tonight, they could face serious financial risk. The clock ticks closer to seven, the time my Buddhist study circle gathers. We\u2019re meant to discuss a new chapter, one I haven\u2019t read yet, and I know my presence is expected. The group relies on me for thoughtful insights, and I crave the peace our discussions bring. Yet, the contract\u2019s urgency claws at me, reminding me of my duty as a lawyer. My mind races between the two worlds: the sharp focus of legal analysis and the gentle openness of spiritual reflection. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing in, my heart torn between the responsibility to protect my client and the longing to nurture my own spiritual growth."}
