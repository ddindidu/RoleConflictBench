My boots are caked with yesterday\u2019s mud, and my hard hat sits heavy on my head. The foreman\u2019s voice crackles over the radio, reminding us that the safety briefing starts in two minutes. I know the expectation: be present, attentive, and ready to work as part of the team. But my heart aches for the quiet I left behind at the convent. Today was supposed to be a rare afternoon of solitude, a time for spiritual reading and silent reflection\u2014an expectation just as sacred, just as binding. I feel the weight of my prayer book in my bag, pressed against the blueprints and gloves. The noise of the site drowns out the silence I crave. My hands tremble, torn between the call to serve my sisters in faith and the duty to my coworkers. The clock ticks down, and I stand at the threshold, caught between the world of steel and the world of spirit, knowing I cannot be in both places at once."}
