My code editor glowed with lines of logic, and I knew I could take my time\u2014there was no rush, the deadline was generous. I could refactor the module later, make it elegant, just as I always strived for. But as I traced a function with my cursor, my thoughts drifted to the note from Mother Superior, still folded neatly beside my keyboard. She had asked me to lead daily reflections for the community during the retreat, a task that demanded deep spiritual study and presence. I felt the weight of her trust, the expectation that I would guide others in faith, not just in code. My mind tugged in two directions: the satisfaction of perfecting my work, and the sacred responsibility of preparing meaningful reflections. Each role called to me, each with its own demands, and I felt the tension coil in my chest. I closed my eyes, caught between the silent logic of the machine and the quiet call of prayer, uncertain which path to follow first."}
