My client\u2019s future depended on my preparation; the stakes were high, and the court would not grant a delay. Yet, as I glanced at my phone, a reminder flashed: the daily prayer service at the chapel, a duty I had never missed. My congregation expected my presence, my guidance, even if today\u2019s service was routine and optional. I could almost hear the quiet shuffle of feet in the pews, the soft murmur of prayers waiting for me to lead. The law demanded my focus, my sharpest mind, but my faith called for my devotion and presence. I felt torn, the expectations of justice and spiritual care pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I weighed the needs of my client against the quiet trust of my parishioners, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
