My checklist for the pre-departure inspection blinked on the console\u2014air conditioning, lights, intercom, all non-critical but still part of my duty to keep the train running smoothly and on time. I glanced at the clock. If I didn\u2019t start now, the train might leave late, and I\u2019d be letting down the hundreds of commuters counting on me.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed in my pocket. A message from Mrs. Kim, a member of my congregation, flashed on the screen. \u201cHeard you\u2019re working today. Sorry to bother, but could use a prayer. Feeling low.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately. As her pastor, I was expected to be there, to offer comfort, even if just a few words to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nMy hand hovered over the checklist, but my mind was with Mrs. Kim. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding punctuality and safety, the other compassion and presence. I felt torn, the expectations of my passengers and my congregation pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which duty to answer first."}
