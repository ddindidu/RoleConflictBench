The hum of the subway tracks still echoed in my ears, but my mind was elsewhere. An email blinked on my phone: a professional development seminar, optional but strongly encouraged. Management expected us to show initiative, to sign up quickly and demonstrate our commitment. I knew I should respond soon, but my attention was pulled to the spread of food laid out for the communal event. Platters of sandwiches and salads, none with kosher certification, and no alternatives in sight. My stomach tightened. I was hungry, but the expectation to observe kosher laws was not something I could easily set aside. My colleagues chatted and filled their plates, glancing at me, perhaps wondering why I hesitated. I felt the weight of two worlds: the professional, urging me to participate fully, to be part of the team; and the personal, rooted in faith, asking me to hold back. My phone buzzed again, a reminder from my supervisor about the seminar. I stared at the food, then at my phone, caught between the demands of my job and the obligations of my faith, unsure which expectation I could meet without betraying the other."}
