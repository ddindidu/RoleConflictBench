I nodded, reaching for my scissors, but my mind was elsewhere. My friends had just messaged me\u2014they were booking their flights for Hajj this year. I\u2019d been saving for months, setting aside every extra tip, dreaming of finally fulfilling this pillar of my faith. But the salon had been slow lately, and I knew that if I refunded Mrs. Lee for her last-minute change, or if she left unhappy, it could mean losing a loyal client and a chunk of my savings. My boss expected me to keep clients satisfied, no matter what. Yet, every riyal counted toward my pilgrimage. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the duty to my client, and the sacred call to Hajj. My hands hovered, scissors poised, as I tried to steady my breath, torn between the expectations of my profession and my faith."}
