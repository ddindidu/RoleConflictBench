My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cEvery corner spotless, every surface sanitized.\u201d I took pride in my work, knowing families depended on me to keep their homes safe. Today, though, as I entered the living room, I overheard the homeowner scolding my friend Priya, another cleaner, for a mess she hadn\u2019t made. Priya\u2019s eyes met mine, pleading silently. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma\u2014for what is right. But my job demanded silence and obedience, no matter what. If I spoke up, I risked my position and the trust placed in me to maintain order and cleanliness. If I stayed quiet, I betrayed my values and my friend. The mop in my hand felt heavier as I stood there, torn between my duty to my work and my duty to my conscience, unsure which voice to follow."}
