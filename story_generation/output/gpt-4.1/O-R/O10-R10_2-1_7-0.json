It was from a client, asking for clarification about a line item on their latest invoice. As an accountant, I knew I needed to respond quickly and clearly, maintaining professionalism and accuracy. But as I started typing my reply, I glanced at the small clock on my monitor. It was almost noon\u2014time for my daily puja. My family always taught me the importance of honoring my faith, even in small ways, and I tried to repeat a short mantra quietly at my desk each day. Today, though, the client\u2019s question nagged at me, and I felt the pressure to answer immediately. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between the expectation to serve my client and the quiet pull of my spiritual practice. The office buzzed around me, and I could feel my heart race as I wrestled with the demands of both roles, unsure which to honor first."}
