The project was behind schedule, and as the lead architect, everyone looked to me to fix it. My boss expected late nights, quick decisions, and constant updates. I felt the weight of the team\u2019s trust and the client\u2019s impatience pressing on my shoulders. \n\nBut as I scrolled through my messages, I saw a reminder from my mother: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Hajj registration opens tomorrow.\u201d My heart tightened. As a Muslim, performing Hajj is a sacred duty, one I\u2019d dreamed of since childhood. Yet, I was early in my career, barely making enough to cover rent, let alone the cost of pilgrimage. My family hoped I would go soon, before life got busier. \n\nI stared at the calendar, torn. If I focused on the project, I\u2019d delay Hajj for years. If I tried to save for Hajj now, I might risk my job and reputation. The expectations from both worlds pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, paralyzed, unsure which path to choose."}
