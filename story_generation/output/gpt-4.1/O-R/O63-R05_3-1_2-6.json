I\u2019ve been with your company for years!\u201d My script as a telemarketer urged me to stay calm, to answer every objection, to keep him on the line. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t let them go until you\u2019ve addressed every concern.\u201d I took a breath, ready to reassure him, when my other phone buzzed\u2014a text from Miriam, the bride-to-be. \u201cRabbi, can you confirm our wedding date for next June? We need to book the hall.\u201d As a rabbi, I knew how much this meant to her, how important it was to offer guidance and certainty, to be present for these milestones. My heart twisted. I couldn\u2019t let Mr. Goldstein feel dismissed, but I also couldn\u2019t leave Miriam waiting, anxious about her future. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting compassion and clarity. I stared at the blinking screens, torn, the seconds stretching as I wrestled with which part of myself to answer first."}
