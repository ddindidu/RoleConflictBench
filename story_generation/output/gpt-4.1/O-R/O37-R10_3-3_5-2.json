My client always expects the floors to shine, and I know she\u2019ll be upset if I don\u2019t use the product she prefers. I check the time\u2014just fifteen minutes until my midday prayer, a ritual I never skip. My faith demands I pause, wash, and chant at the exact hour, offering flowers and incense to the small altar I carry with me. But the nearest store is a ten-minute walk away, and if I leave now, I\u2019ll miss my prayer window. If I wait until after my rituals, I\u2019ll run late on my cleaning schedule, and the client will surely notice. My hands tremble as I weigh the bottle in my palm, feeling the pressure of both worlds\u2014my duty to my work and my devotion to my faith\u2014pulling me in opposite directions."}
