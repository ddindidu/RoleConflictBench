She smiled apologetically, settling into the chair, and I wrapped a towel around her shoulders, preparing for the familiar ritual of washing and conditioning before her trim. My phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced at the screen and my heart dropped: a message from the synagogue president. One of our oldest congregants had passed away unexpectedly, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral as soon as possible. \n\nI looked at Mrs. Goldstein, waiting patiently, trusting me to help her feel renewed. At the same time, I felt the weight of my rabbinic calling\u2014my community needed me to guide them through grief, to offer comfort and tradition in a moment of loss. The expectations pressed in from both sides: the gentle, everyday care of a hairdresser, and the sacred, urgent responsibility of a rabbi. My hands trembled as I reached for the shampoo, torn between two worlds, unsure which to serve first."}
