The deadline isn\u2019t tight, and I know I could take my time, make the code cleaner, more maintainable\u2014just like my team expects. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: it\u2019s almost time for the weekly study session with my kids. Teaching them about our Jewish traditions, sharing stories and values, is something I promised myself I\u2019d never compromise on. I could shift the lesson to another day\u2014there\u2019s flexibility, and the kids wouldn\u2019t miss a beat. But then, am I showing them that our heritage is something to be moved around for convenience? On the other hand, if I leave the code as it is, I\u2019ll be letting my team down, knowing I could have done better. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my best, each unwilling to be second. I sit, torn, the cursor blinking, the lesson plan open, caught between the expectations of my work and my faith."}
