As the lead architect, my phone buzzed constantly\u2014site managers reporting delays, engineers needing decisions, clients demanding updates. The project was behind schedule, and the deadline was immovable. My team looked to me for guidance, expecting swift solutions and unwavering focus. Yet, my mind wandered to the church, where tonight I was expected to lead the most significant religious service of the year. The congregation would gather, waiting for me to guide them in prayer, to offer comfort and tradition. My absence would be noticed, my presence expected. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest\u2014one demanding my leadership to keep a project from collapse, the other needing my spiritual guidance to uphold a cherished ritual. I stared at my phone, torn between two calls, each representing a part of who I am, and felt the tension coil tighter within me."}
