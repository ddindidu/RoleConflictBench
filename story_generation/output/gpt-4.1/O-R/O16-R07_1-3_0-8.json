My patient, Mrs. Lin, sat across from me, sniffling and coughing. Her symptoms pointed to a common cold, but she looked anxious, asking if it could be something more serious. As a doctor, I knew I needed to be thorough\u2014review her history, order tests if necessary, and reassure her with careful explanations. Yet, my mind kept drifting to the Buddhist texts on my desk. My teacher had asked me to summarize key teachings for tomorrow\u2019s temple session, a rare honor and responsibility. I felt the weight of expectation from both sides: my patients needed my full attention and expertise, while my spiritual community expected thoughtful reflection and preparation. I glanced at the clock again, feeling the pressure mount. Could I give Mrs. Lin the care she deserved and still find time for the deep study and contemplation my teacher expected? My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my presence, each expectation pulling me further from the other."}
