My shift as a police officer had ended, and I finally had a window to hit the gym. Physical fitness isn\u2019t just a personal goal\u2014it\u2019s a duty. I need to be strong, alert, ready to protect the people who count on me. As I grabbed my bag, my phone buzzed. A message from the mosque committee: \u201cOur regular imam is away. Can you lead the Maghrib prayer tonight? The congregation is expecting you.\u201d\n\nI stared at the message, heart pounding. As an imam, I know how much the community relies on me for guidance and spiritual leadership, especially when the regular imam is absent. They expect me to be present, to lead them in prayer, to offer comfort and wisdom. But I also know that if I skip my workout, I\u2019m neglecting my responsibility as a police officer. My mind raced, torn between the call to serve my community\u2019s faith and my duty to maintain the strength needed to protect them. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, and I stood frozen, keys in hand, caught between two worlds that both needed me\u2014right now."}
