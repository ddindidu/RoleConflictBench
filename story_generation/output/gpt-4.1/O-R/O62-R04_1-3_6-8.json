As a lifeguard, I was responsible for every person in that pool, and I\u2019d already noticed a few children slipping into the shallow end without an adult nearby. I was about to step in and enforce the rules when my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. It was a message from the mosque: a community member had just arrived, overwhelmed with grief after a sudden loss, and was asking for me by name. As the imam, I knew how much people depended on me for comfort and guidance, especially in moments like this. My heart pounded as I looked from the pool to the exit, torn between my duty to keep these swimmers safe and my calling to offer solace to someone in pain. Both roles demanded my immediate presence, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing down on me, forcing me to choose which responsibility to honor first."}
