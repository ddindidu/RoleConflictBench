The carpenter caught my eye, tapping his foot impatiently, waiting for the next load so he could keep working. I knew if I slowed down, the whole crew would fall behind, and the foreman would have words for me. Just as I reached the stack, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Brother Yusuf, a long-time congregant. He wrote, \u201cImam, I really need to talk. My family situation is getting worse. Can you meet soon?\u201d I could almost hear the desperation in his words. My heart twisted\u2014he trusted me for guidance, and I knew how much he was struggling.
