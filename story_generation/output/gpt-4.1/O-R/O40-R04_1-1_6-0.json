She held out a small, splintered wooden train, her son clinging to her side. \u201cCan you fix it?\u201d she asked, hope flickering in her voice. I examined the toy, already calculating the time and materials needed. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the afternoon prayer was in twenty minutes. As the imam, I was expected to lead, even though today the congregation would be small and Brother Yusuf, fully qualified, was already at the mosque. My heart tugged in two directions: the mother\u2019s expectation that I would restore her child\u2019s beloved toy, and my community\u2019s trust in me to guide their prayer. I could picture the little boy\u2019s disappointment if I turned them away, but I also felt the weight of my responsibility as imam, knowing some would be comforted by my presence. The clock ticked, and I stood in my workshop, torn between the gentle demands of my craft and the sacred call of my faith, unsure which path to take."}
