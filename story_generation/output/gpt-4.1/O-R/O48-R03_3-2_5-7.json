His breathing was shallow, and the monitor beeped a warning. As a nursing assistant, I knew I had to stay close, checking his vitals every few minutes. The nurse had made it clear: his condition could change in an instant. Yet, my phone vibrated in my pocket\u2014a message from Sister Agnes. A parishioner, Maria, was waiting in the chapel, desperate to talk about her crisis of faith. As a nun, I was expected to offer guidance, to listen and pray with those in need. I could picture Maria\u2019s anxious face, her hope that I might help her find peace. But Mr. Lee\u2019s life could depend on my vigilance. My mind raced, torn between the urgent physical needs of my patient and the spiritual needs of my parishioner. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders, the stethoscope and the rosary, each demanding my presence. I stood in the hallway, paralyzed, caught between the beeping monitor and the silent call of the chapel."}
