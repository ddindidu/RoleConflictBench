The sales manager\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sign-ups, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d My screen flashes with the next number, but my thoughts are stuck on what I overheard in the break room\u2014Raj, my colleague, bragging about faking customer consent to boost his numbers. I know this is wrong, deeply wrong, not just by company policy but by my own beliefs. As a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to act with honesty and compassion, to avoid causing harm. Yet, the pressure to meet targets is suffocating. If I report Raj, the team might miss the target, and everyone will suffer. If I stay silent, I betray my values and let injustice slide. My hands tremble as I hover over the phone, torn between the demands of my job and the voice of dharma whispering in my heart."}
