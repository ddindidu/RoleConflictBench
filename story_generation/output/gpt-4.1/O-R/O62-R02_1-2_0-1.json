As a lifeguard, I was expected to watch every swimmer, never letting my attention waver. A few kids drifted toward the deep end, but they seemed fine for now. Still, I couldn\u2019t relax. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the main weekly service was about to begin. As the community\u2019s priest, I was supposed to lead the prayers, offer guidance, and be present for everyone. I pictured the congregation gathering, waiting for me to start. My heart pounded. If I left my post, even for a short while, I\u2019d be failing my duty to protect these swimmers. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my community, who counted on me for spiritual support. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt torn, unable to reconcile the demands of saving lives and saving souls."}
