I glanced at the screen: a customer, anxious about their package, wanted an update. As a delivery person, I knew I was expected to respond quickly and professionally, to reassure them and keep the company\u2019s reputation intact. But tonight was different. I was scheduled to chant a Torah portion at the service\u2014a responsibility I\u2019d accepted weeks ago, one that meant a lot to my community and to me as a Jew. The clock ticked closer to the start of the service. My tallit was already draped over my arm, but my work phone kept vibrating, the customer\u2019s messages growing more insistent. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between my duty to my job and my commitment to my faith. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, phone in one hand, prayer book in the other, wrestling with which expectation I would have to let down."}
