Suddenly, a pilot\u2019s voice cut through, tense and urgent: \u201cTower, this is Delta 417, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors to the nearest runway.\u201d My training kicked in, heart pounding as I prepared to reroute traffic and clear a path. Every second mattered; lives depended on my calm precision.\n\nYet, in the back of my mind, another voice whispered. Tonight was the weekly Buddhist study circle, the one time each week I could set aside the world\u2019s noise and turn inward, reflecting on the teachings I so rarely had time to absorb. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss it again, especially since we were finally discussing the chapter I\u2019d struggled with for months.\n\nDuty to the pilots, to the lives in the sky, pressed against my chest. But the longing for stillness, for spiritual growth, tugged at me just as fiercely. I stared at the radar, torn between the urgent demands of the airspace and the quiet sanctuary waiting for me, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
