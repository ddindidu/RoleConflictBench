My foreman\u2019s voice crackled over the radio, \u201cSafety briefing in two minutes\u2014everyone to the trailer.\u201d I knew the rules: miss the briefing, and you\u2019re off the site for the day. My crew depended on me to pull my weight, to keep the project moving. But as I reached for my hard hat, my phone buzzed with a message from the convent. The mayor was pleading for help\u2014hundreds displaced by the hurricane, families desperate for food and shelter. As a nun, I was expected to lead the relief effort, to be a beacon of compassion and action. My heart pounded. The construction site demanded my presence, my team counting on me for safety and solidarity. Yet, the faces of the homeless haunted me, the call to serve echoing louder than the machinery.
