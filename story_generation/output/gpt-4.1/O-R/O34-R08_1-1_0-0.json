My screens show only a handful of blips, each aircraft gliding smoothly through empty airspace. It\u2019s one of those rare shifts where the radio is mostly silent, and the holding patterns are empty. I know my job: stay vigilant, manage the airspace, be ready for anything. But tonight, the calm is almost lulling, and my mind drifts to the Quran resting in my bag. As a Muslim, I cherish these peaceful moments to recite and reflect, especially before dawn. The expectation is clear\u2014use this time for spiritual growth, deepen my connection with Allah. Yet, the other expectation presses in: remain alert, eyes on the radar, mind sharp for any sudden change. I feel the tug between my roles\u2014one calling me to spiritual devotion, the other demanding unwavering attention. My heart aches with the desire to open the Quran, but my training warns me against even a moment\u2019s distraction. The minutes tick by, and I sit, torn, wrestling with the weight of both responsibilities."}
