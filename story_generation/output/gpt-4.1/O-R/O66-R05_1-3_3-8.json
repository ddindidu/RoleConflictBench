One of my congregants had just passed away, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral as soon as possible. My heart clenched; I knew how much comfort my presence could bring them in this moment of grief. But as I glanced at the speedometer, I remembered my duty as a taxi driver: to follow every traffic law, to drive safely and defensively, no matter what. The roads were open, the traffic light, and the temptation to press harder on the gas pedal gnawed at me. I could hear the family\u2019s voices in my mind, pleading for me to hurry, to be there for them. Yet, I also felt the weight of responsibility to my passenger, to the law, to every other driver on the road. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I wrestled with the impossible choice between compassion and caution, between my calling as a rabbi and my duty as a driver."}
