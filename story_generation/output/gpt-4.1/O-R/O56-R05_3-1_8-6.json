She winced as I tried to ease out a tangle, and I apologized, knowing I\u2019d need extra time to condition and detangle before I could even think about cutting. The salon was busy, and I was already running behind. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a text from a young couple, asking if I could officiate their wedding next spring. They wanted to meet soon, to talk about dates and details. I knew how important it was to make them feel heard and supported, to help them start their new life together with blessing and care. But right now, Mrs. Goldstein needed my full attention, and the other stylists were glancing over, waiting for me to free up the sink. My mind raced, torn between the immediate needs of my client and the long-term commitment of my congregation. I could feel the pressure mounting, the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
