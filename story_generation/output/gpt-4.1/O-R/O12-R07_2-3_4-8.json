Slack messages from the product team pile up, each one a reminder that they\u2019re waiting for my technical input. The deadline is tomorrow, and I know the whole project hinges on these decisions. My mind races with architecture diagrams and edge cases, but my phone buzzes with a gentle reminder: my teacher\u2019s invitation to summarize key Buddhist teachings for tomorrow\u2019s temple session. I promised to reflect deeply, to bring clarity and sincerity to the sangha. The expectation is not just to show up, but to be present, to offer something meaningful. I feel the tension in my chest\u2014one part of me pulled by the urgent demands of my team, the other by the quiet call to spiritual study. I want to be reliable, to not let anyone down, but the hours are slipping away. My heart aches as I wrestle with these incompatible expectations, unsure which path to follow as the night deepens."}
