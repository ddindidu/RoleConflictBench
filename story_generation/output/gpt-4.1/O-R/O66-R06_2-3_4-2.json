As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: drive defensively, obey every traffic law, especially in weather like this. Cars darted in and out of lanes, brake lights flaring unpredictably. My hands tightened on the wheel, every sense alert. Then, a passenger in the backseat\u2014her voice trembling\u2014begged me to hurry. She said her child was in the hospital, and every second counted. My heart twisted. As a Christian, I felt the weight of compassion, the call to help those in need, to show mercy and love. But the rain, the traffic, the law\u2014they pressed in on me. If I sped, I could endanger lives, break the law, betray my duty as a driver. If I didn\u2019t, was I failing her, failing my faith? The tension knotted in my chest, my mind racing between the rules of the road and the call of my conscience, caught between two worlds, unsure which voice to follow."}
