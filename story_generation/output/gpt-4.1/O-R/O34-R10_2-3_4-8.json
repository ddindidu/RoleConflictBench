Pilots\u2019 voices crackled through the static, each one waiting for my instructions as the cloud tops rose dangerously fast. My mind raced, calculating safe altitudes, issuing updates, and keeping everyone calm. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from my family. Today was the festival I\u2019d traveled so far to attend, a sacred day I\u2019d promised to honor with full devotion. My relatives were already gathering, preparing offerings, waiting for me to join the rituals that connected us to our ancestors and gods. I felt the weight of their expectations, the importance of my presence, the spiritual fulfillment I\u2019d longed for. Yet, here I was, responsible for dozens of lives in the sky, unable to leave my post. The demands of duty and faith pulled at me, each urgent, each impossible to ignore. My heart pounded as I stared at the screens, torn between the voices in my headset and the prayers echoing in my memory, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
