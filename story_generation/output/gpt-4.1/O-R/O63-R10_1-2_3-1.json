The sales board glows with my name near the top\u2014my calls have been smooth, and I\u2019m already on track to beat my quota. My manager\u2019s praise still rings in my mind, and I know if I keep this up, I might finally get that bonus. But as the clock ticks closer to dusk, a familiar tug pulls at me. I glance at the small brass lamp and the marigold garland on my home altar. Every evening, I\u2019m expected to pause, light the lamp, and offer prayers\u2014my way of honoring my faith and grounding myself. Yet, the phone keeps ringing, and every minute away from my desk could mean a lost sale.
