As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce every safety rule, and lately, swimmers had been slipping into the shallow end without supervision. My supervisor had warned me: no exceptions, no distractions. But today was different. My family was waiting for me at home, the house already filled with the scent of incense and marigolds for the puja. As a Hindu, it was my duty to be present, to honor the gods and my ancestors, dressed in clean, traditional clothes, not the chlorine-scented uniform I wore now.\n\nMy shift was supposed to end soon, but the pool was still busy, and the supervisor hinted I might need to stay late. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I left early, I\u2019d be letting down my team and risking someone\u2019s safety. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the ceremony, disappointing my family and failing in my religious duty. My heart pounded as I watched another group of kids inch toward the shallow end, my mind torn between the whistle in my hand and the prayer beads waiting at home."}
