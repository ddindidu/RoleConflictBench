As a telemarketer, I was expected to close three more deals before the end of my shift, or risk a stern talk from my manager. My headset felt heavier than usual as I dialed number after number, rehearsing my pitch, trying to sound upbeat despite the anxiety gnawing at me. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was in the church office, waiting for me, her text trembling with urgency\u2014she needed guidance about a life-altering decision. As her pastor, I was supposed to offer her my full attention, compassion, and wisdom. But the sales clock was ticking, and every minute spent away from my desk meant another missed opportunity. My mind spun, torn between the demands of my job and my calling, the pressure to perform and the need to be present for someone in pain. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, paralyzed by the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
