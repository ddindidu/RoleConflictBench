The wind outside howled, rattling the stained-glass windows, and I could see the dust swirling in the corners, settling on the polished floors I\u2019d worked so hard to keep spotless. As the housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to maintain the house\u2019s cleanliness, especially now, when the rain and wind brought in more mess than ever. My supervisor had already reminded me twice this week that standards must not slip, no matter the weather.\n\nBut my habit felt heavy on my shoulders, a reminder of my other calling. As a nun, I was expected to serve the community, and now, after the hurricane, the mayor himself had come to our door, pleading for help. Hundreds were homeless, desperate for food, shelter, and comfort. My sisters were already gathering supplies, and I could hear their voices echoing down the hall, calling for me to join them.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pounding with anxiety. The mop trembled in my grip as I looked from the dirty floor to the open door, where the world outside waited for me to choose."}
