My patient, Mrs. Sharma, sat across from me, her eyes searching mine for reassurance as she asked about her blood pressure and diet. I listened, nodding, trying to offer comfort and clarity, but my mind kept drifting to home. It was almost sunset\u2014the sacred hour for my daily puja. I could picture the small brass lamp on my altar, waiting to be lit, the incense ready to curl upward in fragrant spirals. My family expected me to lead the prayers, to keep our tradition alive. Yet here I was, a doctor, expected to be fully present, to answer every question with patience and care. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the gentle urgency of my faith and the immediate needs of my patient. My heart pounded as I tried to focus, torn between the call of my profession and the quiet pull of my beliefs, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
