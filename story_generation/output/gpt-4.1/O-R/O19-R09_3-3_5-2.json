The patient in front of me is elderly, her list of medications long and complicated. I know how crucial it is to explain every interaction, every side effect\u2014her safety depends on my thoroughness. But my phone vibrates again: a reminder that my son\u2019s bar mitzvah is just days away, and he\u2019s still struggling with his Torah portion. I promised to help him tonight, to sit with him and guide him through the words, to pass on the traditions that mean so much to our family. My mind races with the weight of both responsibilities. My patient expects my undivided attention, my expertise as a pharmacist. My son expects my presence, my guidance as a Jewish parent. I feel torn, the demands of my profession and my faith pulling me in opposite directions. I want to be everything for both of them, but right now, I don\u2019t know how."}
