The foreman\u2019s voice echoed in my ears, \u201cHurry up, the carpenter\u2019s waiting!\u201d I could see the carpenter tapping his foot, glancing at his watch, anxious to keep the project moving. My muscles ached, but I pushed myself harder, knowing that any delay would slow everyone down. Yet, as I walked, I felt the familiar tug inside me\u2014a reminder that I hadn\u2019t performed my morning puja, only whispered a hurried mantra under my breath before leaving for work. My mother\u2019s words echoed in my mind, \u201cNever neglect your prayers, even on the busiest days.\u201d The guilt gnawed at me. I wanted to stop, just for a moment, to close my eyes and recite the full prayer, to feel the peace it always brought me. But the demands of the site pressed in, the expectation to keep moving, to not let anyone down. My heart pounded with the struggle, torn between the world of bricks and beams and the quiet call of my faith."}
