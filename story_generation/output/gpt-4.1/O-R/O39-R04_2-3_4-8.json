Suddenly, I spotted a small puddle of oil near the main path\u2014dangerous, especially with the crew due back from lunch any minute. I grabbed a rag, ready to clean it up, when my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque: a brother had just arrived, shaken and grieving, asking for me. He needed comfort, guidance\u2014right now. My heart twisted. As a laborer, I knew I couldn\u2019t leave the spill; someone could get hurt, and I was responsible for their safety. But as an imam, I felt the weight of the man\u2019s pain, the expectation that I would be there for him in his darkest hour. I stood frozen, rag in hand, torn between the urgent needs of two worlds, each demanding my presence, each too important to ignore."}
