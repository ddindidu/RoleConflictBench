The hospital project was behind schedule, and the contractor was pressuring me to sign off on the latest inspection. But I\u2019d found a flaw in the fire escape plan\u2014one that could put lives at risk. My phone buzzed. It was Sarah, a member of my congregation. Her voice trembled as she asked if I could meet; she was facing a crisis, desperate for guidance. I glanced at the clock. The city inspector would be here in an hour, and I needed to finalize my report. But Sarah\u2019s pain was real, and as her pastor, I felt responsible for her well-being. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the architect, bound by duty to protect future patients; the pastor, called to offer comfort and wisdom. I felt torn, my heart racing as I tried to decide which responsibility to answer first, knowing that either choice meant letting someone down."}
