As a housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to follow every safety and hygiene protocol, especially today, when a stomach flu outbreak had swept through the building. The supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts. Protective equipment at all times.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014just an hour until the most significant religious holiday of the year. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, to be present for every soul who would gather, seeking comfort and guidance. My phone buzzed with messages from parishioners: \u201cWe need you tonight, Father.\u201d I could picture the crowded sanctuary, the candles, the hopeful faces. But here, in the harsh fluorescent light, I saw the mop, the disinfectant, the duty to protect others from illness. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles, each demanding my full presence, each vital in its own way. I stared at my reflection, torn between the sacred and the sanitary, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
