The phone queue was relentless, and management had sent another reminder: \u201cBreaks must be logged exactly as scheduled. No exceptions.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014my break was in five minutes, but the queue was longer than ever. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind, \u201cWe need you on the phones. Every minute counts.\u201d\n\nBut my other life tugged at me. My Bible sat open beside my keyboard, pages marked for the sermon I needed to finish. Sunday was approaching, and I hadn\u2019t yet found the right words to guide my congregation through a difficult moral dilemma. They expected wisdom, clarity, and a calm spirit\u2014qualities I struggled to summon after hours of scripted sales pitches and relentless targets.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I took my break to work on the sermon, I\u2019d risk management\u2019s disapproval. If I stayed on the phones, I\u2019d let down my congregation. My heart pounded as I watched the seconds tick by, torn between the demands of my job and my calling, unsure which expectation I could afford to disappoint."}
