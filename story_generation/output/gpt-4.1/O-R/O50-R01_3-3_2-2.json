The nurse\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cThe life-support machine is failing. We need you now.\u201d As a machine repairer, I knew every second mattered\u2014someone\u2019s life hung in the balance, and my hands were expected to bring the device back from the brink.

As her pastor, I was her anchor, the one she trusted to guide her through the storm.
