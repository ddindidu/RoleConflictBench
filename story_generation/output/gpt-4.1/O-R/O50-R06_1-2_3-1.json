As the lead machine repairer, everyone counted on me to ensure the machines were cleaned and serviced perfectly\u2014any mistake could mean costly downtime. My supervisor had emphasized how critical this maintenance was, and I felt the weight of that responsibility pressing on my shoulders.\n\nBut as I walked past the break room, I overheard two coworkers talking about a shortcut\u2014using a cleaning solvent that wasn\u2019t approved, but would save hours of work. They planned to do it during the shutdown, and one of them winked at me, assuming I\u2019d go along. The shortcut was against company policy and could be dangerous, but it was tempting; it would make my job easier and please my boss.\n\nYet, as a Christian, I knew I was called to honesty and integrity, to do what was right even when no one was watching. The thought of compromising my values gnawed at me. I felt torn between the expectations of my job and the demands of my faith, my mind swirling with anxiety as I realized I had to choose which role to honor."}
