Pre-dawn traffic is light\u2014no holding patterns, no urgent reroutes. My headset hums with the quiet voices of pilots, all routine. Yet my mind drifts to the synagogue, where in just an hour, Miriam will arrive for her final study session before her Beit Din. She\u2019s nervous, and I promised to guide her through the last passages, to answer her questions, to be present as her rabbi. But the schedule changed last night\u2014an unexpected cargo flight is now set to land, and I\u2019m the only controller on shift. The expectation is clear: I must keep the airspace safe, alert, and ready for anything. But as a rabbi, I am also expected to be a steady presence, a teacher, especially for someone standing at the threshold of a new life. My heart pounds as I watch the empty sky, feeling the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders, knowing soon I\u2019ll have to choose which promise to keep."}
