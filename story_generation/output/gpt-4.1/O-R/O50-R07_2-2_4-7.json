They\u2019d missed their last service window, and now a few were running hotter than I\u2019d ever seen. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime. Stay late if you have to.\u201d I wiped my hands on my overalls, feeling the grit of oil and worry. But tonight was also the weekly study circle at the temple, the one time each week I could sit with others and reflect on the teachings, let the noise of the world fall away. We were supposed to discuss a new chapter, one I hadn\u2019t even read yet. The thought of missing it made my chest tighten; I needed that peace, that sense of connection. Yet, the machines demanded my attention, their needs as urgent as any prayer. I stood in the middle of the workshop, torn between the clamor of metal and the quiet call of the Dharma, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in."}
