As a doctor, I was expected to act quickly, to diagnose his mysterious illness and save his life. My mind raced through possible causes, ordering tests, barking instructions, feeling the weight of his life in my hands. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart clenched. It was nearly time for my weekly study session with the children at the synagogue\u2014a time I cherished, teaching them about our Jewish traditions, values, and history. They looked forward to these lessons, and I felt a deep responsibility to nurture their connection to our heritage. The hospital could call in another physician, but I knew my expertise might make the difference for this patient. Yet, if I left, I\u2019d be letting down the children and my community. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the urgent needs of my patient and the quiet, enduring needs of my faith and my students."}
