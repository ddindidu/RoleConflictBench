As an accountant, I knew the urgency\u2014any delay in responding to a discrepancy could mean penalties for my client, or worse, an audit. My mind raced through the regulations, the files I\u2019d need to review, the precise language I\u2019d have to use in my reply. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the workshop for our community leaders was about to begin. As their pastor, I was expected to guide them through challenging theological concepts, to answer their questions with patience and wisdom, to be fully present. Both roles demanded my undivided attention, both were urgent in their own way. I felt the weight of expectation pressing from both sides\u2014compliance and integrity on one, spiritual leadership and care on the other. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the call of duty and the call of faith, knowing I could not give my best to both at the same time."}
