As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce every safety rule, no exceptions. Today, the deep end was off-limits, but I spotted a small child floundering past the rope, panic in his eyes. My heart pounded\u2014I knew I had to act fast. But as I reached for the rescue tube, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the monthly food drive at the convent was starting now. As a nun, I was counted on to serve the community, to be present and help those in need. The sisters would be waiting, the shelter depending on our help. I felt torn, the weight of both uniforms pressing on me. The pool echoed with shouts, the convent bell chimed in my mind. I stood frozen, caught between the urgent call of the water and the quiet duty of charity, unsure which vow to answer first."}
