As a subway operator, I was expected to perform the pre-departure check, making sure every non-critical system was in order before the first train rolled out. The city depended on us to be on time, and any delay would ripple through the day. But my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder: it was time for my daily puja. As a Hindu, I was raised to light a lamp and offer prayers at my home altar every morning, a ritual that brought me peace and connection. My family expected me to keep this tradition alive, and I felt the weight of their hopes. Standing in the operator\u2019s cabin, I stared at the checklist in my hand, my mind torn between the duty to my passengers and the devotion to my faith. The seconds ticked by, each one tightening the knot in my chest as I wrestled with which expectation to honor."}
