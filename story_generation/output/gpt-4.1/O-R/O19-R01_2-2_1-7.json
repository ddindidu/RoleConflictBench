She depended on me to get her medications right\u2014her heart, her diabetes, her pain. One mistake could mean a hospital visit, or worse. My mind kept drifting, though, to the sermon I needed to finish for Sunday. The congregation expected guidance, clarity, and hope, especially now, when so many were struggling with tough choices. I felt the weight of their trust, just as I felt Mrs. Carter\u2019s. The phone rang with another refill request, and my email pinged with a reminder from the church council. My hands shook as I measured out the pills, my thoughts tangled between drug interactions and biblical passages. I knew I couldn\u2019t let either side down, but the demands pressed in from both directions, each urgent, each sacred. I stared at the prescription label, my heart pounding, torn between the science in my hands and the faith in my heart, unsure which voice to answer first."}
