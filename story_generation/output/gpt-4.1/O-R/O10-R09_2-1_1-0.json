The month-end deadline looms, and my manager\u2019s reminder echoes in my mind: \u201cWe need the books closed by tomorrow morning, no exceptions.\u201d I know every figure must be perfect\u2014no room for error. My phone buzzes with a message from my daughter: \u201cAre we still doing our Torah study tonight?\u201d I promised her we\u2019d talk about the story of Ruth, something I\u2019ve looked forward to all week. Teaching her about our traditions, our history, is a responsibility I cherish. But the numbers won\u2019t wait, and neither will my daughter\u2019s bedtime. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to my job, my commitment to my family and faith. I want to be the reliable accountant my team depends on, and the parent who passes on our Jewish heritage. My hands hover over the keyboard, torn between the spreadsheet and the storybook, heart pounding as I wrestle with which role to honor tonight."}
