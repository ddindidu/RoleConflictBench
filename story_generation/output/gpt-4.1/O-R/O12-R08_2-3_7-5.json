The app was crashing, and the team chat was buzzing with urgency. As the lead developer, everyone expected me to jump in, troubleshoot, and fix the bugs immediately. But I was standing at the entrance of the mosque, about to enter the main prayer hall for Friday prayers. I glanced down at my clothes\u2014my work shirt was fine, but I\u2019d forgotten to bring my long-sleeved overshirt, and my sleeves were rolled up past my elbows. I knew I should dress more modestly, especially for Jumu\u2019ah, but the rush at work had made me forget. Now, I felt the weight of two worlds pressing on me: the responsibility to my users and team, and the duty to my faith and community. My phone vibrated again, and I could hear the imam\u2019s voice starting the khutbah. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the expectations of my faith, unsure which role to answer first."}
