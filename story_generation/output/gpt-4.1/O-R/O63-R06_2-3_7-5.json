The phone queue was still full, and I could feel the eyes of management on us, tracking every second we spent away from our desks. My headset felt heavy, and my voice was already hoarse from the morning\u2019s calls. I knew I was supposed to take my break now, but the pressure to keep answering calls was intense\u2014if I left, the queue would only get longer, and I\u2019d risk a reprimand.\n\nBut today was Sunday, and my church service would start in fifteen minutes. As a Christian, I was expected to be there, to worship and join the community. Missing a service wasn\u2019t just about skipping a ritual; it meant letting down my church family and, in a way, my faith. I could already imagine the gentle disappointment in my pastor\u2019s eyes, the absence I\u2019d feel in my own heart.\n\nI sat frozen, torn between the demands of my job and the pull of my faith, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me, unsure which path to choose."}
