I\u2019d promised Pastor Lee I\u2019d help set up chairs today, and I could already imagine the disappointed looks if I didn\u2019t show. But as I turned onto Maple Avenue, the road narrowed sharply, orange cones forcing all traffic into a single lane. Up ahead, the blinking yellow lights of the school zone flashed, and a group of children clustered near the curb, waiting for the crossing guard. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cChurch service, 9:00 AM.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to slow down, obey the speed limit, and watch for any sudden movement from the kids. But the minutes ticked by, and I pictured the church filling up without me, my absence noticed. My hands tightened on the wheel. I wanted to be a responsible driver, but I also wanted to be a faithful member of my church community. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself caught between the demands of the road and the call of my faith, unsure which to answer first."}
