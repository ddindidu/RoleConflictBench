As a police officer, I was expected to enforce the law, to quiet the disturbance and restore peace to the neighborhood. I took a deep breath, preparing myself to confront the revelers inside. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was waiting at the church, desperate for guidance about a decision that could change her life. As her pastor, I was supposed to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and wisdom. I stared at the flashing lights reflected in the windshield, feeling the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me. The law demanded my presence here, but my calling as a pastor pulled me in the opposite direction. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, torn between duty and compassion, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
