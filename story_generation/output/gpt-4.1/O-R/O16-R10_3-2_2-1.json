The patient before me was gasping for breath, his symptoms baffling and severe. As a doctor, I was expected to remain calm, to diagnose quickly and accurately, to save lives. Every second counted. Yet, in the back of my mind, I remembered the time\u2014this was the sacred hour I always set aside to light a lamp and offer prayers at my home altar. As a Hindu, this daily ritual was not just a habit but a promise to my faith and family, a moment of peace and connection with the divine. Now, the demands of my profession and my devotion clashed inside me. My hands trembled as I reached for the patient\u2019s chart, my heart torn between the urgent cries of the emergency room and the silent call of my spiritual duty. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down, each expecting my undivided attention, each unwilling to wait."}
