Cars darted in and out of lanes, their impatience making every intersection a test of nerves. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to stay alert, follow every traffic law, and anticipate the next reckless move. My mind, however, kept drifting to the quiet convent library, where I had planned to spend the afternoon in spiritual reading and reflection. The sacred texts waited for me, promising peace and renewal, but here I was, tense and alert, far from the calm I craved. I felt the weight of my habit beneath my jacket, a constant reminder of my calling. The world outside demanded vigilance and quick reflexes, while my soul yearned for stillness and prayer. Each red light was a moment to wrestle with the guilt of postponing my spiritual duties, even as I knew my passengers depended on my focus and care. The rain blurred the city lights, and I wondered how I could possibly honor both roads I was meant to travel."}
