The client\u2019s antique table, centerpiece of their living room, needed that specific cleaner\u2014nothing else would do. I was expected to keep supplies stocked, to anticipate needs, to never let the household run out. But I\u2019d been so preoccupied lately, my mind split between this job and my other calling. Today was the most important religious holiday of the year, and as the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, to be present for everyone, to guide them through the rituals that meant so much. The service would start in less than an hour, and people would already be gathering, waiting for me. Yet here I was, in my cleaning uniform, holding an empty bottle, knowing the client would be upset if the table wasn\u2019t perfect. My phone buzzed with a reminder for the service. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
