The roads were clear, the sun just beginning to dip, and I had a few more fares before my shift ended. But my mind wasn\u2019t on the next passenger. It was on the holiday approaching in two days, and the realization that my children still hadn\u2019t learned the blessings they needed to recite. My wife had reminded me that morning, her voice gentle but firm: \u201cThey need you to teach them. It\u2019s important.\u201d \n\nBut here I was, behind the wheel, responsible for getting people safely to their destinations, following every traffic law, driving carefully. I couldn\u2019t just rush home, not with passengers depending on me and my license on the line. Yet, the guilt gnawed at me. Was I failing as a father, as a Jew, if I let another evening slip by without teaching my children? The light turned green. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the duty to my job and the duty to my family and faith, feeling the weight of both pressing in on me."}
