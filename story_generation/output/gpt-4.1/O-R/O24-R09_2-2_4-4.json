The law is clear, but the facts are tangled, and I know the parties are waiting anxiously for my judgment. The court expects clarity, precision, and timeliness\u2014thirty days to deliver a detailed opinion that will shape lives. My stomach growls, reminding me I haven\u2019t eaten since morning. I glance at the clock; it\u2019s late, and the only kosher vendor nearby will close soon. As a Jew, I am expected to keep kosher, a commitment I have never taken lightly, even when traveling. But the hours I spend searching for food are hours I could spend writing, reviewing, ensuring my judgment is just and thorough. The weight of both roles presses on me: the law\u2019s demand for diligence, my faith\u2019s call for discipline. I stare at the blinking cursor, torn between the hunger in my body and the hunger for integrity in my work and beliefs, feeling the tension rise as the minutes slip away."}
