My manager hovered nearby, waiting for my effort estimates so the client contract could be finalized. The pressure was intense\u2014everyone was counting on me to be precise, to keep the project on track. At the same time, I glanced at the invitation for the office function scheduled for this afternoon. It was a big event, with colleagues from every department, men and women mingling freely. The unspoken expectation was to dress up, to blend in with the team, maybe even let loose a little. But as a Muslim, I felt the weight of my own values\u2014modesty in dress, a quiet dignity in how I presented myself. I could already imagine the curious glances if I showed up in my usual modest attire, the subtle questions, the feeling of being different. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the quiet, persistent call of my faith. The clock ticked on, and I felt the tension building inside me, unsure which expectation I could afford to disappoint."}
