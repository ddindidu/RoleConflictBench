I started drafting the response, my mind already shifting to the next set of reconciliations. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was Miriam, her voice trembling. Her father had passed away, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral as soon as possible. I could hear the grief in her words, the urgency in her request. As their rabbi, I knew how much my presence and guidance would mean to them in this moment of loss. But as the accountant, I was already behind on correspondence, and the vendor\u2019s reply couldn\u2019t wait without risking our professional relationship. My inbox pinged again, a reminder of deadlines and expectations. I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my immediate attention, each carrying its own sense of responsibility and consequence. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between duty and compassion, between numbers and souls."}
