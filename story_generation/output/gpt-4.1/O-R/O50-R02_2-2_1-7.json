The sensor error had brought the entire line to a halt, and the plant manager\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford more downtime. We need you on this, now.\u201d My hands moved automatically, opening the panel, tracing wires, but my mind was elsewhere. In less than fifteen minutes, I was supposed to be at the parish hall, greeting a dozen eager children and their parents for our weekly religious education class. I could already picture Mrs. Larkin\u2019s worried glance at her watch, the children\u2019s restlessness, the expectation that I would be there to guide them, to share stories and faith. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014here, the urgent demand for technical expertise, livelihoods depending on my skill; there, the quiet but no less important need for spiritual guidance and community. My phone buzzed with a message from the church secretary: \u201cAre you on your way?\u201d I closed my eyes for a moment, torn between the hum of machines and the promise of gentle voices waiting for me."}
