As a doctor, I was about to meet the family of Mr. Goldstein, whose test results had just come in. The news was grave, and I knew I had to be clear, compassionate, and present for them. They deserved honesty, but also hope and support. My pager buzzed again\u2014a reminder that Sarah, my conversion student, was waiting in the synagogue library for our final study session before her Beit Din. As her rabbi, I was her guide, her reassurance, the one who would help her feel ready for this life-changing moment. Both families\u2014one by blood, one by faith\u2014needed me now, at the same time. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing on my chest. How could I be fully present for the Goldsteins in their pain, and also for Sarah in her anticipation? My mind raced, torn between my duty to heal and my calling to teach. I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, knowing I had to choose which door to open first."}
