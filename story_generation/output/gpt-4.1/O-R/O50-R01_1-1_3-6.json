Next week\u2019s shutdown was my window to clean and service the machines\u2014something I couldn\u2019t afford to miss. The factory depended on me to keep everything running smoothly, and I took pride in that responsibility. But as I wiped the grease from my hands, I remembered the community gathering that same week. I was expected to share a story, to teach and inspire, as their pastor. Last time, Mrs. Evans had told me how much the children looked forward to my stories, how they clung to every word. \n\nThe two roles tugged at me from opposite ends. The factory needed my hands, my technical mind. The congregation needed my heart, my words. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, the fear of letting someone down gnawing at me. I stared at the calendar, torn, the hum of the machines echoing in my ears as I wrestled with what to do."}
