As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before styling, but her hair was spotless, and she seemed in a hurry. I hesitated, torn between the salon\u2019s strict policy and her obvious preference.\n\nWhile I was debating, I overheard a heated conversation in the back room. Peeking in, I saw my manager slipping an envelope to a supplier\u2014money for products we never received. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to uphold dharma, to act with integrity and confront wrongdoing. But if I speak up, I risk my job and the trust of my colleagues.\n\nStanding there, I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I insist on washing Mrs. Patel\u2019s hair, following the rules, or respect her wishes? Should I expose the corruption I witnessed, or stay silent to protect my livelihood? The expectations of my profession and my faith clashed inside me, leaving me paralyzed, unsure which path to take."}
