My manager\u2019s eyes flick to the clock, reminding me that accuracy and speed are everything, especially during the Saturday rush. I can\u2019t afford mistakes; every transaction must be perfect. But as I ring up another basket, my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that church service starts in fifteen minutes. I promised my pastor I\u2019d help set up for the community lunch afterward, and I know my absence will be noticed. My heart aches with guilt; I want to be there, to worship and serve, to be the Christian I\u2019m expected to be. But I can\u2019t just abandon my post, not with so many people waiting and my coworkers already stretched thin. The weight of both roles presses down on me, each demanding my presence, each with its own expectations. I stare at the growing line, feeling torn, unsure which duty I should honor."}
