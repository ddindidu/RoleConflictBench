The contractor\u2019s email blinks insistently on my screen, urging me to sign off so construction can continue. But my eyes keep returning to a detail in the stairwell design\u2014a railing that\u2019s just a few centimeters too low. It\u2019s not up to code, and worse, it could be dangerous. My responsibility as an architect is clear: safety and compliance above all. Yet, as the clock ticks toward noon, I remember my commitment to pause for ten minutes of mindfulness, a daily practice that grounds me as a Buddhist. My phone vibrates with a calendar reminder: \u201cMeditation\u2014now.\u201d I feel the tension coil in my chest. If I stop to meditate, I\u2019ll delay the project and risk angering the team. If I push through, I betray my own need for stillness and presence. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding something I\u2019m not sure I can give at the same time. I close my eyes, caught between the urgent demands of my profession and the quiet call of my practice, unsure which voice to answer first."}
