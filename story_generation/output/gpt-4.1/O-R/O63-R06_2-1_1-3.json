The phone rings, and I launch into my pitch, but the prospect interrupts with a barrage of technical questions. My script only covers the basics, and I fumble for answers, feeling the pressure to keep the call going and handle every objection. My supervisor expects me to be confident, persuasive, and never admit uncertainty. Each call leaves me more drained, my mind racing with doubts about whether I\u2019m really helping anyone.\n\nAs I glance at the clock, I remember it\u2019s almost time for Sunday worship. I haven\u2019t been to church in weeks, always telling myself I\u2019ll go when work slows down. My church expects me to be present, to worship, to support the community. I miss the peace I feel there, the sense of belonging. But if I leave now, I\u2019ll miss my sales targets, and my manager will notice.
