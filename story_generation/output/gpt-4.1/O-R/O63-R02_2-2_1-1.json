The phone rang again, and I launched into my pitch, but the prospect quickly interrupted, asking about technical details I barely understood. My supervisor expected me to handle every objection, to keep the call going, to close the sale. I fumbled for answers, feeling the pressure mount as the minutes ticked by. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the main weekly service at the church was about to begin. As the priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, to be present for my community, to offer guidance and comfort. I glanced at the clock, torn between the demands of my job and my calling. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the customer\u2019s questions, but my mind kept drifting to the congregation gathering without me. The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be present, to be reliable. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I would let down."}
