My manager\u2019s eyes flick to me, silently urging me to keep the line moving, but the woman in front of me is furious about a coupon that won\u2019t scan. I force a smile, apologizing, trying to soothe her, even as my heart pounds with anxiety. Today is the most important religious holiday of the year, and as the community\u2019s priest, I am expected to lead the prayers and guide everyone through the sacred rituals. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014messages from parishioners asking if I\u2019ll be there soon. I glance at the clock; the service should have started already. The woman\u2019s voice rises, and I nod, apologizing again, but my mind is split. I am supposed to be a calm, patient cashier, but also a spiritual leader, present for my community. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I feel myself pulled in two directions, unable to see how I can possibly fulfill both roles at once."}
