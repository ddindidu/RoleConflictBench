I scan the radar, noting the empty holding patterns, the rare blip of a cargo flight gliding through. My headset sits lightly on my ears, but the airwaves are quiet. I should feel at ease, but my mind drifts to the afternoon ahead, when I\u2019ll trade my uniform for a habit and retreat to the convent\u2019s library. There, I\u2019m expected to immerse myself in spiritual reading, to reflect and renew my faith. The sisters trust I\u2019ll be present in mind and spirit, not just body.\n\nYet, as the sun rises, a message pings\u2014an unexpected surge of flights is predicted for later, and the supervisor asks if I can cover an extra shift. My heart tightens. The airspace needs me, but so does my soul. I feel the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders, the silent demand to be wholly present in two worlds that rarely meet. I stare at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the call of duty and the call of devotion, knowing I can\u2019t answer both."}
