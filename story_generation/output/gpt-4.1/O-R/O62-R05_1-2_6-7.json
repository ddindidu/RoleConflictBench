As a lifeguard, I was responsible for every splash and shout, making sure no one slipped into danger. Lately, I\u2019d noticed a group of kids sneaking into the shallow end when I was distracted, their parents chatting nearby, oblivious. I knew I had to enforce the rules, keep everyone safe, even if it meant being stern or unpopular.\n\nBut today, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the bar mitzvah. Months of preparation, a family counting on me to guide their child through this sacred milestone. As their rabbi, I was expected to be present, to lead with warmth and wisdom, to honor their trust in me. The ceremony was set to begin soon, and I could already picture the congregation gathering, waiting for me.\n\nMy heart pounded as I watched the swimmers, torn between the duty to protect lives here and the promise I\u2019d made to a family for their once-in-a-lifetime celebration. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which call to answer first."}
