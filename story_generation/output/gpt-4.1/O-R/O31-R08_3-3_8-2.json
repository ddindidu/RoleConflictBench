As a police officer, I knew my duty was clear: I must testify honestly, upholding the law with integrity and fairness. The trial was scheduled for tomorrow, and tonight I needed to review my notes, prepare my mind, and ensure my testimony would be precise and just. Yet, as a Muslim, tonight was also the weekly study circle at the mosque. The community would gather to recite and reflect on the Quran, and this week\u2019s verses were ones I hadn\u2019t yet read. I felt the weight of expectation from my faith\u2014to be present, to learn, to grow spiritually with my brothers and sisters. My heart tugged in two directions: the call of justice and the call of faith. I stared at the clock, feeling the pressure mount, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting down a part of myself and the people who depended on me."}
