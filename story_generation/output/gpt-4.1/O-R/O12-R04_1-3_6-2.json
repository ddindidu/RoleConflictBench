The UI glitch wasn\u2019t catastrophic, but it was embarrassing, and users were already grumbling in the forum. I knew I could patch it in under an hour if I started now. My phone buzzed\u2014another reminder that the mosque was filling up for the special remembrance. I was the only authorized imam present today, and the community expected me to lead the prayer. I could already picture the rows of worshippers, waiting, trusting I would be there. My manager\u2019s last email echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need this fixed before the next release.\u201d But the mosque committee had also stressed the importance of today\u2019s gathering, and I knew how much it meant to everyone. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, torn between the silent pressure of code and the living, breathing expectation of my community."}
