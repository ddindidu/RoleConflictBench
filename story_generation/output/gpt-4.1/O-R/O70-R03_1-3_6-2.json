My phone buzzed in my pocket for the third time\u2014another message from the mayor, pleading for help at the community center. As a nun, I was expected to drop everything and serve those in need, especially now, with the hurricane\u2019s devastation all around us. But as a delivery person, I had a route to finish, customers waiting, and a supervisor who expected professionalism and punctuality. The customer opened the door, looking impatient. I greeted her as warmly as I could, but my mind was racing. Should I apologize and rush to the relief center, or fulfill my duty here and risk being too late to help organize the charity effort? The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt torn, unable to satisfy either expectation without disappointing someone."}
