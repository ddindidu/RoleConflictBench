The message pops up: \u201cPlease hurry, I\u2019m late!\u201d My hands tighten on the steering wheel. I know what\u2019s expected of me: get there fast, be polite, help them make their appointment. That\u2019s my job, and I take pride in it. But my phone buzzes again, this time a text from my wife: \u201cThe kids are waiting. They need to practice the blessings for the holiday. Can you come home soon?\u201d The holiday is almost here, and I promised to teach them, to pass on the words my father taught me. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My passenger expects speed and service; my family expects guidance and tradition. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart aches as I picture my children waiting, their books open, eyes searching for me. The app pings again. I sit at a red light, torn, the city\u2019s noise blurring around me, caught between duty to a stranger and a promise to my own."}
