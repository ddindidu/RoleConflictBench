The package for Mrs. Lee sat on the seat beside me, and I rehearsed my usual polite greeting. As a delivery person, I\u2019m expected to be courteous, patient, and professional, no matter how rushed I feel. But my phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series at church was starting in ten minutes. As a priest, I\u2019m supposed to be present, prepared, and attentive, especially when guiding others in their faith. My mind raced\u2014if I took the time to chat with Mrs. Lee as she always liked, I\u2019d be late for the meeting. If I rushed the delivery, I\u2019d risk a complaint and let down my employer. I could already imagine the disappointment in my parishioners\u2019 faces if I missed the start of the meeting, and the frustration of my supervisor if I didn\u2019t handle the delivery with care. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I pulled up to Mrs. Lee\u2019s house, torn between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
