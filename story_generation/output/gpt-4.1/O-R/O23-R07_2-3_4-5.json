The contested motion for my client is scheduled in less than two hours. She\u2019s anxious, counting on me to defend her interests with every ounce of skill I possess. I review my notes, feeling the weight of her trust. But then my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder for the weekly meditation group. I\u2019m the leader, and the group depends on me to guide them through an hour of mindfulness, to help them find peace in their busy lives. I promised myself and my sangha that I would be present, calm, and attentive, not just physically but in spirit. The courthouse and the meditation hall are on opposite sides of town. My mind races, torn between the duty to my client and the commitment to my spiritual community. I feel the tension in my chest, the push and pull of two worlds that rarely meet. I close my eyes, searching for clarity, but the expectations of both roles press in, demanding an answer I\u2019m not ready to give."}
