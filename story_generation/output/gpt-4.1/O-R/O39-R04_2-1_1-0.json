The carpenter called out, impatience in his voice, \u201cHurry up, I need those boards!\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of the wood and his expectations. My hands were rough, my shirt stained, but my mind was elsewhere. The noon prayer was approaching, and I was supposed to lead it at the mosque just down the street. I knew the congregation would be small today, and Brother Yusuf, always punctual, could easily step in. Still, I felt the tug of duty\u2014my role as imam was not just about reciting verses, but about being present, a source of comfort and guidance. Yet here, on the site, my absence would slow the whole crew. The foreman\u2019s eyes were on me, and the carpenter\u2019s hammer tapped impatiently. I stood between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to put them first. My heart pounded, torn by the weight of both callings, as the minutes slipped away."}
