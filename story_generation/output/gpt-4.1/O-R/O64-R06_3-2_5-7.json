My hands ached as I counted the bills for the end-of-day deposit, double-checking every number to make sure I followed the strict procedures. The manager always reminded us\u2014no shortcuts, no distractions, or we\u2019d risk an audit. As I was about to seal the deposit bag, I saw Maria, a regular customer and someone from my church, standing by the counter. Her eyes were red, and she looked lost. I remembered the sermon from last Sunday\u2014how we\u2019re called to show love and kindness, to be present for those in need. Maria\u2019s voice trembled as she asked if I had a moment. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of the store\u2019s expectations pressing on me. If I stopped now, I\u2019d break protocol and risk my job. But if I turned her away, I\u2019d be ignoring everything I believed about compassion. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the rules of my workplace and the teachings of my faith, unsure which voice to follow."}
