The package in the passenger seat was supposed to be delivered by noon, but traffic had slowed me down. It was now 12:30, and I was just pulling up to the address. I knew the customer had been waiting, probably watching the window, expecting me to be on time. As a delivery person, punctuality was everything\u2014one late package could mean a complaint, a bad review, or worse, a reprimand from my supervisor.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: in fifteen minutes, I was supposed to meet with Mrs. Carter at the church. She\u2019d called me last night, her voice trembling, asking for guidance. As her priest, I was her confidant, her support in a time of need. She was counting on me to listen, to offer comfort and wisdom.\n\nI sat in my car, torn. If I delivered the package now, I\u2019d be late for Mrs. Carter. If I left for the church, the delivery would be even later. Both roles demanded my presence, my reliability. I gripped the steering wheel, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
