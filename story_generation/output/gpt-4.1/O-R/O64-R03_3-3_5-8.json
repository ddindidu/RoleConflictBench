My hands ached as I counted the bills for the end-of-day deposit, double-checking every number to follow the strict procedures. The manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts, or we risk an audit.\u201d I knew the rules, and I knew the consequences if I made a mistake.

She had entrusted me to lead the community in spiritual reflection\u2014a role I cherished, a calling I could not ignore.
