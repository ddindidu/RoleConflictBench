The new safety standard had just come into effect, and as the lead engineer, it was my responsibility to ensure our product met every requirement before tomorrow\u2019s release. The compliance team was waiting for my final review, and the documentation still needed my signature. Missing this deadline could mean a costly delay for the company and a blow to my professional reputation.\n\nMy phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque committee: \u201cBackup imam is out sick. Can you lead Maghrib tonight? Everyone is expecting you.\u201d I glanced at the prayer times\u2014Maghrib was less than an hour away. I knew the congregation counted on me, especially when the regular imam was absent. Leading the prayer was not just a duty, but a trust, a spiritual anchor for the community.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My mind raced with the expectations\u2014my team\u2019s anxious faces, the congregation\u2019s hopeful eyes. I could not be in two places at once. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which responsibility I would have to let down."}
