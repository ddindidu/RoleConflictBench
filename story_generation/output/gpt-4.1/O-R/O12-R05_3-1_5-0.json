The architects from the payments and analytics teams are pinging me, waiting for my input on the new feature specs. The launch date was just moved up, and now everyone\u2019s blocked until I make some decisions. My manager\u2019s message is clear: \u201cWe need your answers today.\u201d I feel the pressure mounting, knowing that any delay on my part will ripple through the whole project.\n\nBut as I try to focus, my mind drifts to my other responsibility. Shabbat is coming, and I haven\u2019t even started brainstorming topics for my sermon. The congregation expects thoughtful, relevant messages, and I know how much these weekly teachings mean to them. I promised myself I\u2019d set aside time to reflect and prepare, but now, with the product launch looming, I can\u2019t seem to find a moment\u2019s peace.\n\nI feel torn, pulled in two directions by people who rely on me for completely different things. My heart aches with the weight of their expectations, and I wonder how I can possibly meet them both."}
