My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the passenger who\u2019d booked me through the app, their words urgent: \u201cPlease hurry, I\u2019m late!\u201d As a taxi driver, I knew the expectation\u2014timeliness, professionalism, and a calm, courteous ride. I prided myself on delivering that, even when the city\u2019s traffic conspired against me.\n\nBut today, my mind was split. In less than thirty minutes, my weekly group meditation would begin. As a Buddhist, this hour was sacred\u2014a time to practice mindfulness, to let go of worldly concerns, to sit in stillness with my sangha. I could already picture the quiet room, the gentle chime of the bell, the collective breath of the group. Missing it felt like betraying a promise to myself and my spiritual path.\n\nYet here I was, caught between the demands of my livelihood and the call of my practice. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, heart pounding as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides. The city\u2019s noise seemed louder, my thoughts more chaotic, as I wrestled with what to do next."}
