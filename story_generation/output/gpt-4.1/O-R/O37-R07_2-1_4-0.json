My client, Mrs. Tan, always expected the house to be spotless, and I prided myself on never letting her down. The next cleaning was in three days, and I knew I should pick up more supplies before then. But tonight was the temple\u2019s evening chant, a ritual I rarely missed. The community counted on me to help set up the cushions and lead the prayers. My teacher often reminded us that commitment to the sangha was as important as personal practice. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014Mrs. Tan\u2019s trust in my reliability, and my own devotion to the Buddhist path. The store would close soon, and the temple bell would ring in less than an hour. My mind raced, torn between the quiet peace of the temple and the practical duty of my work. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding, uncertain which door I would walk through next."}
