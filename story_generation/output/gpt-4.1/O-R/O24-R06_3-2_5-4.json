The defendant\u2019s anxious face haunted me as I reviewed my notes, knowing I needed to draft the release order immediately. The law demanded clarity and precision\u2014every condition, every word, had to be exact. The defendant\u2019s freedom depended on it, and any delay could mean another night in custody. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. The church bells would soon ring, calling the congregation to worship. I had promised myself, and my faith, to be present every week, to join in prayer and fellowship, to serve as a visible part of my Christian community. My absence would be noticed, and I felt the weight of letting down those who counted on me.
