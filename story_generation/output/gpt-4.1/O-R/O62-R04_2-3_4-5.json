As I walked along the edge, I noticed a lane rope had snapped, its frayed ends floating in the water. Swim lessons would start in less than an hour, and without that rope, the class would be chaotic and unsafe. My duty as a lifeguard was clear: I needed to fix it immediately, ensuring the safety and order of the pool. But as I reached for the maintenance kit, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014today was the special Friday sermon. Families from neighboring towns were already gathering at the mosque, waiting to hear my words on this important day. As the imam, I was expected to deliver a meaningful khutbah, especially with so many guests present. My heart pounded as I stood between the pool and the mosque, torn by the weight of both responsibilities, knowing that whichever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
