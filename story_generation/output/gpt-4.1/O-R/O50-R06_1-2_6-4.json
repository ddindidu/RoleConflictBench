It was a new client, sounding a bit anxious, asking if I could walk them through some basic machine operations. As a machine repairer, I know how important it is to support clients, especially those just starting out. My company expects me to be available and helpful, and I take pride in making sure people feel confident using our equipment. But as a Christian, Sunday mornings are sacred. Attending church isn\u2019t just a routine\u2014it\u2019s a commitment to my faith and my community. I could hear the choir warming up in my mind, the familiar comfort of worship calling me. Yet, on the other end of the line, the client\u2019s uncertainty tugged at my sense of responsibility. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in. Should I stay on the call and guide the client, or should I head out the door to join my church family? The clock ticked, and my heart pounded as I wrestled with the expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
