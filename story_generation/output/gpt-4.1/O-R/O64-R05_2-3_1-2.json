My fingers move quickly over the register, scanning items, counting change, trying not to make a mistake. The manager\u2019s eyes flick to me every few minutes\u2014accuracy and speed, that\u2019s what\u2019s expected. But my mind keeps drifting to the sermon I haven\u2019t finished. Tonight is the High Holiday service, and the congregation will be waiting for words of comfort and inspiration. As a rabbi, I\u2019m supposed to be prepared, present, spiritually focused. Instead, I\u2019m here, trapped behind the counter, my thoughts split between the beep of barcodes and the sacred texts I should be reviewing. Each customer\u2019s impatient sigh feels like a reminder that I\u2019m failing both roles. I want to do right by my employer, but I also feel the weight of my community\u2019s expectations. The clock ticks closer to the service, and I\u2019m still stuck, wrestling with the impossible choice between duty to my job and duty to my faith."}
