The line of customers had finally thinned, but the manager reminded me that tonight was my turn to handle the large cash deposit. I knew the drill: count every bill, fill out the forms, double-check the safe, and sign off with a supervisor. It was tedious, but the store\u2019s policies were strict\u2014no shortcuts, no mistakes, or the audit team would be on us in a heartbeat.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a calendar alert: the adult faith formation planning meeting at the parish started at 6:15. As the priest, I was expected to lead, to inspire, to be present for the volunteers who looked to me for guidance. They\u2019d been waiting for weeks to get started, and I\u2019d promised to be there on time.\n\nMy hands trembled as I counted the bills, my mind torn between the store\u2019s procedures and the parish\u2019s needs. I could feel the weight of both uniforms pressing on me, the apron and the collar, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
