As an accountant, I knew the gravity of a letter from the tax authority\u2014every minute counted, and a delayed response could mean penalties for my client. My mind raced through spreadsheets and regulations, searching for the source of the discrepancy. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from Brother Ahmed, a long-time congregant. He pleaded for a private meeting, his words heavy with desperation about his family\u2019s turmoil. As the imam, I was his anchor, the one he trusted for guidance and comfort. Both roles demanded my immediate attention: the tax issue required my analytical focus and swift action, while Ahmed needed my compassion and presence. I felt the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides, my heart torn between the urgent call of my profession and the sacred trust of my community. I stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
