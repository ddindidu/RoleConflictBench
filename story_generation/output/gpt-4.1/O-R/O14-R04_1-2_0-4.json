The new equipment had finally arrived, and the team was eager to see if our hypothesis would hold. I knew the experiment could be rescheduled, but the momentum was building, and my colleagues were counting on me to lead. Yet, as I glanced at my phone, a reminder flashed: \u201cKhutbah, Friday, 1:00 PM.\u201d The mosque had already announced my topic\u2014\u201cScience and Faith: Bridging Worlds\u201d\u2014and I was the only imam available this week. The community expected me to guide them, to offer wisdom and reassurance, especially now when so many were seeking answers. My mind raced, torn between the pursuit of knowledge in the lab and the spiritual guidance I owed my congregation. Both roles demanded my presence, my commitment. I felt the weight of expectation pressing from both sides, my heart pounding as I tried to imagine disappointing either my colleagues or my community."}
