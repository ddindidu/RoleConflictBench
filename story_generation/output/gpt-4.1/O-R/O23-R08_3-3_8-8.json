My phone buzzed with a message from the opposing counsel, pressing again for information I knew was protected by client confidentiality. The pressure was mounting; they hinted at consequences for my client if I didn\u2019t cooperate, and the weight of my professional oath pressed heavily on my shoulders. At the same time, my doctor\u2019s words replayed in my mind: \u201cIf you want to perform Hajj, this year may be your last chance.\u201d My family\u2019s hopeful faces, the longing in my own heart to fulfill this pillar of my faith, clashed with the urgent demands of my case. I felt torn\u2014my duty to my client and the law on one side, my spiritual obligation and the fleeting window of health on the other. The clock ticked, and I stared at the two emails on my screen, each representing a world of expectation I could not ignore. My hands trembled as I realized I could not satisfy both."}
