The siren wailed, echoing my own racing heart. The patient in the back was barely conscious, and every second counted, but the rain hammered down so hard I could barely see the road. I knew I had to drive carefully\u2014one wrong move on these slick roads, and we\u2019d all be in danger. Suddenly, my phone buzzed. It was a desperate message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was waiting at the hospital, needing guidance about a life-altering decision. As her pastor, I was expected to offer comfort and wisdom, to be present and listen. But as the ambulance driver, I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off the road, couldn\u2019t risk a distraction.
