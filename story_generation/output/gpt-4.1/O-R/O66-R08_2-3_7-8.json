As a taxi driver, I knew what was expected of me: help them load their bags, make them comfortable, and ensure a smooth ride. They smiled gratefully, explaining they\u2019d split the fare, and I nodded, already calculating the best route. But my mind kept drifting to the letter from my doctor, the one that said my health might not allow me to travel much longer. As a Muslim, the call to perform Hajj weighed heavily on my heart\u2014this year might be my only chance. Yet, every day I drove meant more money for my family, but also another day lost from preparing for the pilgrimage. The travelers\u2019 voices pulled me back, asking if I could hurry. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the duty to my passengers and the sacred journey I might never get to make."}
