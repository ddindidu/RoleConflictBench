She\u2019s a regular at church, and her eyes are red, her hands trembling as she clutches a loaf of bread. I know she\u2019s been having a hard time at home. As a cashier, I\u2019m expected to keep the line moving, to be efficient and friendly, not to hold up impatient customers. But as her pastor, I feel the weight of her pain, the silent plea for comfort in her gaze. The line behind her grows, customers shifting and sighing, but Mrs. Carter\u2019s voice is barely a whisper as she asks if I have a moment. My heart aches\u2014I want to step away, to offer her the support she needs, but I can\u2019t ignore the growing frustration of the crowd. I stand there, torn, the beep of the scanner and the hum of the store clashing with the quiet desperation in her eyes, unsure which role I am supposed to serve first."}
