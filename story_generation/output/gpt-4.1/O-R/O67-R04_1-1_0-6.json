My uniform felt heavy, a constant reminder of the responsibility to respond instantly, to save lives. Just then, Brother Yusuf from the community walked by, pausing at the open window. \u201cImam, if you have a moment, I could really use your advice,\u201d he said, his voice low, eyes troubled. I saw the weight he carried, the kind that needed more than a quick word. As an imam, I knew I should offer him my full attention, listen deeply, and guide him with compassion. But as an ambulance driver, I couldn\u2019t risk being distracted or delayed if a call came in. My mind raced\u2014should I invite him in, risking a late response to a possible emergency, or ask him to wait, knowing he might feel abandoned in his moment of need? The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding urgency, each too important to ignore. I gripped the steering wheel, heart pounding, torn between the siren\u2019s call and the quiet plea for guidance."}
