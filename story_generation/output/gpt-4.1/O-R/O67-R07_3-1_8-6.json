My hands gripped the wheel, knuckles white, as I navigated the ambulance through the storm. The patient in the back was fading fast, every second precious. I knew I had to drive carefully\u2014one wrong move on these slick roads could end it all. My phone buzzed in the cupholder. It was my friend, a fellow Buddhist, asking if I could talk about the sermon we\u2019d heard last night. He said he was struggling with some of the teachings and needed my perspective. I felt the tug immediately. As a Buddhist, I should be present, compassionate, and available for spiritual reflection, especially for a friend in need. But as an ambulance driver, my focus had to be absolute, every sense tuned to the road and the life in my care. The storm raged outside and within me, the demands of both roles crashing together. I stared at the phone, heart pounding, torn between the urgent needs of the world and the quiet call of the spirit."}
