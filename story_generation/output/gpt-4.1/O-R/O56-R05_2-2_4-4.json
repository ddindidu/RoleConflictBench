She was a first-time client, and I could see the uncertainty in her eyes as she studied her reflection. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit\u2026 warmer than I expected,\u201d she said quietly, her fingers twisting a strand. My heart sank. As a hairdresser, I knew I needed to listen, reassure her, and maybe even redo the colour if she wasn\u2019t happy. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the children\u2019s Torah class at the synagogue was starting in fifteen minutes. As the rabbi, I was expected to be there, to guide the children through this week\u2019s parsha, to answer their questions and nurture their curiosity. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014Miriam\u2019s anxious glance, the children waiting for their lesson, the community\u2019s trust. My mind raced, torn between staying to fix Miriam\u2019s hair and rushing to fulfill my duty as a teacher of Torah. I stood there, scissors in hand, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
