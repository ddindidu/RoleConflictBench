As a lifeguard, I knew my job was to watch every swimmer, never letting my attention slip. A few kids drifted toward the deep end, but they seemed fine for now. Still, I couldn\u2019t let my guard down. Just then, an older woman approached the poolside, struggling with her bag and cane. She looked at me, hopeful, maybe needing help. My heart tugged\u2014my faith taught me to show kindness, to help those in need, just as Jesus would. But if I left my post, even for a moment, I\u2019d risk missing something in the water. The rules were clear: never leave the pool unsupervised. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. I wanted to help her, to live out my faith, but I also had a duty to protect everyone in the pool. My hands gripped the chair, my mind racing, caught between the expectations of my job and my beliefs."}
