The specialized instrument I\u2019d waited months to use was finally available, but only for a few precious hours. My experiment, the culmination of years of work, depended on this window. As I prepared my samples, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my church group: one of our members, Mrs. Evans, had just lost her husband. She was alone, devastated, and needed someone to be with her. I felt the weight of my lab coat and the cross around my neck. As a scientist, I was expected to seize this rare opportunity, to gather the data that could define my career. But as a Christian, I was called to show compassion, to be present for someone in pain. The demands pressed in from both sides, my hands trembling as I tried to focus. I could almost hear the echo of my mentor\u2019s voice urging me to stay, and my pastor\u2019s gentle reminder to love others above all. My heart pounded as I stood between the lab bench and the door, torn by the impossible choice."}
