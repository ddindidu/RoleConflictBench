As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to take my scheduled break at exactly 2:00 PM, no exceptions. Management watches the break logs like hawks, and I know if I\u2019m late, I\u2019ll get a warning. But just as I\u2019m about to log out, a call comes through\u2014an elderly woman, her voice trembling, asks for help with a product she can\u2019t afford. She\u2019s desperate, and I can hear the worry in her words. My Christian values tell me to show compassion, to listen, to help her find a solution that won\u2019t take advantage of her vulnerability. But the clock is ticking, and if I stay on the line, I\u2019ll be late for my break, risking my job. If I end the call abruptly, I\u2019ll betray the kindness and honesty my faith demands. My heart pounds as I sit at the crossroads of duty and conscience, torn between the rules of my workplace and the teachings I hold dear."}
