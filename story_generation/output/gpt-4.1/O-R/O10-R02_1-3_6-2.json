As an accountant, I knew the importance of timely communication\u2014especially with vendors. This morning, a vendor had sent an automated confirmation for a recent payment, and protocol demanded I send a formal reply before the end of business hours. My phone buzzed with reminders, and I could already imagine the vendor\u2019s polite but firm follow-up if I delayed.\n\nBut today was also the most significant religious holiday of the year. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers and rituals, to be present for every member who would fill the temple. The anticipation in the air was palpable; people had been preparing for weeks, and my absence would be noticed, even felt as a disappointment.\n\nI glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. The pressure of both roles pressed in on me\u2014one demanding professionalism and promptness, the other calling for spiritual leadership and presence. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations, torn between duty to my profession and devotion to my faith."}
