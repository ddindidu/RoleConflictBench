A young woman lay on the gurney, her fever raging, infection spreading rapidly beneath her skin. As a doctor, I knew every second counted; she needed antibiotics now, and I was the only attending physician on shift. My pager buzzed again\u2014this time, a gentle reminder from the chapel. The daily prayer service was about to begin, and as the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead it. People would be gathering, waiting for my words, seeking comfort and guidance. I could almost hear the soft hum of their voices, the expectation in their eyes. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds. If I left the patient, I risked her life. If I missed the service, I would let down my congregation, who relied on me for spiritual support. Torn between the urgent call of medicine and the quiet pull of faith, I stood frozen, the demands of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which path to take."}
