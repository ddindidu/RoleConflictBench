The foreman\u2019s words from yesterday echoed in my mind: \u201cWe start at seven sharp. No exceptions. And don\u2019t cut corners\u2014safety first.\u201d I knew the risks; one careless moment could mean disaster. As I pulled on my hard hat, my phone buzzed. It was Mrs. Ramirez from church, her message urgent: \u201cPastor, can you come? My son is in trouble. We need you.\u201d My heart clenched. She\u2019d lost her husband last year, and her son had been drifting. I was their anchor, their hope. But if I left now, I\u2019d let down my crew, risk a reprimand, maybe even someone\u2019s safety. If I stayed, I\u2019d fail a family in crisis, betray my calling to shepherd those in need. The weight of my dual responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each unforgiving of absence. I stood at the edge of the site, torn between the hammer in my hand and the call in my heart, unable to move."}
