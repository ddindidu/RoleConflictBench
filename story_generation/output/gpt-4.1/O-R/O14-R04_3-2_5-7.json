The journal\u2019s deadline was tonight, and my team was counting on me to submit our findings\u2014every detail had to be precise, every claim supported. My phone buzzed. It was Ahmed, a congregant I\u2019d known for years. His message was brief but heavy: \u201cImam, can we talk? It\u2019s urgent. My family is falling apart.\u201d I knew what he needed\u2014someone to listen, to offer comfort and guidance, to be present in his moment of crisis.

My mind raced, torn between the duty to my research and the responsibility to my community. Both roles demanded my presence, my care, my integrity.
