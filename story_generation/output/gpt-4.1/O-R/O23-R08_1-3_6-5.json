A colleague, drink in hand, leaned in and asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019s the real story with your new client? I\u2019ve heard rumors.\u201d My mind raced\u2014client confidentiality was sacred in my profession, and I could never betray that trust, not even in passing conversation. I smiled politely, deflecting, but the question lingered in the air.\n\nAs the event wound down, I glanced at my watch. It was almost time for Friday prayers. I hurried to the mosque nearby, but as I reached the entrance, I realized I was still in my business suit\u2014tailored, but not quite in line with the modesty I strive for as a Muslim. The prayer hall was filling up, and I felt the weight of expectation from my faith to present myself modestly before God.
