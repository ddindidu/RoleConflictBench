The group session was about to start, and I\u2019d been looking forward to this hour of stillness all week. Just as I was about to silence my phone, a message popped up from a customer: \u201cWhere is my package? It\u2019s late!\u201d My heart sank. As a delivery person, I\u2019m expected to respond quickly and politely, no matter how stressed or tired I am. I could already imagine the customer\u2019s impatience growing with every minute I delayed. But as a Buddhist, I\u2019m supposed to let go of distractions, to be fully present, especially during meditation. The group was gathering inside, their voices soft and welcoming. I felt torn\u2014my job demanded immediate attention and professionalism, but my spiritual practice called for undisturbed mindfulness. My fingers hovered over the phone, my mind racing between duty and devotion, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
