My shift had ended, and for once, I looked forward to a quiet night. As a police officer, I rarely had such moments\u2014usually, duty called at all hours. Tonight, I planned to recite and reflect on the Quran, something I cherished but often postponed due to work. Just as I opened the holy book, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the station: I was needed in court tomorrow morning to provide testimony in a case I\u2019d investigated. The expectation was clear\u2014my integrity and fairness as an officer were on the line, and my presence could make a difference. Yet, I felt a pang of disappointment. I had hoped to spend the evening in spiritual reflection, fulfilling my duty as a Muslim. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each important in its own right. I stared at the Quran, then at my badge, torn between the call of faith and the call of duty, unsure which to answer first."}
