My client\u2019s future\u2014and a substantial sum\u2014rested on my ability to represent them without distraction. The judge had made it clear: no delays, no excuses. Every moment of preparation mattered. Yet, as I glanced at my calendar, my heart tightened. Sunday was the second day of trial, and I hadn\u2019t missed a church service in years. My faith was my anchor, and worship with my community was more than a routine; it was a commitment I cherished deeply. I could already imagine the disappointment in my pastor\u2019s eyes, the gentle questions from friends if I didn\u2019t show up. The weight of my client\u2019s trust pressed on one side, the pull of my faith on the other. I sat at my desk, torn, the expectations of both worlds colliding inside me, unsure which voice to heed."}
