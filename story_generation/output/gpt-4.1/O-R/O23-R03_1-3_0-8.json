As a lawyer, I knew I should review it thoroughly, even if the deadline was weeks away. My client trusted me to catch every nuance, every potential pitfall. Yet, the quiet of the convent pressed in around me, and I could hear the distant echo of the chapel bell. The Mother Superior had just asked me to lead daily reflections for the retreat\u2014a sacred responsibility. The sisters would look to me for guidance, for words that would nourish their spirits. I felt the weight of their expectations, the need to immerse myself in scripture and prayer, to prepare my heart and mind.
