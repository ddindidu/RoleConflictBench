The package had arrived at the depot later than expected, but I could still get it to the customer before the end of the day. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cOn time, every time. No excuses.\u201d I started the van, but my thoughts drifted to my other life\u2014the one where I stood before my congregation as their rabbi. Shabbat was weeks away, but I knew I should be brainstorming sermon topics now, letting ideas simmer so I could offer something meaningful. My community expected wisdom, preparation, and presence. Yet here I was, hands on the wheel, mind split in two. If I focused on the delivery, I\u2019d have no time tonight to reflect or jot down ideas. If I paused to brainstorm, I\u2019d risk a late delivery and a disappointed customer. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I sat in the van, keys in the ignition, torn between the ticking clock and the silent call to serve."}
