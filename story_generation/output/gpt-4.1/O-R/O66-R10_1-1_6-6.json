As I turned a corner, the sound of drums and laughter caught my attention. It was the annual Ganesh Chaturthi festival, and the street was alive with color and devotion. My heart ached to join, to offer prayers and feel the warmth of the community. But I had a passenger waiting at the next block, and I knew my duty was to deliver a professional service, to be punctual and keep my cab ready for the next ride. I slowed down, torn between stepping out to join the aarti and staying behind the wheel, glancing at the garland of marigolds on my dashboard. The scent of incense drifted in through the window, mingling with the lemony air freshener, and I felt the pull of both worlds\u2014one demanding my presence as a devoted Hindu, the other as a responsible taxi driver. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I wrestled with what to do next."}
