The radar screen is almost empty, just a few blips gliding through the sky. I savor the calm, knowing it won\u2019t last. My headset crackles, but it\u2019s routine\u2014no emergencies, no congestion, just the hum of engines and the slow dance of navigation lights. Yet, my mind isn\u2019t fully here. My phone vibrates with a message from Brother Yusuf, a long-time congregant. He\u2019s desperate, asking if I can meet him soon. His family is falling apart, and he needs guidance\u2014my guidance. As an imam, I know the weight of his request. He trusts me to help him find peace, to listen, to offer counsel rooted in faith. But I can\u2019t just leave the tower, not even in this lull. The expectation is clear: I must be vigilant, ready for any sudden change in the airspace. My heart aches with the pull of both duties. I stare at the radar, feeling the pressure build, torn between the silent responsibility above and the urgent plea below, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
