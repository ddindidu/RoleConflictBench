I know I need to study every measurement and joint before dawn, or tomorrow\u2019s build will be a disaster. My mind is already racing with angles and wood types when my phone buzzes. It\u2019s Sarah from church, her voice trembling. She\u2019s facing a decision that could change her family\u2019s life, and she needs guidance\u2014tonight. As her pastor, I know she expects me to listen, pray, and help her find clarity.
