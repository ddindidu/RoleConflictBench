Suddenly, my clerk slipped me a note\u2014urgent, in bold. The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was referencing. My mind raced. I knew I had to halt the proceedings, review the new ruling, and ensure justice was served according to the latest law. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart clenched. The chapel bell was ringing; it was time for morning prayers. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to join my sisters in devotion, to uphold the discipline of our sacred routine. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my duty to the law, to the people in this courtroom, and my commitment to God, to the quiet sanctuary of prayer. I felt torn, standing between the demands of justice and the call to spiritual obedience, uncertain which path to follow in this moment."}
