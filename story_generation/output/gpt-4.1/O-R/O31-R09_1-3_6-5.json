As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness\u2014no favoritism, no bending the rules. The law was clear, but I also knew the owner: Mrs. Goldstein, a pillar of our synagogue, who had parked there only because the lot was full for the big event inside. I could use my discretion, but would that be fair to others?\n\nInside, the aroma of food drifted out, making my stomach rumble. I hadn\u2019t eaten since morning, and the spread looked inviting. But as a Jew, I was expected to observe kosher dietary laws, and I couldn\u2019t find any certification on the dishes. Substituting food would be difficult; I didn\u2019t want to offend the hosts or draw attention to myself, but I also didn\u2019t want to compromise my beliefs.\n\nI felt the weight of both uniforms I wore\u2014one blue, one invisible\u2014each demanding something different. My hand hovered over the ticket pad, my eyes on the buffet table, caught between the expectations of my badge and my faith, unsure which to honor in this moment."}
