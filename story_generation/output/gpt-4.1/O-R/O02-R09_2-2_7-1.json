My manager\u2019s email sits unread, subject line urgent: \u201cNeed your estimates for Q3 by tomorrow.\u201d I know the team is waiting on me to finalize the roadmap, and I can already hear the questions in tomorrow\u2019s meeting\u2014how long will the new feature take, can we deliver on time? I\u2019m supposed to be the reliable one, the engineer who always gives clear, accurate answers.\n\nBut my mind keeps drifting to the kitchen table, where my kids are waiting for me with their siddurim open. Passover is just days away, and they still stumble over the Four Questions. I promised my wife I\u2019d help them tonight, teach them the blessings, share the stories my father told me. It\u2019s not just about tradition\u2014it\u2019s about giving them a sense of who they are.\n\nI feel the pressure mounting from both sides. My team needs my focus, my family needs my presence. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and I can\u2019t shake the guilt that, whichever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
