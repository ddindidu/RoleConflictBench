The radio crackles\u2014there\u2019s a minor delay at the next station. I know what\u2019s expected: keep the train safe, adjust my speed, avoid sudden stops. The passengers trust me to get them home on time, and I feel the weight of their silent expectations with every turn of the track. But my mind drifts to the Quran resting in my bag. Tonight, the community study circle gathers, and I\u2019m supposed to have read and reflected on the verses we\u2019ll discuss. I haven\u2019t had the time. My shift ends just before the meeting, and I\u2019d planned to read during my break, but the delay ate up those precious minutes. I feel torn\u2014my duty to these passengers is clear, but so is my commitment to my faith and my community. The train hums forward, and I wrestle with the guilt of not being fully prepared for either role, wondering how I can meet the demands of both when they pull me in opposite directions."}
