The court hearing was scheduled for Friday at 1:30 p.m.\u2014a minor procedural matter, nothing urgent, and I knew I could request a postponement without much trouble. Yet, as a lawyer, I felt the weight of my client\u2019s trust, their expectation that I would be present, attentive, and professional, no matter how small the case.\n\nBut Friday was also the day I was to deliver the Khutbah at the mosque. The congregation looked to me for guidance, for words that would inspire and comfort them. I had spent the week preparing, but I also knew that a guest speaker was ready to step in if I couldn\u2019t make it. Still, the thought of not being there, of letting down the community, gnawed at me.\n\nI felt torn, pulled by the duty to my client and the responsibility to my congregation. Both roles demanded my presence, my commitment. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations, knowing that whatever I chose, I would disappoint someone who counted on me."}
