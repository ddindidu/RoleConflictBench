The store was quiet, and I took pride in making everyone feel welcome, exchanging small talk and ensuring their experience was pleasant. My manager always said that friendly service was what kept people coming back, and I believed it. But as I handed a receipt to an elderly woman, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the Friday prayer was only an hour away. Today was special; our community was celebrating a milestone, and people had travelled from neighboring towns to hear my sermon. As the imam, I was expected to deliver words of guidance and inspiration, to be present and focused for my congregation. Yet here I was, still in my cashier\u2019s apron, with a line of customers forming and no sign of my replacement. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock, torn between the duty to my job and the responsibility to my community. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt myself caught in the middle, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
