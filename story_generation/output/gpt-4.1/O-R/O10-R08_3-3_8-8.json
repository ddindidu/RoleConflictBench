As the company\u2019s accountant, it was my job to keep these relationships smooth, to ensure the business ran without interruption. My manager expected me to resolve this, to negotiate, to find the funds\u2014anything to keep the supply chain intact. But my mind kept drifting to the letter from my doctor, the one that said my health was declining, that if I wanted to perform Hajj, it had to be this year. As a Muslim, this was a sacred duty, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation. My family was counting on me to fulfill it, and my heart ached at the thought of missing this chance.

The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. I stared at the calendar, torn between duty and devotion, unable to see a path that honored both."}
