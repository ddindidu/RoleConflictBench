I checked the readout\u2014pressure was spiking, a sign of possible leakage. My training as a scientist kicked in: safety protocols demanded immediate attention, a thorough check, and perhaps even an emergency shutdown. But as I reached for my lab coat, my phone vibrated with a gentle reminder: the evening chant at the temple would begin in fifteen minutes. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be present, to join the community in ritual and reflection, to set aside worldly concerns and cultivate mindfulness. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds. If I left now, I risked the safety of the lab and everyone in it. If I stayed, I would miss the ceremony, disappointing my teacher and fellow practitioners, and perhaps myself. The sterile hum of the lab clashed with the imagined resonance of temple bells, and I stood frozen, torn between duty and devotion, unable to move."}
