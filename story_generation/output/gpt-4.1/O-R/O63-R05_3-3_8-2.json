My telemarketing shift was strict\u2014every minute accounted for, every break scheduled. The compliance system watched us all, ready to flag any unscheduled pause. I glanced at the clock. In just an hour, I was supposed to be at the synagogue, standing before my congregation to deliver the High Holiday sermon I\u2019d spent weeks preparing. They expected inspiration, guidance, a sense of community\u2014especially today. But my shift didn\u2019t end for another two hours, and if I left early, even by a few minutes, the system would log it. I could face disciplinary action, maybe even lose my job. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands: the congregation waiting for their rabbi, the supervisor monitoring every second of my telemarketing role. I felt pulled apart, the expectations of both worlds pressing in, and I didn\u2019t know which part of myself I could let down."}
