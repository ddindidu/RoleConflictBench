As a police officer, my duty was clear: protect the injured, keep the road safe, and restore order. My radio crackled with updates, and I could see the anxious faces of bystanders, waiting for reassurance. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the workshop I\u2019d spent weeks preparing as a pastor was about to begin. Community leaders were gathering at the church, expecting me to guide them through challenging theological discussions, to help them grow in faith and understanding. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me: the badge demanding my presence at the scene, the collar calling me to shepherd my flock. My heart pounded with the knowledge that wherever I went, I would be letting someone down. I stood at the crossroads, torn between the urgent needs of the accident and the spiritual needs of my community, unsure which path to take."}
