My manager expected me to be friendly, efficient, and present for every customer, no matter how slow the day was. Just as I finished with the last customer, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the church secretary: \u201cSomeone is here, very upset, asking for you. Says it\u2019s urgent.\u201d My heart clenched. As a priest, I was supposed to be there for people in crisis, to offer comfort and guidance when they needed it most. But I was still on shift, and my manager frowned on any distractions. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me. The store was quiet, but I couldn\u2019t just leave. Yet, someone was waiting for me, desperate for help. I gripped the counter, torn between the expectations of kindness at the register and the deeper call to serve a soul in pain."}
