It\u2019s a slow afternoon, just a few customers drifting in and out, their faces familiar. My shift is supposed to end in ten minutes, but the new cashier called in sick, and my manager asks if I can stay a little longer. I glance at the clock. The weekly meditation group meets in fifteen minutes\u2014a sacred hour I look forward to all week, a time to practice mindfulness and reconnect with my breath. As a cashier, I know I\u2019m expected to process every transaction accurately, to stay until the last customer is helped, to be reliable. But as a Buddhist, I feel the pull of my commitment to meditation, the promise I made to myself to nurture inner peace. My mind races, torn between the steady rhythm of the register and the quiet sanctuary waiting for me. I feel the tension knotting in my chest, the weight of two worlds pressing in, each demanding something I\u2019m not sure I can give."}
