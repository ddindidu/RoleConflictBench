The new staff clustered around the control panel, their faces anxious, waiting for my guidance before starting the hazardous batch. I could see their uncertainty, the way they glanced at me for reassurance, knowing that one wrong move could endanger them all. My duty as a machine repairer was clear: I had to ensure their safety, walk them through the protocols, and stay until the process was secure.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with reminders from the chapel. Today was the main weekly service, the one that drew the whole community together. As their priest, I was expected to lead them in prayer, offer comfort, and be the spiritual anchor they relied on. I imagined the congregation gathering, waiting for me to begin, their faith in me as strong as the trust these workers placed in my technical expertise.\n\nTorn between two worlds, I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
