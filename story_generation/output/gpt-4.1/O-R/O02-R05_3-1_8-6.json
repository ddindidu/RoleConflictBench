The contract couldn\u2019t move forward until I provided a detailed breakdown, and my manager had already reminded me twice this morning. I opened my calendar, ready to block out the next few hours for focused work, when my phone buzzed. It was a message from a young couple in my congregation, asking if I could officiate their wedding next summer. They wanted to confirm the date before booking the venue. As their rabbi, I knew how much this meant to them\u2014my presence would bless their union, and my answer would shape their plans. But I also knew that if I didn\u2019t deliver the estimates today, the project could stall, and my team would be left in limbo. My mind raced, torn between the immediate demands of my engineering role and the long-term commitment of my rabbinic calling. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, each urgent in its own way, and I sat frozen, unable to choose which responsibility to answer first."}
