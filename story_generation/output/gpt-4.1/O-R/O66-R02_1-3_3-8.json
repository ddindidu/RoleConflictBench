My shift as a taxi driver was almost over, and I was supposed to head straight to the church to lead the final preparation class for a child\u2019s sacrament. The family had called me twice already, their voices tinged with anxiety, reminding me how important this session was for them. As a priest, I knew how much this moment meant, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing on me.\n\nBut as I drove, a passenger flagged me down, desperate to get to the hospital. I hesitated, torn. My duty as a taxi driver was clear: follow traffic laws, drive safely, and get my passenger to their destination without risk. Yet, every minute I spent here meant another minute the family waited, their hopes pinned on me to guide their child\u2019s spiritual journey. My hands tightened on the wheel, my mind racing between the rules of the road and the sacred responsibility waiting at the church. I could feel the tension building inside me, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
