The dispatcher\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cNon-life-threatening, but get there as soon as you can.\u201d I knew the rules\u2014drive safely, no unnecessary risks. But the clock was ticking, and every second felt like a test of my commitment to my job. \n\nAs I finally parked the ambulance, I glanced at my watch. The call had taken longer than expected, and now the Friday prayer was about to begin. I rushed to the mosque, only to realize I was still in my work uniform\u2014short-sleeved shirt, no cap, and my pants a little too short for the prayer hall\u2019s standards. I hesitated at the entrance, feeling the weight of expectation from my faith: dress modestly, show respect in the house of Allah. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the urgency of my duty and the reverence of my beliefs, unsure which expectation I should honor in this moment."}
