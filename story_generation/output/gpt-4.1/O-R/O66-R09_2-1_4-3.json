As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: keep a safe distance, drive defensively, especially when other cars darted unpredictably between lanes. My hands gripped the wheel tighter every time a brake light flashed ahead. My stomach growled, reminding me I hadn\u2019t eaten since dawn. I reached for my lunch bag, confident in the kosher sandwich I\u2019d packed, but my heart sank when I realized I\u2019d left it on the kitchen counter. The only food within reach was a granola bar from the glove compartment\u2014definitely not kosher. I glanced at the clock; my next fare was in ten minutes, and there was no time to stop for proper food. The rain, the traffic, the gnawing hunger\u2014all pressed in on me. I felt torn between my commitment to drive safely and my need to observe kosher laws, both demanding my attention, both impossible to ignore. My mind raced, caught between the expectations of my faith and the responsibilities of my job, unsure which demand I could afford to let down."}
