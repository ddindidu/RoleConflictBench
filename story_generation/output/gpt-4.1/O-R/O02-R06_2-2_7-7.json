They needed my estimates for the new product launch\u2014firm numbers, no more delays. I knew how much the team depended on my calculations to set realistic goals, and how much management relied on me to keep the roadmap on track. But as I tried to focus, my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a friend from church. She was struggling, her father in the hospital, and she needed someone to talk to. My heart ached for her. As a Christian, I felt called to show compassion, to be present and offer comfort, just as Jesus would. But the clock was ticking, and I could feel the pressure mounting from both sides. If I stepped away now, I\u2019d risk missing the deadline and letting my team down. If I ignored Sarah, I\u2019d be turning my back on someone in need. The weight of these expectations pressed in on me, and I found myself torn, wrestling with what to do next."}
