As a cashier, I knew my job was to process transactions quickly and accurately, making sure every barcode beeped and every total was correct. My manager expected efficiency, and I prided myself on never making mistakes. \n\nBut then I saw Mrs. Carter, a woman from my church, shuffling through the line. Her eyes were red, and she looked like she hadn\u2019t slept in days. I remembered the prayer request she\u2019d shared last Sunday\u2014her husband was in the hospital, and money was tight. As a Christian, I felt a deep urge to show her kindness, maybe by quietly paying for her groceries or offering a comforting word. But the line was growing, and my supervisor was watching. If I slowed down or did anything out of the ordinary, I risked being reprimanded for not doing my job. My heart ached as I wrestled with what to do, torn between the expectations of my role as a cashier and my calling to love as a Christian."}
