The traces are clear\u2014my new functions are the culprit, and the team is counting on me to fix it before the next release. Clean, efficient code is my responsibility, and I know the pressure is on. But as I glance at the clock, I remember the holiday is just days away. My kids are waiting in the living room, their books open, eager to learn the blessings and stories I promised to teach them. I can hear their laughter, and I know how important it is to pass on our traditions, to make sure they feel the warmth and meaning of our heritage. My laptop pings with another urgent message from my manager, but my mind is torn. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my team\u2019s trust in my technical skills, and my children\u2019s need for guidance and connection. I sit at my desk, caught between the demands of code and culture, unsure which role to answer first."}
