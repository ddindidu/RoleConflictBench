My sales manager\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe need three more sign-ups, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d My fingers hovered over the phone, the script open in front of me. I knew which leads were most likely to say yes\u2014elderly folks who\u2019d picked up before, confused but polite. The pressure was suffocating. I thought of the Bible verse I\u2019d read that morning: \u201cDo to others as you would have them do to you.\u201d My Christian faith told me to be honest, to treat people with respect, not to manipulate or pressure. But the numbers on the screen, the threat of letting my team down, the fear of missing rent\u2014they all screamed at me to push harder, to gloss over the fine print, to close the deal no matter what. My hand trembled as I dialed the next number, my heart pounding with the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
