My research notes were scattered, and I knew I should update the logs with today\u2019s findings. The data was fresh in my mind, and accuracy mattered\u2014my integrity as a scientist depended on it. Still, the logs could wait until tomorrow; the schedule was flexible, and no one would notice a slight delay.\n\nJust as I reached for my pen, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was in tears, her family in crisis, and she needed someone to talk to\u2014someone to listen and offer hope. As her pastor, I was expected to be present, to provide comfort and guidance, especially in moments like this.\n\nI stared at the blinking cursor on my computer, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The responsibility to document my research accurately tugged at me, while the call to support Sarah pulled just as hard. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the demands of science and faith, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both my full attention at the same time."}
