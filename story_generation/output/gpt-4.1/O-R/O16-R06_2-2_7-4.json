As a doctor, I know my patient, Mrs. Lee, depends on me to monitor her autoimmune disease closely. Her treatment is complex, requiring regular adjustments and careful observation. This week, her symptoms have worsened, and she\u2019s scheduled for a critical infusion that only I am qualified to administer. The hospital expects me to be there, and I know missing this appointment could jeopardize her health.\n\nBut as a Christian, Sunday is sacred. My church community expects me to be present, to worship, to serve, and to find spiritual renewal. I haven\u2019t missed a service in months, and I know my absence will be noticed. I feel the weight of my faith\u2019s call to honor the Sabbath and support my fellow believers.\n\nAs I sit at my kitchen table, medical charts on one side and my Bible on the other, I feel torn. Both roles demand my presence, both are deeply important to me, and I can\u2019t see a way to fulfill both expectations at once. My heart aches as I wrestle with the decision, knowing that whatever I choose, something valuable will be left behind."}
