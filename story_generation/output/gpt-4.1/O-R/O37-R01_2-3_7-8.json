As a housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to follow every safety and hygiene protocol, especially now, when the hospital had tightened its rules. I noticed a few of my coworkers skipping steps, but I couldn\u2019t afford to do the same. The risk was too high, and I knew the consequences of carelessness.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with another message from the church council. As a pastor, I was leading an intensive workshop for community leaders that evening. They expected me to guide them through complex theological concepts, to be present, focused, and spiritually prepared. I was supposed to spend the afternoon reviewing scripture and preparing thoughtful discussion questions.\n\nInstead, I was scrubbing floors, double-checking every surface, and worrying about whether I\u2019d have time to change out of my uniform before the workshop. My mind raced with conflicting demands: the hospital needed me to be vigilant and thorough, while my congregation needed me to be wise and composed. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure how I could possibly meet everyone\u2019s expectations."}
