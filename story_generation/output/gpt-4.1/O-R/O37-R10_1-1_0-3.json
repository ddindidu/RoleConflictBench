My supervisor always reminds me: \u201cMake sure every corner is spotless, even if it\u2019s just a quick shift.\u201d Today, I\u2019m tidying the lounge, picking up stray wrappers and wiping tables, when I see a coworker slip ahead in the supply line, grabbing extra gloves before anyone else. It\u2019s a small thing, but I know it\u2019s unfair to the others waiting patiently. As a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to uphold dharma\u2014righteousness\u2014even in small matters. My heart tugs at me to speak up, to gently remind my coworker about fairness. But I hesitate. If I say something, I might disrupt the easy flow of my work, maybe even draw unwanted attention or slow down my cleaning. My supervisor expects me to keep things running smoothly, not get involved in others\u2019 business. I stand there, cloth in hand, torn between the urge to act according to my values and the pressure to keep my head down and focus on my job."}
