The nurse\u2019s voice trembled\u2014\u201cThe ventilator\u2019s failing. We need you.\u201d My mind snapped into repair mode, scanning the fault codes, fingers itching to pry open the panel and get to work. Every second mattered; a life hung in the balance. But as I knelt by the machine, I saw the patient\u2019s wife, crumpled in a chair, sobbing quietly. No one was with her. I remembered my faith, the call to comfort the brokenhearted, to be present in suffering. My heart ached to kneel beside her, to offer a prayer or a gentle word. Yet the machine\u2019s beeping grew more urgent, demanding my full attention. I felt torn in two\u2014my hands needed to save a life, but my spirit longed to show compassion. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the urgent call of my profession and the quiet command of my faith."}
