The house was barely holding together, and Mrs. Johnson\u2019s anxious eyes followed my every move. \u201cWe need a plan today,\u201d she pleaded, \u201cbefore the next storm.\u201d As a carpenter, I knew the urgency\u2014one more heavy rain and the roof could collapse. I promised her I\u2019d draw up a repair plan by evening.\n\nBut as I stepped outside, my phone buzzed. It was the church deacon. A family in our congregation had just lost everything in a fire. They needed me\u2014Pastor Mark\u2014to gather the community, offer comfort, and organize immediate support. My heart twisted.

Yet, the Johnsons\u2019 safety depended on my skills as a carpenter, and they were counting on me just as much.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both hammers and prayers pressing down on me. I stood on the porch, caught between two worlds, each demanding all of me, and I didn\u2019t know which way to turn."}
