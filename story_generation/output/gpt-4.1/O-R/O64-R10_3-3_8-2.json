My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cStay friendly, no matter what.\u201d I force a smile as a woman slams her groceries on the counter, her voice sharp with frustration about the wait. I nod, apologizing, trying to keep my tone gentle, even as my heart pounds. But my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder for my midday prayer. I glance at the clock. If I don\u2019t step away now, I\u2019ll miss the window for my daily ritual, something my faith tells me is non-negotiable. My mind races: the expectation to serve each customer with patience, to be the calm in their chaos, clashes with the sacred duty to honor my spiritual practice. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, my hands trembling as I scan another item, torn between the demands of my job and the devotion that shapes my identity."}
