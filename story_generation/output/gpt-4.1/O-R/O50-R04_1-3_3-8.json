The shutdown was carefully planned, and my supervisor had emphasized how crucial it was to clean and service every machine thoroughly. Any delay or oversight could mean costly breakdowns later. I was mentally preparing for the long hours ahead when my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque: someone had arrived, desperate for guidance after a sudden loss. As the imam, I knew the community expected me to be present, to listen, and to offer comfort in moments like these. My heart ached for the person in need, but I also felt the weight of responsibility for the machines and the trust my team placed in me. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each urgent in its own way. I stood there, torn, feeling the tension build inside as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
