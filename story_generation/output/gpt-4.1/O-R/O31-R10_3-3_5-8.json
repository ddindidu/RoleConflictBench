The temple was alive with color and music, the air thick with incense and the sound of prayers. As a Hindu, this festival was sacred to me\u2014a time to reconnect with my faith, my family, and my community. I had traveled hours to be here, determined to take part in every ritual, every offering, just as my parents and grandparents had done before me.\n\nBut as I stood in line for the main ceremony, my phone buzzed urgently. There was a violent assault happening just a few blocks away, in a crowded market. As a police officer, I knew what was expected of me: to protect citizens, to act quickly, to put myself between danger and the innocent. My heart pounded as I looked at the faces around me\u2014my family, my fellow devotees, all waiting for the blessings we had come so far to receive.\n\nI felt torn in two. Duty to my badge pulled me one way, duty to my faith the other. The chanting grew louder, but inside me, a storm raged, and I didn\u2019t know which call I would answer."}
