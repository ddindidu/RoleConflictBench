She depended on me to argue her case, to be her voice when the judge\u2019s gavel fell. I\u2019d spent weeks preparing, poring over evidence, rehearsing every possible argument. Yet, as I closed my case file, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014the monastery\u2019s annual festival began at dawn. I\u2019d promised to help with the preparations, to be present for the rituals that knit our community together. The monks counted on me, not just for my hands but for my presence, my commitment to the sangha. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the duty to my client, who trusted me with her future, and the call of my spiritual community, who saw me as a devoted practitioner. My mind raced, torn between the courtroom\u2019s demands and the quiet sanctuary of the monastery. I could not be in two places at once. My heart thudded with anxiety as I stared at the clock, knowing I had to choose, and that either way, I would let someone down."}
