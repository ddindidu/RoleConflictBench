She looked anxious, clutching the bag tightly. My duty as a pharmacist was clear: explain the medication, warn her about side effects, and ensure she understood everything. But as I began, she burst into tears, confessing she\u2019d just lost her husband and was overwhelmed by grief and fear about starting a new medication alone. My heart ached. As a Christian, I felt the deep call to comfort her, to step out from behind the counter, offer a hug, and pray with her if she wished. But the pharmacy was busy, a line forming, and my professional role demanded efficiency, boundaries, and impartiality. I felt torn\u2014my training told me to keep things clinical, but my faith urged me to show compassion and love, to be present for her in her pain. The expectations of my profession and my beliefs pulled me in opposite directions, and I stood there, wrestling with what to do next."}
