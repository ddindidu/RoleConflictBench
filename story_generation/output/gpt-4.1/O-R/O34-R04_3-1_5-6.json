Suddenly, a pilot\u2019s voice crackled through: \u201cMayday, mayday, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My heart pounded. Every second counted. I relayed instructions, my voice steady, but my mind raced with calculations and contingency plans. Just then, my phone buzzed on the desk. It was Ahmed, a gentle soul from the mosque, texting, \u201cSheikh, if you have a moment, I could really use your advice.\u201d I remembered his troubled eyes after last Friday\u2019s prayer, the unspoken weight he carried. As an imam, I was expected to be present, to listen, to guide. But right now, as an air traffic controller, lives depended on my undivided attention. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each urgent in its own way. My hands hovered over the controls, torn between the sky and the soul, feeling the impossible pull of duty from both earth and heaven."}
