My client\u2019s future depended on my presence in court; the judge had made it clear\u2014no delays, no excuses. Yet, as I glanced at the small wooden cross on my shelf, my heart tightened. Mother Superior had just informed me that I was chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the city\u2019s cathedral, a rare honor for our convent. The vigil coincided with the trial\u2019s opening day. My sisters expected me to guide them in prayer, to be a symbol of faith and devotion. My client expected me to fight for justice, to be unwavering in the courtroom. I felt torn, pulled by the sacred vows I had taken and the oath I had sworn as a lawyer. The expectations from both worlds clashed within me, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to yield. I closed my eyes, feeling the storm of responsibility and guilt swirl inside, knowing that whatever I chose, a part of me would be left behind."}
