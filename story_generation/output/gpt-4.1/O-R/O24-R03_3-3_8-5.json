Suddenly, my clerk slipped me a note\u2014urgent, trembling. The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was explaining. My mind raced. As a judge, I was expected to be the embodiment of legal precision, always current, always correct. I had to stop, reassess, and ensure justice was served according to the new law. But my phone vibrated in my pocket\u2014a reminder. Tonight, I was to lead the prayer vigil, representing my convent at the cathedral. The sisters had entrusted me, believing I would guide them in faith and unity. The event was about to begin, and I was expected to be there, robed and ready, a symbol of devotion. My heart pounded. The courtroom\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for direction. The convent\u2019s hopes rested on my presence. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my undivided self, and I stood frozen, torn between the law and the call to prayer."}
