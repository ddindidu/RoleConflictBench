The school zone sign flashed, and I instinctively eased off the gas, eyes scanning for children. Suddenly, orange cones forced all cars into a single lane, and the line of vehicles crawled forward. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the daily prayer service at the chapel was about to begin. As a priest, I knew the congregation expected me to lead, even if today\u2019s service was optional. But as a driver, I couldn\u2019t risk the safety of the children or break the law by speeding or weaving through the detour. My hands tightened on the wheel. The weight of my collar pressed against my neck, a silent reminder of my duty to the community. Yet, the children\u2019s laughter on the sidewalk tugged at my conscience as a driver. I felt torn, the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, and I wondered which responsibility I should honor first."}
