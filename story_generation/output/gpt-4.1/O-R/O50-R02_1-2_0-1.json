It had sputtered to a halt again, just as I thought I\u2019d finally coaxed it back to life. The supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime, even now. Find the problem, fix it for good.\u201d I knew how much they depended on me, especially during these slow weeks when every working machine mattered. But as I wiped the grease from my hands, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the main weekly service at the chapel. The congregation would be gathering soon, waiting for me to lead them in prayer, to offer comfort and guidance. I could almost hear the choir warming up, the expectant hush before the first hymn. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds: the urgent need to restore the machine, the sacred duty to my community. I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, torn between the clang of metal and the call of faith, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
