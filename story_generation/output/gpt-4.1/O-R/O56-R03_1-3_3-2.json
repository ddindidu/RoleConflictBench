I nodded, but my mind was elsewhere\u2014my phone had buzzed twice already with urgent messages from the convent. The hurricane had devastated the town, and the mayor was pleading for help. As a nun, I was expected to drop everything, to lead the relief effort, to be a beacon of hope for those who\u2019d lost everything. But here, scissors in hand, I was also a hairdresser, responsible for my clients\u2019 comfort and satisfaction. Mrs. Lee deserved my full attention, her small request a reminder of the normalcy people craved. My heart pounded as I weighed the needs of my community against the promise I\u2019d made to each person in my chair. The clock ticked, and I felt the pressure mounting, torn between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
