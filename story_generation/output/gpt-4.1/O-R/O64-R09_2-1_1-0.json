My manager expects me to keep things moving, to scan each item quickly and accurately, no mistakes. I glance at the clock\u2014almost time for my weekly study session with the kids at the synagogue. I promised them we\u2019d talk about the story of Ruth today, and I know how much they look forward to these lessons. My phone buzzes in my pocket, a reminder I set so I wouldn\u2019t forget. I\u2019m torn. If I leave now, I\u2019ll let down my coworkers and the customers who are already frustrated. If I stay, I\u2019ll disappoint the children and break my commitment to teaching them about our traditions. My hands move automatically over the register, but my mind is split, wrestling with the weight of both responsibilities pressing in from either side."}
