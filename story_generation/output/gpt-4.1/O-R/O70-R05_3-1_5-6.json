The package was marked \u201cconfidential\u201d and \u201chigh value\u201d\u2014the kind of delivery that required a signature and a photo ID. As I rang the bell, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced at the screen: an email from a young couple, asking if I could officiate their wedding next summer. They wanted to meet soon, to talk about their hopes and dreams, and to see if I was the right rabbi for them.\n\nThe door opened, and a woman greeted me, her ID already in hand. I forced a smile, but my mind was racing. My delivery supervisor expected me to be quick, efficient, and thorough\u2014no mistakes, no delays.
