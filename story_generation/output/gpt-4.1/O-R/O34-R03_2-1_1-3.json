The holiday rush has turned the airspace into a puzzle of moving pieces, and every instruction I give must be precise. My headset crackles with pilots\u2019 voices, tense but trusting. I know the expectation: keep the skies safe, manage the congestion, and prevent delays from spiraling into chaos.\n\nBut as the clock ticks closer to seven, the convent bell tolls, echoing through the control room\u2019s window. It\u2019s time for morning prayer, the sacred moment when all sisters gather in the chapel, voices rising in unity. My heart aches with the pull of devotion\u2014I am expected to be there, kneeling in the pew, present in body and spirit. The Mother Superior\u2019s gentle reminder from last night rings in my mind: \u201cWe must not let worldly duties eclipse our time with God.\u201d\n\nI glance at the screen, then at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The demands of the sky and the call to prayer tug at me, and I sit frozen, torn between duty and devotion, unable to move."}
