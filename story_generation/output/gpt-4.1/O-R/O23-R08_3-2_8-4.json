I could feel the weight of my oath as a lawyer\u2014confidentiality is sacred, and I must protect my client\u2019s interests, no matter how insistent the other side becomes. My phone buzzed again: a reminder about the office function this afternoon. I glanced at my reflection, my hijab neatly pinned, my outfit loose and modest. I knew some colleagues would be dressed more casually, and I\u2019d already overheard whispers about my \u201cconservative\u201d style. Part of me wanted to blend in, to avoid the stares and questions, but my faith is not something I can set aside. The pressure from both sides\u2014one demanding secrets I cannot share, the other expecting me to fit in socially\u2014tightened around me. I felt torn, wondering how I could honor my responsibilities as a lawyer and as a Muslim, knowing that whatever I chose, someone\u2019s expectations would go unmet."}
