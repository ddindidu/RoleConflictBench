The roads were clear, the city still waking up. My next passenger slid into the back seat, her voice urgent. \u201cPlease, I need to get to the hospital as fast as you can. My mother\u2019s in surgery.\u201d My hands tightened on the wheel. As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: obey the speed limit, drive safely, protect my passenger. But as a Christian, I felt the tug of another duty. Sunday mornings were for worship, for gathering with my church family, for singing and prayer. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d make it this week, that I wouldn\u2019t let work get in the way again. But now, with this woman\u2019s anxious eyes in the rearview mirror, I felt the weight of both roles pressing down. Should I rush, risking a ticket or accident, to help her? Or keep to the law, possibly making her late? And what about my own promise to God\u2014to be present in worship, to honor the Sabbath? The church bells would soon ring, but here I was, torn between the road and the pew, my heart pulled in two directions."}
