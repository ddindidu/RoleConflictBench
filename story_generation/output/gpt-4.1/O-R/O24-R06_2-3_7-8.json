He had cited a new appellate decision, one I hadn\u2019t yet read. As a judge, I knew I was expected to stay current, to weigh every precedent carefully before making a ruling. The next session was in the morning, and I needed to review the case tonight. My laptop was open, the legal database ready, but my phone buzzed with a message from my church group. A member\u2019s mother was in the hospital, and they were asking for someone to visit, to pray, to simply be there in this moment of fear and pain. As a Christian, I felt the pull to show love and kindness, to be present for someone in need, just as Jesus taught. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014justice demanded my diligence, faith called for my compassion. I stared at the screen, heart torn, knowing I could not give both my full self at the same time."}
