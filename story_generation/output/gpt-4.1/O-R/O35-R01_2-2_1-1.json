A minor delay up ahead meant I had to adjust our speed, keeping the ride smooth and safe while still trying to make up lost time. The passengers depended on me to get them to their destinations without a hitch. My mind was focused, calculating every move, when my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was waiting at the next station, desperate for guidance about a life-changing decision. As her pastor, I knew she needed me to listen, to offer comfort and wisdom. But as the operator, I couldn\u2019t leave my post or let my attention waver. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding unwavering focus for everyone\u2019s safety, the other calling for compassion and presence. My heart pounded as the train neared the station, torn between the tracks and the trust placed in me from two very different worlds."}
