My heart skips. The Supreme Court has just overturned the very precedent I am referencing. I must halt, reconsider, and perhaps even recall the jury. The courtroom is tense, all eyes on me, waiting for clarity. My mind races with the responsibility to uphold the law, to ensure justice is not only done but seen to be done, and to stay current with every shift in legal doctrine.\n\nYet, tonight is the annual memorial service at the temple. As a Buddhist, I am expected to be present, to chant, to offer incense, to support grieving families. The community looks to me for spiritual steadiness, for compassion and presence. I feel the weight of their expectations, the comfort my participation brings.\n\nCaught between the urgent demands of the law and the quiet call of my spiritual community, I feel my chest tighten. Both roles require my full presence, both are urgent, both are sacred. I close my eyes for a moment, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
