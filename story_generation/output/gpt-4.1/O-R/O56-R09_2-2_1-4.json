Her eyes darted around, searching for reassurance. I smiled, setting the broom aside, and walked over to greet her, remembering how important it is to make every client feel welcome, especially someone new and nervous. \u201cHi, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here,\u201d I said, hoping my warmth would put her at ease. But as I led her to the chair, my stomach rumbled\u2014a sharp reminder that I hadn\u2019t eaten since morning. I glanced at the clock. My break was coming up, but I knew the only kosher vendor nearby would close soon. If I didn\u2019t go now, I\u2019d miss my chance for a proper meal, but leaving this anxious client alone felt wrong. My mind raced between my commitment to my faith and my responsibility to my client, the weight of both expectations pressing in on me as I tried to steady my hands and my thoughts."}
