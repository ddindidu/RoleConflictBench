I wore my comfortable, modest clothes\u2014loose pants, a long-sleeved shirt, and my hijab\u2014ready for a quiet day indoors. Just as I settled in, my phone buzzed. A regular customer was desperate: her flight was in two hours, and the roads were already slick with snow. She begged me to drive her to the airport, promising a generous tip. \n\nAs a taxi driver, I knew I was expected to get her there safely and on time, no matter the weather. But my clothes, perfect for home, weren\u2019t warm enough for a long drive in a freezing car, and I didn\u2019t want to compromise my modesty by changing into something less appropriate just for comfort. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my duty to my passenger clashing with my commitment to my faith. My hands trembled as I stared at my closet, torn between the demands of my job and the expectations of my beliefs, unsure which path to take."}
