They seemed nervous, asking for simple tips, and I could hear the relief in their voice as I explained each step. My job is to make sure clients feel confident and supported, so I stayed on the line, answering every question. Meanwhile, I was at a communal event, surrounded by colleagues and friends, and the aroma of the catered lunch filled the room. Plates were being passed around, but none of the dishes had kosher certification. I could feel eyes on me, expecting me to join in, to be part of the group. My stomach tightened\u2014not just from hunger, but from the pressure. I wanted to be helpful to my client, but I also needed to find a way to observe my dietary laws without drawing attention or seeming ungrateful. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt caught between the need to guide my client and the need to honor my faith, unsure how to move forward."}
