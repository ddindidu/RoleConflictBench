My supervisor handed me a plate, reminding me to eat before my next cleaning round. I glanced at the spread\u2014none of it had kosher certification, and I couldn\u2019t be sure how it was prepared. My stomach rumbled, but I hesitated. As a housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to keep up my energy and follow all safety protocols, especially now with the extra shifts. Skipping meals could make me lightheaded, and I needed to be alert, careful with chemicals and equipment. But as a Jew, I was raised to observe kosher laws, to be mindful of what I eat, even when it\u2019s hard. The expectation to respect my faith pressed against the practical need to do my job well. I felt the weight of both roles, the demands of my work and my beliefs pulling me in opposite directions, and I stood there, plate in hand, unsure what to do next."}
