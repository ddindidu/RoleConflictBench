The new feature is almost done, but the code review pings keep coming\u2014warnings about performance, suggestions for cleaner logic. My team expects me to deliver code that\u2019s not just functional, but elegant and efficient. I know if I leave it as is, I\u2019ll be letting them down, risking bugs and technical debt. Yet, my phone vibrates with a gentle reminder: tonight is the memorial service at the temple. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to be present, to help set up, to chant with the community and honor those who have passed. The thought of missing it fills me with guilt; these rituals are not just tradition, but a way to support others and deepen my own practice. My mind tugs in two directions\u2014toward the glowing monitor and the quiet sanctuary. I feel the tension coil in my chest, the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each with its own kind of consequence."}
