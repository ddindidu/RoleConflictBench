My heart felt light as I opened the mushaf, ready to immerse myself in its verses. Just then, my phone buzzed urgently. The hospital\u2019s maintenance supervisor was on the line: a life-support device in the ICU was flashing critical fault codes, and I was the only technician on call. My mind raced. The expectation was clear\u2014lives could depend on my ability to diagnose and fix the machine, and I knew the hospital trusted me to respond without hesitation. Yet, the peace I found in my evening recitation was something I cherished deeply, a spiritual anchor I rarely had time for. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the duty to my profession, where every second could mean the difference between life and death, and the duty to my faith, to nourish my soul and keep my connection with Allah strong. I sat there, torn, the Quran open in my lap and my phone still vibrating in my hand, caught between two worlds that both demanded all of me."}
