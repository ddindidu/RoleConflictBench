Mrs. Alvarez sat across from me, her eyes searching mine for reassurance as she asked about her recent blood test results. I could see the worry in her face, and I knew she needed me to explain things gently, to answer her questions with patience and care. But as I opened my mouth to speak, the distant chime of the chapel bell echoed through the hallway\u2014a gentle but insistent reminder that morning prayers were about to begin. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to join my sisters in devotion and uphold the rhythm of our spiritual life. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to my patient, who needed my full attention and compassion, and the call to prayer, where my absence would be noticed and perhaps even questioned. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, my mind racing as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
