My white coat felt heavy with the responsibility of being her doctor\u2014someone she trusted to guide her with honesty and care. Just as I was about to reassure her about her test results, I noticed through the glass partition that another patient, Mr. Patel, had quietly slipped ahead in the waiting line. It was subtle, but I saw the nurse hesitate, unsure whether to say anything.\n\nA wave of discomfort washed over me. As a Hindu, I was raised to value dharma\u2014doing what is right, even in small matters. My conscience nudged me to address the unfairness, to gently remind Mr. Patel about the importance of waiting his turn. But as a doctor, my priority was to focus on Mrs. Sharma, to give her my full attention and not let outside distractions affect our conversation. My mind raced, torn between upholding my ethical beliefs and fulfilling my professional duty to my patient. I felt the tension coil inside me, unsure which role should guide my next words and actions."}
