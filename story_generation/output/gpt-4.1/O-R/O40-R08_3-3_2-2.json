Tomorrow, we\u2019d start the structural work on the new house, and I knew the safety protocols by heart: every tool must be checked, every blade sharpened, every cord untangled. My crew depended on me to make sure nothing was overlooked. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. Tonight was the community Quran study circle, and I hadn\u2019t read the assigned verses. I could already imagine the gentle disappointment in my imam\u2019s eyes, the expectation that I would come prepared, ready to reflect and share. My mind raced between the responsibility to my team\u2019s safety and my commitment to my faith. The tools lay before me, waiting for inspection, while my Quran sat unopened in my bag. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my time, each unwilling to wait."}
