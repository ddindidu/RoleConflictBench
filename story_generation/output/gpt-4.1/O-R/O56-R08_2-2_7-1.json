My next client, Sarah, had just come in after her gym session, her hair sticking to her forehead, a little greasy from sweat. She smiled apologetically, and I reassured her, ushering her to the sink. As I massaged conditioner into her scalp, my mind wandered to the Quran resting in my bag in the break room. Ramadan was halfway through, and I was already behind on my daily reading. The guilt pressed on me\u2014my faith asked for reflection and recitation, especially now, but my job demanded my full attention, my hands, my time. I could hear the gentle hum of dryers and the chatter of clients, but inside, I was wrestling with the weight of both worlds. Should I take a longer break to catch up on my reading, risking falling behind with clients? Or should I focus on my work, knowing I\u2019d be even further behind in my spiritual duties? The expectations pulled at me from both sides, and I felt suspended, unable to move in either direction."}
