My boots are caked with yesterday\u2019s dust, and my hard hat feels heavy as I hurry toward the gathering crew. The foreman\u2019s voice crackles over the radio, reminding us that the safety briefing starts in two minutes\u2014attendance is non-negotiable, and missing it means risking my job and letting down the team. But my phone vibrates in my pocket, and I see a message from Sister Agnes: a parishioner is waiting in the chapel, desperate to talk, her faith shaken and her heart in turmoil. As a nun, I am called to listen, to offer comfort and guidance, especially in moments like this. My hands tremble, torn between the duty to my coworkers and the sacred responsibility to my parish. The weight of my helmet presses down, but so does the silent expectation of my habit. I stand at the edge of the site, the chapel just across the street, my heart pounding as I wrestle with which path to take."}
