My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need results, not excuses.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing the pitch, but my thoughts drifted to the community gathering I\u2019d attended earlier as a pastor. I\u2019d shared the parable of the Good Samaritan, urging everyone to act with compassion and honesty. Now, as a telemarketer, I was expected to push products, sometimes glossing over details to close a deal. My finger hovered over the call button. Could I really use persuasive tactics that bordered on manipulation, right after preaching about integrity? The pressure to meet my quota pressed down on me, but so did the weight of my own words about living truthfully. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the demands of my job and the principles I\u2019d just taught."}
