The court hearing for my client was set for tomorrow morning\u2014a minor procedural matter, one that could be postponed with a simple call. Yet, I knew my client was anxious, counting on my presence to reassure them that their case mattered. At the same time, I had promised Miriam, my conversion student, that I would guide her through her final study session before her Beit Din. She was nervous, desperate for reassurance and clarity, and this session was the culmination of months of study and soul-searching. \n\nAs a lawyer, I felt the weight of my client\u2019s trust, the professional duty to be present, to advocate, to never let a client feel abandoned. As a rabbi, I felt the sacred responsibility to guide a soul on the threshold of joining our people, to honor her journey and the sanctity of this moment. Both roles demanded my presence, my attention, my care. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me, knowing that no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down. I sat at my desk, phone in hand, unable to dial, caught between two worlds that both needed me."}
