The workshop for community leaders was starting in less than an hour, and I was supposed to lead the opening session. My mind raced with the theological notes I\u2019d prepared, but I forced myself to focus on the woman in my chair. She peered into the mirror, her lips pressed tight, and I could see the disappointment in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit\u2026 warmer than I expected,\u201d she said quietly. As a hairdresser, I knew I needed to address her concern, reassure her, maybe even redo the colour if she wanted. But as a pastor, I felt the weight of my responsibility to the workshop\u2014people were counting on me to guide them through difficult spiritual questions, to be present and prepared. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the urge to stay and fix things for my client with the knowledge that my absence at the church would let down a roomful of eager leaders. I stood there, caught between two worlds, feeling the pressure of both expectations closing in."}
