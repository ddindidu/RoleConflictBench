The project team had just started exploring ideas for a new system, and my manager expected me to brainstorm technical solutions before our Monday meeting. I knew I could propose alternatives later, but the pressure to impress my colleagues and show initiative gnawed at me. \n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: church service in an hour. I\u2019d missed last week, and the pastor had gently reminded me how important it was to worship together and support our community. I felt a pang of guilt\u2014my faith taught me to honor God and be present for others, not just when it was convenient. \n\nMy mind raced, torn between the urge to keep working and the call to join my church family. I stared at the clock, heart pounding, wrestling with the weight of both expectations pressing in from either side."}
