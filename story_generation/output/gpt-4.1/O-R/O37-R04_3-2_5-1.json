She always expected me to keep track of supplies, and I knew she\u2019d be upset if the table wasn\u2019t done today. I checked the time\u2014just thirty minutes until Asr prayer at the mosque. Normally, I could rely on Brother Yusuf to lead if I was late, but he\u2019d called in sick this morning. The congregation would be waiting, expecting me to guide them in prayer, especially since I was the only imam available. My phone buzzed with a reminder from the mosque committee, and I could almost hear Mrs. Rahman\u2019s disappointment if I left her table unfinished. My mind raced, torn between my duty to the community and my responsibility to my client. Both roles demanded my presence, both were counting on me, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in from all sides."}
