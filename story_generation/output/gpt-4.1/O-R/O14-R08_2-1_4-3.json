The departmental meeting was in two hours, and I still needed to prepare a summary of my preliminary findings. As a scientist, I knew the importance of accuracy and professionalism\u2014my colleagues expected a clear, honest report, and I wanted to meet that standard. But today was different. I had planned to spend the day at home with my family, relaxing in comfortable, casual clothes. As a Muslim, I always dressed modestly in public, but at home, I felt free to wear what I liked around my immediate family.\n\nNow, with the meeting moved to a video call, I felt a knot in my stomach. Should I quickly change into more modest attire, even though I was at home, just in case my camera turned on? Or should I stay as I was, prioritizing comfort and the privacy of my own space? The expectations of my faith and my profession seemed to clash in this small but significant moment. I stared at my reflection in the screen, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation to meet."}
