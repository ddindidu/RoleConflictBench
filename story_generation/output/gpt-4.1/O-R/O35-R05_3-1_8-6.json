My hands grip the controls, mind racing through the checklist\u2014speed, announcements, door timing. I know the transit authority expects nothing less than perfection, especially now. My phone, set to vibrate, buzzes in my pocket. I glance down during a red light: a message from a young couple, hopeful, asking if I can officiate their wedding next spring. As a rabbi, I know how much this means to them\u2014how important it is to respond with warmth and certainty, to be present for these milestones. But the supervisor\u2019s gaze is heavy, and I can\u2019t risk a misstep or distraction. My heart pounds with the weight of both roles: the duty to my passengers and the sacred trust of my congregation. I feel the tension coil inside me, torn between the immediate demands of the subway and the long-term commitments of my calling."}
