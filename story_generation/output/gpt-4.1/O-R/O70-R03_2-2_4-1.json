The address matched the small house across the street, where smoke stains still marked the walls from last night\u2019s fire. As a delivery person, I was expected to secure the package and get a signature\u2014no exceptions, especially for items of value. But as a nun, my heart ached for the family inside, who had lost so much and now needed food and clothing more than ever. I could see the mother through the window, comforting her children, and I knew the sisters were already gathering supplies for them. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cConfirm delivery with signature.\u201d Yet, Sister Maria called from the kitchen, \u201cWe need your help with the donations!\u201d I felt torn, the weight of the package heavy in my arms, my conscience pulled in two directions. Should I fulfill my duty as a delivery person, or rush to serve the family in need as a nun? The expectations pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the demands of my two worlds."}
