My stomach rumbled, reminding me I hadn\u2019t eaten since dawn. As a telemarketer, every minute was tracked\u2014if I left my desk early, the compliance system would flag me, and I\u2019d have to explain myself to my supervisor. But as a Jew, I needed to eat kosher, and the only vendor I trusted was a ten-minute walk away. If I waited for my break, I\u2019d barely have time to get there and back, let alone eat. If I left now, I\u2019d risk disciplinary action. My headset felt heavier as I weighed the expectations: the company\u2019s demand for strict adherence to schedule, and my own commitment to keeping kosher. My heart pounded as I stared at the time, torn between the rules of my job and the rules of my faith, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy both."}
