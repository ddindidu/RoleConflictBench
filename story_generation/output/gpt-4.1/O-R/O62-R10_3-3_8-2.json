I glanced at my watch\u2014time for my evening prayers. As a Hindu, I never missed my daily rituals; the chanting, the offerings, the peace it brought me. I had set up a small altar in the staff room, and my incense sticks were ready. But as I prepared to leave my post for a few minutes, I caught sight of a child in the deep end, flailing, clearly out of their depth. The rules were strict: no one was allowed in that section without supervision, and as a lifeguard, it was my duty to enforce them and ensure everyone\u2019s safety. My heart pounded. If I left now, I\u2019d break my sacred routine. If I stayed, I\u2019d neglect my spiritual commitment. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I stood frozen, torn between the call of my faith and the call of my duty."}
