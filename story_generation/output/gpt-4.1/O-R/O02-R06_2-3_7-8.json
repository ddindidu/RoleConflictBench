Management had been clear: they needed my time estimates by noon for the quarterly roadmap. I knew how much the team depended on my accuracy\u2014if I underestimated, we\u2019d be drowning in overtime; if I overestimated, we\u2019d lose credibility. My phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a colleague who\u2019d just lost her father. She was in the break room, struggling, and I could hear her muffled sobs from down the hall. As a Christian, I felt a deep pull to go to her, to offer comfort and kindness, to be present in her pain as Jesus would have been. But the clock was ticking, and I could almost feel the weight of management\u2019s expectations pressing on my shoulders. I stared at the screen, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the call to show love when it mattered most. My heart ached with the tension, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left undone."}
