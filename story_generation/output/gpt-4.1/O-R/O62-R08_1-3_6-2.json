My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo one in the shallow end without a lifeguard present.\u201d Yet, every so often, a few swimmers slipped in, laughing, ignoring the rules. I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014one accident, and it would be on me. But tonight was also the community Quran study circle, and I hadn\u2019t finished reading the verses we\u2019d discuss. My heart ached with guilt; I was expected to come prepared, to reflect deeply, to honor my faith and my friends. The clock ticked closer to the study circle\u2019s start. Should I leave the pool a little early, risking unsupervised swimmers, or stay and miss the chance to connect with my faith and community? The demands pressed in from both sides, and I stood at the water\u2019s edge, torn, the whistle cold in my hand and the Quran\u2019s words heavy on my mind."}
