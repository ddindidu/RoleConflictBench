My responses came easily; I\u2019d done this a hundred times, and the customer seemed satisfied, just needing a little reassurance. Suddenly, my phone buzzed with a message from the church secretary: someone had arrived at the chapel, desperate and in tears, asking for me by name. My heart clenched. As a priest, I knew the weight of such moments\u2014someone in crisis, seeking comfort and guidance, expecting me to be present, compassionate, and wise. But here I was, tethered to my desk, expected to finish the call, handle objections, and meet my sales quota. My mind raced, torn between the calm professionalism required by my telemarketing role and the urgent, sacred duty of my priesthood. The customer\u2019s voice faded into the background as I wrestled with the impossible choice, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in on me."}
