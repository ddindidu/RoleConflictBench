The address was across town, and traffic was already thickening. As a delivery person, I knew the company expected me to secure every package, especially one like this, and confirm the recipient\u2019s identity without fail. But as a priest, I was supposed to be at the church in fifteen minutes, ready to guide the team through the first planning session for the new season\u2019s faith formation. I could already imagine the disappointed faces of the volunteers if I was late, the subtle message that their time and our mission weren\u2019t my priority. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, heart pounding as I weighed the trust placed in me by both my employer and my parishioners.
