My client\u2019s future depended on my performance; the motion was critical, and I needed to be sharp, focused, and ready. As I worked late into the evening, hunger gnawed at me. I opened the office pantry, relieved to see the familiar kosher labels on the snacks I\u2019d brought from home. But then, a colleague knocked, inviting me to join the team for a late dinner at a nearby restaurant\u2014an unspoken expectation of camaraderie and strategy before big court days. I knew the place well; nothing on the menu was kosher. My colleagues expected me to join, to bond, to show commitment to the team and the client. But my faith demanded I keep kosher, even if it meant standing apart. I felt the tension rise inside me, torn between my professional duty to my client and my personal commitment to my faith. The weight of both expectations pressed on me as I stood in the doorway, uncertain which path to take."}
