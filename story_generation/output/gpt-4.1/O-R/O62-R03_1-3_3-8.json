As a lifeguard, I was expected to keep everything in order, so I scanned the deck. A few pool chairs were out of line, not dangerous, but not perfect either. I knew the director would expect me to fix them before the swimmers arrived. But as I reached for the first chair, my mind drifted to the chapel. Mother Superior had asked me to lead daily reflections for the retreat, a task that weighed heavily on my heart. I was supposed to spend this hour in quiet study, preparing my thoughts and prayers, not fussing over pool furniture. The expectation to be a model of spiritual focus pressed against the practical demands of my lifeguard duties. I stood there, torn, the pool chairs on one side and my Bible on the other, feeling the tension between the world\u2019s order and the soul\u2019s calling."}
