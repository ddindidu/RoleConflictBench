As a lifeguard, I knew every second counted\u2014one slip, one missed cry for help, and someone\u2019s life could change forever. The tide was high, the waves rough, and the beach was packed. My whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder of my duty.\n\nBut today was also a special day for me as a Hindu. Just beyond the dunes, I could see the vibrant colors of the festival\u2014marigold garlands, incense smoke curling into the sky, the rhythmic beat of drums. My heart ached to join, to offer prayers, to feel the warmth of my community. I caught glimpses of the rituals, the familiar chants calling to me, promising a sense of belonging and peace.\n\nYet, every time I let my gaze linger on the festival, guilt gnawed at me. My duty as a lifeguard demanded unwavering focus, but my soul yearned for the spiritual connection of the festival. I stood torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which call to answer."}
