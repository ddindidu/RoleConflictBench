The chief surgeon\u2019s email blinked on my screen, reminding me of the importance of seamless emergency routes and perfectly functional operating rooms. My phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from my spouse: \u201cHe\u2019s struggling with his Torah portion. Bar mitzvah is in three weeks. He needs you.\u201d I glanced at the clock. I had promised to help my son tonight, to sit with him and guide him through the ancient words, to pass on the traditions that shaped me. But the hospital project was at a critical stage, and any mistake could cost lives. My mind raced, torn between the weight of professional responsibility and the sacred duty to my family and faith. The blueprints blurred as I imagined my son\u2019s anxious face, the pride and pressure in his eyes. I felt the expectations pressing in from both sides, each role demanding more than I could give, and I wondered how I could possibly choose."}
