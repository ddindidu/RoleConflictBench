As the lead architect for the new high-rise hospital, every line I drew had to meet strict safety codes\u2014lives would depend on my diligence. My phone buzzed with messages from the site, urgent questions about fire exits and structural reinforcements. I knew I couldn\u2019t afford a single oversight.\n\nYet, as the afternoon sun slanted through my office window, I felt the familiar tug of my other life. My faith as a Hindu called for daily rituals\u2014lighting a lamp, offering flowers, chanting prayers. Lately, I\u2019d been squeezing in a quick mantra under my breath, barely a whisper between meetings. Guilt gnawed at me; my family expected more, and so did I. The rituals were meant to ground me, to bring peace, but now they felt like another demand I was failing to meet.\n\nCaught between the relentless pace of construction deadlines and the quiet pull of my spiritual duties, I stared at the plans, heart pounding, unsure which expectation I was about to let down."}
