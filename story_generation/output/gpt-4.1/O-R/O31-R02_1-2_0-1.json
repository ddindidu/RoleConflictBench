Can you respond?\u201d I glanced at my watch\u2014fifteen minutes until the main weekly service, the one I led as the community\u2019s priest. My congregation would already be gathering, expecting me to guide them in prayer, to offer comfort and wisdom. But as a police officer, I was sworn to uphold the law, to respond when the peace was disturbed. The dispatcher\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, mingling with the silent prayers I knew my parishioners were already whispering. I felt the weight of my badge pressing against my collar, the collar of my clerical shirt beneath it. If I ignored the call, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to the city. If I went, I\u2019d be letting down the faithful who looked to me for spiritual guidance. My hands trembled on the steering wheel, torn between the siren and the sanctuary, between order and grace."}
