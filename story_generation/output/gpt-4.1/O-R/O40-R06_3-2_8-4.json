The damage was worse than I\u2019d thought, and the family looked at me with anxious eyes, hoping I could make their home safe again. They needed an urgent repair plan, and I knew it would take all weekend to get the job done right. As a carpenter, I felt the weight of their trust and the responsibility to act quickly.\n\nBut Sunday was approaching, and with it, my commitment to attend church. I\u2019d promised myself and my faith community that I would be present every week, not just for worship but to support others and grow in my faith. The thought of missing service gnawed at me, making me feel as if I was letting down not just myself, but God and my church family. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between the urgent needs of this family and the spiritual nourishment and fellowship I craved. My mind raced, searching for a way to honor both roles, but the hours were slipping away, and I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
