The operator, new and eager, kept adjusting the settings despite my repeated instructions. Each time, the machine spat out another batch of wasted material, and my supervisor\u2019s eyes bore into me, expecting me to fix not just the machine, but the operator\u2019s habits. I was about to walk him through the process again when my phone buzzed. It was a reminder: the bar mitzvah I\u2019d been preparing for months was about to begin. Families were gathering, waiting for me to lead the ceremony, to guide a young boy into adulthood. My heart pounded. Here, I was needed as a repairer, a mentor in the world of machines. There, I was needed as a rabbi, a spiritual guide at a pivotal moment. Both roles demanded my presence, my patience, my expertise. I felt the weight of expectation pressing from both sides, the impossible pull between two worlds, and I stood frozen, torn, as the minutes ticked by."}
