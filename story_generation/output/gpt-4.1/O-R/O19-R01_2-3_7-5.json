My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the church deacon. The storm last night had flooded several homes, and families were gathering at the church, desperate for comfort and guidance. As a pharmacist, I knew how important it was to stay current, to give my patients the best advice and care. But as a pastor, my congregation needed me now, not later. I could picture Mrs. Evans, her house likely underwater, waiting for a reassuring word. The workshop was a rare chance to learn, but my heart ached for my community. I felt torn, the weight of both white coat and collar pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my best. My hands trembled as I stared at my phone, caught between duty and devotion, not knowing which call to answer first."}
