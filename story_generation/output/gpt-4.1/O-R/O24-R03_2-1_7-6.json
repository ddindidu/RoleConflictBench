The attorney\u2019s words from this morning echoed in my mind\u2014a new appellate decision, handed down just last week, could shift the entire direction of the case before me. As a judge, I am expected to be diligent, to stay current with every legal precedent, and I know I must read and analyze the decision before tomorrow\u2019s session. Yet, as I glance at the clock, I remember the quiet afternoon I had set aside for myself as a nun. My spiritual study and reflection are not just habits; they are the core of my faith, the time when I reconnect with God and seek guidance. The legal document sits unopened on my desk, while my well-worn prayer book waits on the windowsill. The demands of justice and the call of my spiritual life pull at me from opposite sides, each insistent, each important. My heart aches with the weight of choosing, knowing that whichever I set aside, I will feel the loss."}
