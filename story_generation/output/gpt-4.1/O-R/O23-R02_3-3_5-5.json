The courthouse was only a few blocks away, and in less than an hour, I was expected to stand before the jury, defending my client in a trial that could change their life forever. The stakes were high, and my client\u2019s family was counting on me to be sharp, focused, and present. As I reviewed my notes, the church secretary knocked, her voice trembling. \u201cThere\u2019s someone here who needs you. He\u2019s in crisis\u2014he says he can\u2019t go on.\u201d I glanced at the clock, my heart pounding. As a priest, I was called to offer comfort, to listen, to be the steady hand in someone\u2019s darkest hour. But as a lawyer, I was bound by duty to my client, to the court, to justice. Both roles demanded my full presence, my compassion, my expertise. I felt torn, the expectations of two worlds pulling me apart, and I sat frozen, wrestling with which part of myself I could bear to let down."}
