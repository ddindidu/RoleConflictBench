The sessions were crucial\u2014new guidelines on diabetes management, updates on drug interactions, all essential for my work as a pharmacist. My license depended on staying current, and my patients trusted me to know the latest. But as I scanned the agenda, my heart sank. The most important workshops were scheduled for Sunday mornings, the same time as church service. I hadn\u2019t been to worship in weeks, always telling myself I\u2019d go when time allowed. My church community expected me to be present, to worship together, to serve and grow in faith. I missed the sense of belonging, the peace I felt singing hymns and praying with others. Now, I felt torn\u2014my profession demanded my attention, but so did my faith. I stared at the calendar, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to choose."}
