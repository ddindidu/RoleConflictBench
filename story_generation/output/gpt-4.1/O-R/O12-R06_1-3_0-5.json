The module worked, but it was messy\u2014patches on top of patches. With the generous deadline, I could refactor it, make it clean and efficient, just as I always promised myself and my team. But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the church service tonight. It wasn\u2019t just about showing up; I was expected to be present, to worship, to help set up chairs, and to join the small group discussion afterward. My church community counted on me, and I wanted to be there, to live out my faith and support others. Yet, the thought of leaving this code as it was gnawed at me. If I went to church, I\u2019d have to rush the refactoring later, maybe cut corners. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the fellowship and the sense of belonging that grounded me. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, torn between my commitment to excellence at work and my devotion to my faith community."}
