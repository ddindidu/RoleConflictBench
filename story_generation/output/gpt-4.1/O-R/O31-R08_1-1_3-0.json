I planned to go to the gym, knowing how important it is to stay fit\u2014my duty to protect citizens and property depends on my strength and readiness. As I laced up my sneakers, I glanced at the Quran on my bedside table. As a Muslim, I\u2019m expected to recite and reflect on its verses, especially when I have free time. The quiet evening seemed perfect for spiritual reflection, something I\u2019d been neglecting lately. But the gym also called to me, reminding me of my responsibility to my community and my own health. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. Should I use this rare free time to strengthen my body for my work, or nourish my soul and fulfill my religious duty? The expectations from both sides felt equally important, and I sat on the edge of my bed, wrestling with the choice, uncertain which path to take."}
