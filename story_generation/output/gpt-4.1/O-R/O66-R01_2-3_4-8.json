As a taxi driver, I knew I had to be extra cautious\u2014traffic laws weren\u2019t just rules, they were lifelines, especially with cars darting unpredictably between lanes. My hands gripped the wheel tighter every time a brake light flashed ahead. But my mind kept drifting to the church hall, where I was supposed to lead an intensive workshop in just an hour. The community leaders were counting on me to guide them through challenging theological concepts, to help them find clarity and purpose. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing on me, even as I tried to focus on the road. Every minute I spent in traffic, I imagined the group waiting, growing restless, maybe even doubting my commitment. I wrestled with the urge to speed up, to take risks I knew I shouldn\u2019t, just to make it on time. The tension between my duty to drive safely and my calling to teach gnawed at me, each demand pulling me in a different direction as the rain kept falling."}
