The news hit her hard\u2014she was sobbing, clutching my hand, her eyes searching mine for comfort. As a nursing assistant, I knew I needed to stay by her side, offer her a listening ear, and help her process the fear and sadness. My heart ached for her, and I wanted nothing more than to sit with her, to be the steady presence she needed in that moment.\n\nBut just as I was about to pull up a chair, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mark, a member of my congregation. He was in the waiting room, desperate to talk. His family was falling apart, and he needed his pastor\u2014needed me\u2014to listen, to pray, to offer hope. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be present, compassionate, and unwavering. My mind raced, torn between the bedside and the waiting room, between my patient\u2019s tears and my parishioner\u2019s plea, unsure how to be enough for both."}
