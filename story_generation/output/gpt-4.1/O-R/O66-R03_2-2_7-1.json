We\u2019ll split the fare,\u201d one said, urgency in her voice. I nodded, feeling the familiar tug of duty\u2014professional, courteous, efficient. As I opened the trunk, my phone buzzed. A message from Sister Agnes: \u201cThe Johnsons\u2019 house caught fire. They need food and clothes now. Can you come?\u201d My heart clenched. The Johnsons lived just a few blocks away, and I knew how much they depended on our convent\u2019s charity. I glanced at the travelers, their hopeful faces, and then at my phone, picturing the Johnsons\u2019 frightened children. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to serve my passengers with care and the call to serve my neighbors in crisis. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, and I stood frozen, keys in hand, caught between two worlds that needed me at the very same moment."}
