Every detail had to be perfect\u2014one slip could mean disaster for the patient. My mind was focused, but then I overheard hushed voices from the back office. Words like \u201cshortage,\u201d \u201csubstitute,\u201d and \u201cprofit\u201d drifted out, and my heart pounded as I realized what was happening. Someone was planning to swap out a patient\u2019s medication for a cheaper, less effective alternative, pocketing the difference. As a pharmacist, my duty was clear: dispense the correct medication, protect the patient. But as a Hindu, I was raised to uphold dharma, to act with honesty and courage, to never turn away from wrongdoing. My hands trembled as I weighed the risks\u2014if I spoke up, I could lose my job, but if I stayed silent, I\u2019d betray both my profession and my faith. The pressure of these expectations pressed in on me, and I felt trapped between my white coat and my conscience, unable to move forward."}
