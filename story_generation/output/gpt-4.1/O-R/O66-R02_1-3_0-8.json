He\u2019d mentioned his meeting was casual, no rush, just a friendly catch-up. As I navigated the city streets, my phone buzzed with a message from the parish secretary: the Martinez family needed a last-minute, mandatory preparation session for their daughter\u2019s sacrament\u2014tonight, before the ceremony tomorrow. My chest tightened. As a taxi driver, I owed my passenger a safe, comfortable ride, and I couldn\u2019t just abandon him mid-journey. But as a priest, I was responsible for guiding families through these sacred milestones, and the Martinez family was counting on me to be present, to offer reassurance and spiritual guidance. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me\u2014the driver\u2019s cap and the priest\u2019s collar\u2014each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to put their needs first. My hands gripped the steering wheel, heart pounding, as I wrestled with the impossible choice ahead."}
