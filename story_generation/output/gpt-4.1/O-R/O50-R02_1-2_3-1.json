The machines needed me\u2014without my careful hands, the factory\u2019s heart would stutter and stall. I could already hear my supervisor\u2019s voice: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any downtime, not now.\u201d I knew every bolt and belt, every hiss and hum, and I took pride in keeping them alive.\n\nBut as I wiped the grease from my fingers, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the main weekly service at the temple. The community would gather, waiting for me to lead them in prayer, to offer comfort and guidance. Their faith in me was as real as the faith I tried to nurture in them. I pictured the expectant faces, the hush before the first chant, the weight of their hopes.\n\nBoth worlds pulled at me\u2014one demanding my skill, the other my spirit. I felt the pressure building, the impossibility of being fully present in both places at once. My chest tightened as I wondered how I could choose between the machines that needed my hands and the people who needed my heart."}
