As a telemarketer, I was expected to handle every objection, to keep the conversation moving, and to close the sale. But today, the calls were different. Prospects kept asking detailed technical questions\u2014questions the script only half-answered. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cStick to the script, don\u2019t get sidetracked, and never admit what you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nBut as a Christian, honesty was non-negotiable. I remembered Sunday\u2019s sermon about truthfulness, about letting your \u201cyes\u201d be yes and your \u201cno\u201d be no. Each time a customer asked if the service could really do everything we claimed, I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. The script nudged me to gloss over the gaps, to redirect, to keep the sale alive. But my faith demanded transparency, even if it meant losing a commission. My finger hovered over the mute button, my heart pounding as I wrestled with what to say next."}
