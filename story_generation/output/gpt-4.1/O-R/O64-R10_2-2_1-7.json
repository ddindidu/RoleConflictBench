The line of customers stretched down the aisle, each one impatiently shifting their weight, clutching groceries and glancing at their watches. As a cashier, I knew I had to process every transaction quickly and accurately\u2014mistakes meant angry customers and more delays. But today wasn\u2019t just any day. My family was waiting for me at home, the house already filled with the scent of incense and marigold garlands for the festival ceremony. As a Hindu, it was my duty to be there, dressed in my best, to offer prayers and join in the rituals that connected me to my faith and my family.\n\nEvery beep of the scanner felt like a countdown. My manager\u2019s eyes flicked toward me, silently urging me to keep the line moving. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014another message from my mother, asking when I\u2019d arrive. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Should I stay and fulfill my responsibility to my job, or leave to honor my family and faith? The conflict twisted inside me, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds."}
