Each customer who approaches gets a warm smile and a gentle \u201cHow are you today?\u201d\u2014it\u2019s part of my job to make them feel welcome, to be present and attentive. But as I hand a receipt to an elderly woman, my mind drifts to the clock. The weekly meditation group meets in less than ten minutes, and I promised myself I\u2019d be there, sitting in stillness with my sangha, practicing mindfulness as my teacher instructed. \n\nA new customer enters, arms full of groceries, and I greet him, but my heart is racing.
