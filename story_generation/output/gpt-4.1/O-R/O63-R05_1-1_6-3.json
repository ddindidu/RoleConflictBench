The call volume was unusually light, and my supervisor had just sent a message: \u201cFeel free to take your break whenever you need today.\u201d I felt a rare sense of freedom, but it was quickly overshadowed by a familiar tug. Tonight was the optional adult education class at the synagogue, a session I\u2019d planned on teaching about the ethical lessons in the weekly Torah portion. It wasn\u2019t mandatory, but I knew a few regulars would be disappointed if I didn\u2019t show. \n\nMy headset itched against my ear as I weighed my options. If I took my break now, I could log off early and make it to the class on time, fulfilling my role as rabbi and teacher. But the telemarketer in me hesitated\u2014my job required me to stick to my hours, and even with the supervisor\u2019s flexibility, I worried about setting a bad example or being seen as unreliable. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding loyalty, each whispering that the other could wait. My heart pounded as I stared at the blinking cursor, caught between two worlds, unsure which duty to honor."}
