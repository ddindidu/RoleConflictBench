The foreman\u2019s voice echoed, \u201cWe need you on the beam, now!\u201d I glanced at the crane, its steel arm trembling as it held the massive beam aloft. My hands itched to grab the guide rope, to do my part, to not let the crew down. But in my pocket, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from the monastery. Today was the festival, the one day each year when every hand was needed for the dawn preparations. I could almost hear the monks chanting, smell the incense, feel the peace of the temple grounds. My heart pulled in two directions: the urgent, physical demand of the site, and the quiet, spiritual call of my community. Sweat prickled my brow, not just from the work ahead, but from the weight of choosing which part of myself to honor."}
