I glanced at the clock\u2014right on schedule for my daily ritual, a sacred time I never missed. But there she was, a new client, her eyes darting nervously around the room, clutching her purse as if it were a lifeline. I knew what was expected of me as a hairdresser: greet her warmly, offer her tea, make her feel at ease. Yet, my heart pounded with the weight of my other role. My prayer mat was already laid out in the back room, incense ready, the mantras echoing in my mind. If I delayed, I\u2019d disrupt the rhythm of my spiritual practice, something my family and I held dear. But if I excused myself now, would she feel unwelcome, maybe even leave? The demands of both worlds pressed in on me, each insistent, each important. I stood frozen, caught between the gentle call of my faith and the immediate needs of the woman waiting at the door."}
