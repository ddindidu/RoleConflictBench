Her lips pressed into a thin line, and I could sense her disappointment before she even spoke. As a hairdresser, I knew I had to address her concerns, reassure her, and maybe even redo the color if she asked. My manager always emphasized that client satisfaction was everything, and I prided myself on my professionalism. \n\nBut as she hesitated, her eyes flicked to the snack table. \u201cDo you mind if I have something while we talk?\u201d she asked, reaching for a pastry. I froze. The salon often provided snacks for clients, but today, someone had brought in a box of non-kosher treats. I\u2019d already set aside my own kosher snacks in the pantry, but now I was torn. If I stopped her, I risked making her feel unwelcome or distracted from her hair concerns. If I said nothing, I\u2019d be complicit in breaking my own standards, even if only by association. My mind raced, caught between my duty to my client and my commitment to my faith, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
