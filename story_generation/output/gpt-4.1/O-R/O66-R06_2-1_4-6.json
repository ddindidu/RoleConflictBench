As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: keep a safe distance, drive defensively, especially in weather like this. But the cars around me darted in and out of lanes, impatient and reckless, making every moment tense. My hands gripped the wheel tighter. In the back seat, an elderly woman clutched her purse, her voice trembling as she asked if I could hurry\u2014her husband was in the hospital, and she was afraid she\u2019d be too late.\n\nAs a Christian, I felt the pull to show her kindness, to do what I could to ease her fear. I wanted to reassure her, maybe even speed up a little, to get her there faster. But the rain, the traffic, the rules\u2014they pressed in on me. I could feel the expectations of my job and my faith colliding, my heart pounding as I wrestled with what to do next."}
