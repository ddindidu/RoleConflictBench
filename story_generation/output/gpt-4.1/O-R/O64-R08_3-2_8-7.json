My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cStay cheerful, no matter what.\u201d The woman in front of me slams her groceries on the belt, her voice sharp and impatient. I force a smile, swallowing my frustration, reminding myself that as a cashier, I\u2019m expected to be the calm in the storm, especially during the holiday rush. But my thoughts keep drifting to the envelope of savings tucked away at home, the one I\u2019ve guarded for years, meant for Hajj. My friends are going this season, sending me photos of their preparations, their excitement infectious. I feel the weight of my faith, the longing to fulfill this pillar of Islam, pressing against the demands of my job. If I take time off now, I risk losing my position, maybe even dipping into my Hajj savings to cover lost wages. The customer\u2019s glare snaps me back. I apologize, my voice trembling, caught between the expectations of my faith and the reality of my work. My heart aches with the impossible choice looming before me."}
