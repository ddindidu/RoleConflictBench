The contractor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need this done by tomorrow, and the electrician\u2019s coming in two hours.\u201d My hands moved quickly, but my mind was restless, aware of the ticking clock and the pressure from the team to keep the project on schedule. \n\nYet, as I glanced at my phone, I saw the reminder for our weekly meditation group. An hour of stillness, of mindful breathing, awaited me\u2014something I promised myself and my sangha I would never miss. The expectation to be present, to cultivate peace, pressed against the urgency of my work. I felt torn, my heart pulled between the clamor of hammers and the quiet of the meditation hall. The demands of my craft and my spiritual path collided, leaving me standing in the workshop, tools in hand, wrestling with the weight of both worlds."}
