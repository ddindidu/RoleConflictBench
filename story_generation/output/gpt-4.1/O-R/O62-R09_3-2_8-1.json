As a lifeguard, I\u2019m expected to enforce the rules\u2014no swimming in the deep end without a test. Suddenly, I spot a child flailing in the restricted area, panic on their face. My body tenses, ready to act, but my mind is elsewhere. The Jewish holiday is just days away, and I promised the kids I\u2019d teach them the blessings and stories they need to know. Their parents are counting on me to pass on our traditions, to make sure the children feel connected to their heritage. I feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the urgent need to keep everyone safe, and the deep responsibility to nurture their Jewish identity. My heart pounds as I wrestle with what to do next, torn between the pool\u2019s immediate danger and the looming holiday\u2019s spiritual demands."}
