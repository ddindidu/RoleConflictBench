As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to take my breaks exactly as scheduled\u2014no more, no less. Management watches our break logs like hawks, reminding us that every minute away from the phones means longer wait times for customers. I feel the pressure to perform, to be efficient, to not let the queue grow.\n\nBut as a Muslim, I carry another expectation deep in my heart: the obligation to perform Hajj. My parents remind me gently, and I see friends posting photos from Mecca, their faces glowing with fulfillment. I want to go, to answer that call, but I\u2019m early in my career and my savings are meager. The cost of the pilgrimage feels impossibly high, especially when every hour at work is accounted for, every break scrutinized.\n\nI stare at the break schedule, my mind racing. Should I ask for extra hours to save faster, risking exhaustion and management\u2019s disapproval? Or should I stick to the rules, knowing it will take years before I can afford Hajj? The weight of both worlds presses on me, and I can\u2019t see a way to satisfy them both."}
