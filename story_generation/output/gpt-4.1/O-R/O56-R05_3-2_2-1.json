I put on my warmest smile, welcoming them, trying to ease their anxiety. My hands moved quickly, sectioning hair, offering calming words, but my mind kept drifting. In just a few hours, I was expected at the synagogue, where the congregation would be waiting for my Shabbat sermon. I hadn\u2019t finished preparing my message, and the weight of that responsibility pressed on me. As a hairdresser, I was supposed to be fully present, attentive, and reassuring, especially on a day as important as this for my client. But as a rabbi, I was expected to offer spiritual guidance, to be composed and ready to lead. The laughter and chatter in the salon clashed with the quiet reflection I needed. My heart pounded as I tried to balance the scissors in my hand with the words forming in my head, feeling the pull of both worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my all to both at the same time."}
