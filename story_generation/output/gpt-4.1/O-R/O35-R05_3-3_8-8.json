My supervisor\u2019s sudden entrance into the cabin made my heart pound\u2014an unannounced audit meant every move would be scrutinized. I straightened my posture, recalling every protocol drilled into me: precise stops, clear announcements, unwavering focus. Then my phone vibrated in my pocket. I glanced at the screen\u2014three missed calls from the synagogue president, a text: \u201cMiriam\u2019s father passed. Family needs you for the funeral, as soon as possible.\u201d My mind spun.
