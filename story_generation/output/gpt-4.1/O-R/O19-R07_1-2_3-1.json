She asked if it was safe to take with her blood pressure medication. My mind raced through the possible interactions, but I knew the temple\u2019s memorial service would begin in less than an hour. The community expected me there, not just as a participant, but as someone who helps lead the chanting. Yet, here I was, behind the counter, my white coat a stark contrast to the saffron robes I would soon wear. The woman looked at me, waiting for reassurance, and I felt the weight of my responsibility as a pharmacist\u2014to ensure her safety, to offer more than a rushed answer. But the thought of the temple hall filling without me, the sense of letting down my Buddhist community, gnawed at me. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my presence, each expectation valid and urgent. I took a breath, feeling the tension coil inside me, knowing I had to choose which part of myself to honor in this moment."}
