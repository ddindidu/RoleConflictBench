As a judge, I know I must stay current, and I feel the weight of expectation\u2014my rulings depend on my knowledge. Yet, as I reach for the journal, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the office function is this afternoon. I glance at my reflection, noting my modest attire, carefully chosen to align with my faith as a Muslim. The event will be filled with colleagues of all genders, and I sense the subtle pressure to blend in, to perhaps relax my dress code just this once. My mind races\u2014should I spend the next hour immersed in legal scholarship, or should I focus on preparing for the function, maybe even reconsider my outfit to avoid standing out? The demands of my profession and my faith pull me in opposite directions, and I feel the tension rising within me, unsure which expectation I should honor first."}
