As a construction laborer, I was always alert, always watching for danger. Today, the crane operator was moving a heavy load overhead, and I caught sight of Miguel, distracted, about to step right under it. My heart pounded\u2014I knew I had to shout, to break the noise and warn him, just as I\u2019d done before. But then my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder: the daily prayer service was about to begin. As the priest, the community expected me to lead them, to be calm, composed, and present in the chapel, not yelling on a construction site. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014one demanding immediate action to keep my coworker safe, the other expecting my quiet, spiritual leadership. My throat tightened as I stood between the roar of the site and the silent call of the chapel, torn by the impossible timing and the expectations that seemed to pull me apart."}
