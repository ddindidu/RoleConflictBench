His train was leaving in twenty minutes, and the station was clear across town. As a taxi driver, I knew I was expected to get him there safely and on time, weaving through the city\u2019s snarled traffic with practiced skill. But my phone buzzed with a message from the mayor\u2014another reminder that the hurricane had left hundreds homeless, and as a nun, I was needed at the church to help organize the relief effort. My sisters were already there, sorting blankets and food, and the community expected me to lead. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, heart pounding with the weight of both responsibilities. The passenger\u2019s anxious glances in the rearview mirror pressed me to hurry, but the faces of those in need haunted my thoughts. I felt torn, the city\u2019s chaos outside mirroring the storm inside me, as I wrestled with which duty to answer first."}
