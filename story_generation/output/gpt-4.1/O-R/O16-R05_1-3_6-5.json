My next patient, a young woman with a sore throat, waited anxiously outside. As her doctor, I needed to examine her, confirm the strep diagnosis, and prescribe antibiotics\u2014nothing complicated, but she looked worried, and I wanted to reassure her. Yet my phone buzzed with a reminder: the conversion candidate\u2019s final study session was about to begin at the synagogue. As their rabbi, I was expected to guide them through the last, crucial questions before their Beit Din, a moment they\u2019d been preparing for over a year. Both roles demanded my full presence\u2014one for physical healing, the other for spiritual transformation. I felt torn, my mind racing with the weight of responsibility. If I delayed the patient, her illness might worsen or her trust in me falter. If I missed the study session, I could jeopardize the candidate\u2019s confidence and readiness. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood frozen, caught between the call of medicine and the call of faith, unsure which path to take first."}
