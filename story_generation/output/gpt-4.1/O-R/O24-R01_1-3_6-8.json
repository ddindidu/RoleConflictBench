As a judge, I know I must stay current\u2014my rulings depend on it. Yet, my phone buzzes with reminders: the church\u2019s workshop for community leaders begins in an hour. As their pastor, I\u2019m expected to guide them through intricate theological concepts, helping them apply faith to daily life. Both roles demand my full attention. I glance at the unopened journal, feeling the weight of my judicial duty, then at my sermon notes, sensing the congregation\u2019s trust. My mind races\u2014if I focus on the law, I neglect my flock; if I pour myself into the workshop, I risk falling behind in my legal responsibilities. The expectations press in from both sides, and I sit at my desk, torn, heart pounding, unable to choose which calling to answer first."}
