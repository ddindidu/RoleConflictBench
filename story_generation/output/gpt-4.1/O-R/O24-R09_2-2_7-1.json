The attorney\u2019s words replay in my mind: a new appellate decision, handed down just last week, could shift the entire case. As a judge, I know I must read it thoroughly, analyze its implications, and be ready to address it in tomorrow\u2019s session. The law demands my diligence, and I feel the weight of justice pressing on my shoulders.\n\nBut as I glance at the clock, my heart tightens. The holiday is almost here, and my children are waiting in the living room, their voices drifting down the hall. They still haven\u2019t learned the blessings for the festival, and it\u2019s my responsibility to teach them\u2014not just the words, but the meaning, the history, the warmth of our tradition. I promised them we\u2019d practice tonight.\n\nI stare at the legal brief in my hand, then at the Hebrew prayer book on the table. Both roles call to me, urgent and uncompromising. I feel torn, the expectations of the bench and my faith pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding all of me, neither willing to wait."}
