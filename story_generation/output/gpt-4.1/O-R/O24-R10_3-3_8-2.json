Suddenly, my clerk slips me a note\u2014urgent, trembling. The Supreme Court has just overturned the very precedent I\u2019m explaining. My mind races. I must halt, review, and adapt, for justice demands I stay current, impartial, and precise. The courtroom\u2019s eyes are on me, waiting.\n\nBut my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a silent alarm. It\u2019s time for my midday puja, the sacred ritual I never miss. My faith is woven into my day, each prayer a thread of devotion. I promised myself, and my family, that I would never let my duties as a Hindu slip, no matter what.\n\nNow, I\u2019m torn. The law demands my immediate attention; my soul aches for the peace of ritual. I feel the weight of the black robe and the sacred thread around my neck, both heavy, both binding. The courtroom is silent, the altar in my mind calls. I stand, caught between two worlds, unsure which duty to honor first."}
