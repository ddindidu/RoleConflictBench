A young woman lies in the ER, her fever raging, infection spreading fast. The protocol is clear: she needs a powerful antibiotic, and she needs it now. My pager buzzes again\u2014this time, a gentle reminder from the temple. Tonight is the memorial service, a sacred ceremony I promised to help lead. The community expects my presence, my calm chanting, my guidance. I feel the tug of both worlds: the urgent, clinical demand to heal, and the spiritual, communal call to honor the dead. My mind races with the expectations\u2014my patient\u2019s life may depend on my swift action, but my absence at the temple would be a deep disappointment, a break in the trust I\u2019ve built. I stand in the hallway, torn, the sounds of the hospital and the imagined chants of the temple swirling together, my heart pounding as I wrestle with what to do next."}
