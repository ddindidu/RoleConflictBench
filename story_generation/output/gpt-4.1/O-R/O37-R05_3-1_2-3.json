The manager had just reminded me that every room needed to be deep cleaned today\u2014no shortcuts, no missed corners. I could already feel the ache in my back from scrubbing the last bathroom, but I knew the expectation: spotless floors, sanitized surfaces, everything gleaming. As I glanced at my watch, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014the adult education class at the synagogue was starting in twenty minutes. I was supposed to be there, ready to teach, to answer questions, to guide those who dropped in seeking wisdom or comfort. I imagined the circle of chairs, the hopeful faces, the Torah open before me. But here I was, surrounded by cleaning supplies, with three more rooms left to do. My heart pounded with anxiety. If I left now, the cleaning wouldn\u2019t be finished, and I\u2019d let down my supervisor and coworkers. If I stayed, I\u2019d disappoint my community, those who counted on me for learning and connection. I stood frozen, torn between the mop and the Torah, the demands of two worlds pulling me apart."}
