The construction detour had squeezed us into a single lane, and just ahead, the yellow sign warned: SCHOOL ZONE. Children clustered near the curb, their laughter rising above the honking horns. As a taxi driver, I knew the rules\u2014slow down, stay alert, protect these kids at all costs. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the community gathering at the church started in ten minutes. I was the pastor, expected to open with a story about compassion and patience, to guide my congregation in living out our faith.\n\nMy mind raced. If I followed every traffic law to the letter, I\u2019d be late, letting down those who looked to me for spiritual leadership. But if I hurried, even a little, I\u2019d risk the safety of these children and betray the trust placed in me as a driver. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, the collar and the cap, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My heart pounded as I watched the crossing guard raise her hand, signaling us to stop."}
