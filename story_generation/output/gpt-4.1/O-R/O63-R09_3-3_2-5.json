He was furious, convinced our latest offer was a scam, and demanded I explain every detail. My manager\u2019s eyes flicked over, expecting me to keep him calm and close the sale. I tried to steady my voice, answering each objection, but my mind kept drifting to the lunch break ahead. Today was the company\u2019s big communal meal, and I\u2019d already seen the trays\u2014none of the food was kosher, and there was no way to bring in my own. My coworkers expected me to join in, to be part of the team, but I couldn\u2019t ignore my dietary laws. The pressure built as I juggled Mr. Goldstein\u2019s questions and the knowledge that soon I\u2019d have to choose between fitting in at work and staying true to my faith.
