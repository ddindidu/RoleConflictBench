My fingers move quickly over the register, scanning barcodes, counting change, trying not to make a mistake. The manager glances over, reminding me with a look that accuracy and speed are everything during the rush. But my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a calendar alert. The planning meeting for the adult faith formation series at church is starting in ten minutes. As a priest, I\u2019m expected to guide and inspire, to be present and prepared for the community\u2019s spiritual growth. I know the team is waiting, expecting me to lead the discussion and set the vision for the coming months. My heart pounds as I glance at the clock, torn between the demands of the checkout and the call to serve my parish. I can\u2019t leave the register unmanned, but I can\u2019t let down my fellow parishioners either. The weight of both uniforms\u2014apron and collar\u2014presses on me, and I stand frozen, caught between two worlds that both need me, right now."}
