It was only Wednesday, and I was already on track to surpass my weekly quota. The thrill of achievement buzzed in my chest, but it was quickly overshadowed by the memory of the abbot\u2019s gentle reminder: the monastery\u2019s annual festival began at dawn tomorrow, and volunteers were needed for the preparations. As a practicing Buddhist, I was expected to be present, to help set up the altar, arrange offerings, and welcome the community with a calm, open heart.\n\nBut the phone lines would be busiest tomorrow, and my supervisor had hinted at a bonus for those who kept up the momentum. The pressure to keep dialing, to keep selling, pressed against the quiet call of my spiritual community. I felt torn\u2014between the relentless drive to achieve and the peaceful duty to serve. My mind raced, caught between the ringing phones and the sound of temple bells, wondering how I could possibly honor both worlds without letting one down."}
