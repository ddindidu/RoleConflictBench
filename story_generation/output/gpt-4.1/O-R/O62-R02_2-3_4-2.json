As I walked the deck, my eyes caught the frayed lane rope, its fibers split and tangled. Swim lessons would start in an hour, and without a fixed rope, the kids would be at risk, the lessons thrown into chaos. My duty as a lifeguard was clear: safety and order, equipment ready and reliable. But as I knelt to inspect the damage, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of the most significant religious holiday of the year. The congregation would be gathering soon, waiting for me to lead the prayers, to offer guidance and comfort. I could already picture the expectant faces, the sense of community that only I could foster as their priest. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds: the urgent need to repair the rope, and the sacred call to serve my faith. I stood there, torn, the minutes ticking by, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
