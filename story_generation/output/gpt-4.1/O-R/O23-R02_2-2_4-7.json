The contested motion for my client was set for Thursday afternoon\u2014the same time as the weekly religious education class I led for the parish children. As a lawyer, my client depended on me to argue their case, to protect their interests in a hearing that could change everything for them. I could picture their anxious face, the trust they placed in my expertise, and the pressure to deliver results in court.\n\nBut as a priest, the children and their parents expected me to be present, to guide them in faith, to answer their questions and nurture their spiritual growth. The parish had come to rely on the stability and warmth of our weekly gatherings, and I knew how much the children looked forward to our time together.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed down on me. I felt torn, knowing that whichever responsibility I chose, I would be letting someone down. My mind raced with possible solutions, but none seemed fair. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible expectations, caught between the law and the spirit, unable to see a way forward."}
