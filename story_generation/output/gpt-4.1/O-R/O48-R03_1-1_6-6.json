Mrs. Evans looked up at me with tired eyes, her voice barely above a whisper. \u201cWould you sit with me for a while?\u201d she asked. I could see the loneliness in her face, the longing for someone to simply be present. As a nursing assistant, I knew how important it was to offer comfort, to be that gentle presence for those who needed it most. But my heart tugged in another direction. Today was one of the rare afternoons I had set aside for spiritual reading and quiet reflection\u2014a precious time as a nun to reconnect with my faith, to nourish my soul in silence and prayer. The convent was quiet, the chapel waiting. Yet here was Mrs. Evans, needing me in a different way. I felt the weight of both callings pressing on me, each demanding my full attention, each worthy in its own right. My hands fidgeted with the hem of my habit as I stood at the threshold, torn between the bedside and the chapel, between service and solitude, unsure which path to take."}
