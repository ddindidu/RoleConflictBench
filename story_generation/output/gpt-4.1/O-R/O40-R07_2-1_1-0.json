The worksite was still cluttered\u2014scraps of wood, scattered nails, tools left out by the apprentices. As the lead carpenter, it was my responsibility to ensure everything was in order, every hazard removed before we left for the night. Safety protocols weren\u2019t just rules; they were a promise I made to my crew and myself. But tonight, the temple bell echoed across the neighborhood, a gentle reminder that the evening chant would begin soon. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be present, to join the community in reciting the sutras, to help create the calm and unity that our rituals brought. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to my team\u2019s safety, and the call to spiritual practice. I could feel the tension in my chest, the weight of both expectations pressing down as I stood in the middle of the half-tidy workshop, broom in hand, listening to the distant sound of chanting begin."}
