Their voices were uncertain, and I caught snippets about skipping the safety checklist. My heart raced\u2014if they started the machine without proper guidance, someone could get hurt. As the senior repairer, it was my duty to step in, explain the protocols, and ensure everyone\u2019s safety. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: Friday prayer was in less than an hour. As the imam, the community expected me to deliver the Khutbah, a responsibility I never took lightly. Today, though, a guest speaker was ready to step in if I couldn\u2019t make it. I could picture the congregation waiting, some looking forward to my words, others perhaps needing comfort or guidance. Torn between the urgent need to prevent a possible accident and my spiritual duty to the community, I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each too important to ignore."}
