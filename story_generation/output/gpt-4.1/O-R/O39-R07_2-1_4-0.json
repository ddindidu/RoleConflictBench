My shift was nearly over when I spotted a slick, glistening puddle in the walkway\u2014oil, maybe, or something worse. I knew the rule: any spill, no matter how small, had to be cleaned up right away. Safety first, always. If someone slipped, it would be on me. I grabbed a rag and the cleaning kit, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a reminder from the temple: the evening chant would begin in fifteen minutes. As a practicing Buddhist, I was expected to be there, joining the community in reciting sutras, offering incense, and sharing in the calm that always settled over the hall.\n\nI looked at the spill, then at the time. If I stayed to clean, I\u2019d miss the opening of the ceremony, maybe all of it. If I left now, the walkway would be unsafe, and I\u2019d be letting down my coworkers. My heart pounded with the weight of both expectations, torn between duty to my job and devotion to my faith."}
