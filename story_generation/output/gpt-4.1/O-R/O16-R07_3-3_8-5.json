My white coat feels heavier than usual as I rush down the corridor, the echo of my own footsteps loud in my ears. A patient, feverish and shivering, has just been wheeled in\u2014her infection is spreading rapidly, and she needs a potent antibiotic, now. I scan her chart, my mind racing through dosages and side effects, aware that every second counts. Yet, my phone vibrates in my pocket: a gentle reminder that the weekly meditation group begins in five minutes. I am their guide, the one who leads them in mindfulness, who helps them find stillness in chaos. They count on me to be present, to embody calm and compassion.
