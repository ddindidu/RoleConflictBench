The plant was quiet\u2014production was slow, and this machine was rarely used, but today it had started acting up, glitching just enough to worry the supervisor. He wanted a full diagnostic, just in case. I could already feel the pressure: if I didn\u2019t catch the problem now, it might fail during a busy run, and everyone would look to me for answers.\n\nBut as I reached for my toolkit, my phone buzzed with a reminder. The adult education class at the synagogue was starting in half an hour. It was an optional, drop-in session, nothing formal, but I knew a few regulars counted on me to be there, to guide them through the week\u2019s Torah portion and answer their questions. I could picture their faces, eager for discussion, expecting me to show up as their rabbi, their teacher.\n\nI stared at the machine, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. The plant needed me to be the fixer, the one who kept things running. My community needed me to be the rabbi, the one who brought meaning and connection. I stood there, torn, the ticking of the machine echoing the tension inside me."}
