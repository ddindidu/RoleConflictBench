Cloud tops were rising fast, and three pilots were waiting for my revised climb instructions. My fingers hovered over the mic, ready to speak, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the High Holiday service was in less than an hour. As the rabbi, I was expected to deliver a sermon that would guide and inspire the entire congregation\u2014many of whom had already gathered, waiting for my words. My mind raced, torn between the urgent voices in my headset and the silent expectation of my community. I could feel the weight of both uniforms\u2014the crisp shirt of the controller, the tallit folded in my bag. Each role demanded my full presence, but I could not be in two places at once. The pilots\u2019 voices grew more insistent, and I imagined the congregation\u2019s anxious glances at the empty pulpit. My heart pounded as I realized I had to choose, knowing that whichever role I stepped into, I would be letting someone down."}
