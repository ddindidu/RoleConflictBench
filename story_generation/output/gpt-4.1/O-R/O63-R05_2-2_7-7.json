My break was scheduled for 2:30, but the phone queue was overflowing, and management had sent another reminder: \u201cNo unscheduled breaks. All time must be logged.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20142:15. My phone buzzed with a message from the synagogue president: \u201cWe need you here by 3:00 for the bar mitzvah. The family is anxious.\u201d I felt my stomach twist. I\u2019d promised the family months ago I would be there, guiding their son through this milestone. But if I left my desk early, I\u2019d risk a write-up, maybe even my job. My supervisor\u2019s eyes flicked over the cubicles, scanning for anyone who dared to leave their post. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to my congregation, my obligation to my employer. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to disappoint."}
