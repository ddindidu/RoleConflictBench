It was almost time for my midday prayer, the one I never missed, the one that kept me grounded. But the line at my register stretched longer than usual, and then a woman stepped forward, holding a blender and no receipt. She pleaded, explaining it was a gift, that she needed the money back. Store policy was clear: no returns without proof of purchase. My manager expected me to enforce it, no exceptions. But as I listened, I felt the minutes slipping away, my prayer window closing. My mind raced\u2014if I delayed, I\u2019d miss my ritual, breaking a promise to myself and my faith. If I rushed, I\u2019d risk making a mistake or angering the customer. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest, the store\u2019s rules on one side, my spiritual discipline on the other, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
