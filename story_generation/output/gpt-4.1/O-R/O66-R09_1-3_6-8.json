My next passenger was a regular, and I prided myself on keeping my taxi immaculate\u2014cleanliness was part of the professional service I promised. Just as I finished, my phone buzzed. It was David from the synagogue. His voice was urgent: they needed one more person for the minyan at a funeral prayer, and I was the only one nearby. I glanced at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d be late picking up my passenger, and the cab would sit unattended, possibly getting dirty again. But if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my community, missing the chance to help someone honor the dead. My mind raced between the expectations\u2014my duty to my passengers, my commitment to my faith. I stood there, keys in hand, heart pounding, torn between the two worlds that defined me."}
