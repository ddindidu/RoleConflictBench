My mind was focused, every word measured, when my clerk slipped me a note\u2014urgent, trembling. The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was explaining. My heart pounded. I was expected, as a judge, to stay current, to uphold the law as it stands, not as it was. I paused, the courtroom silent, all eyes on me, waiting for my next move.\n\nLater, at the courthouse\u2019s communal dinner, I scanned the buffet. None of the dishes bore kosher certification. My colleagues urged me to join in, plates already full, laughter echoing. I felt the familiar ache of exclusion, the expectation to participate, to be part of the team. But my faith demanded I refrain, even if it meant going hungry. The demands of my roles pressed in from all sides\u2014one requiring immediate adaptation, the other steadfast adherence. I stood, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing down, uncertain which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
