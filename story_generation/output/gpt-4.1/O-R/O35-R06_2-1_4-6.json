My radio crackled: \u201cUnattended bag in car three. Possible threat.\u201d My training as a subway operator kicked in\u2014protocol demanded I stop the train, alert authorities, and keep passengers safe. My heart pounded as I pictured frightened faces, the chaos that could erupt. But then, as I prepared to make the announcement, I caught sight of a young woman on the platform, tears streaming down her face, frantically searching the crowd. I remembered the teachings of Jesus\u2014compassion, kindness, not jumping to judgment. What if this was her bag, forgotten in a moment of distress? My duty was clear, but so was my faith\u2019s call to gentleness and understanding. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different. My hand hovered over the intercom, torn between the rules I must uphold and the mercy I longed to show."}
