A patient had just arrived in the ER, gasping for breath, his skin pale and clammy. The nurses looked to me for answers, expecting swift, decisive action. As a doctor, I knew my responsibility: to diagnose, to act quickly, to save a life. But as I glanced at my watch, I remembered the adult education class I was scheduled to teach at the synagogue in less than an hour. The topic was one I loved\u2014Torah and the meaning of compassion\u2014and several congregants had mentioned they were looking forward to it. I could picture them gathering, waiting for me to guide them, to share wisdom and tradition. My heart pounded as I weighed the urgent, immediate need of my patient against the quiet, steady expectation of my community. Both roles demanded my presence, my care, my expertise. I felt torn, the weight of incompatible expectations pressing down, unsure which path I would take."}
