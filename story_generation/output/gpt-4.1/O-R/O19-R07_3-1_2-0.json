My mind replayed the steps: check the dosage, verify the patient, double-check interactions. Any mistake could be catastrophic.

As a Buddhist, I was expected to be present, to join the community in ritual and reflection, to cultivate mindfulness and compassion. The thought of missing the ceremony filled me with guilt; these gatherings were not just tradition, but a source of spiritual nourishment and connection. But the prescription in front of me was urgent, and my professional duty as a pharmacist was clear\u2014accuracy above all else.
