As a doctor, I knew Mrs. Patel\u2019s treatment couldn\u2019t wait\u2014her autoimmune disease was flaring, and she needed a careful adjustment to her medications. The hospital expected me to monitor her closely, to be present for any sudden changes. Yet, as a priest, today was the holiest day of the year. The sanctuary would soon fill with hundreds of faithful, all looking to me for guidance, for the prayers and rituals that only I could lead. My phone buzzed with reminders from both worlds: the nurse\u2019s urgent message about Mrs. Patel\u2019s labs, and the church deacon\u2019s call about the final preparations. My heart pounded as I stared at my white coat draped over the chair and my vestments hanging by the door. Both roles demanded my presence, my care, my leadership. I felt torn, the weight of two communities pressing on my shoulders, each expecting me to be wholly theirs in this crucial moment."}
