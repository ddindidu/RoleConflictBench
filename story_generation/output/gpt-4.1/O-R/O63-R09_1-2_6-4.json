The call volume is unusually light today, and my supervisor just told us we could take our breaks whenever we wanted, as long as we didn\u2019t all leave at once. My stomach rumbles, reminding me I haven\u2019t eaten since early morning. I\u2019m traveling for work, and the only place nearby I know is kosher is a tiny vendor a few blocks away. If I wait for my official break, I might miss their lunch hours and be left with nothing but vending machine snacks I can\u2019t eat. But if I take my break now, I\u2019ll be out of sync with the schedule, and I know my team relies on me to cover certain times. I feel the pressure from both sides\u2014my job expects me to be flexible but also responsible, and my faith demands I keep kosher, even if it means inconvenience. My hand hovers over the \u201cbreak\u201d button, my mind racing with the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I should honor first."}
