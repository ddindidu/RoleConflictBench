As a judge, I know the importance of drafting a clear and detailed scheduling order for the new case assigned to me. The deadline is looming at the end of the week, and the court expects precision and timeliness. Yet, as the sun sets, the call to Maghrib prayer echoes softly from my phone. It\u2019s Ramadan\u2019s midpoint, and I\u2019m painfully aware that I\u2019ve fallen behind on my daily Quran reading. My heart aches with guilt; I promised myself I would recite and reflect more this year, to deepen my faith and connection. The expectation to fulfill my spiritual duties weighs as heavily as the legal ones. I glance at the Quran on my shelf, then back at the blinking cursor on my screen. The demands of justice and faith pull me in opposite directions, each insistent, each sacred. My mind races, torn between the order I must write and the verses I long to recite, feeling the tension tighten within me as the evening slips away."}
