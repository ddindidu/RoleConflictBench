New drug approvals, updated guidelines\u2014my mind raced to keep up. I knew I had to stay sharp, for my patients and my license. But as I scrolled, my phone buzzed with a message from my spouse: \u201cHe\u2019s struggling with his Torah portion. Can you help tonight?\u201d My son\u2019s bar mitzvah was only weeks away, and he still stumbled over the Hebrew, his confidence wavering. I was supposed to guide him, to pass on our traditions, to make sure he felt proud and prepared. Yet every evening, I found myself buried in medical journals or answering after-hours calls from the pharmacy. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my duty to my patients, my responsibility to my family and faith. I stared at the newsletter, then at the message, feeling the familiar ache of being pulled in two directions, unsure which role needed me more in this moment."}
