It was a new client, her voice hesitant but hopeful, asking if I could walk her through the basics of the machine I\u2019d just serviced. She sounded lost, and I knew how overwhelming new equipment could be. My job wasn\u2019t just to fix things, but to make sure people felt confident using them. I glanced at the clock\u2014just half an hour until the midday prayer. Today, the usual backup imam was out of town, and the congregation would be waiting for me to lead. I could already picture the expectant faces, the quiet shuffle of feet on the carpet, the trust they placed in me to guide them in worship. My heart pounded as I weighed the gentle urgency in the client\u2019s voice against the silent pull of my community\u2019s needs. Both roles demanded my presence, my guidance, and I felt the tension coil inside me, unsure which responsibility I should answer first."}
