As a police officer, I know I need to stay in top shape\u2014my job demands it. The gym is quietest early on Sundays, and it\u2019s the only time I can squeeze in a full workout without interruptions. But as a Christian, I\u2019m expected at church, not just to worship but to be part of the community, to serve and support others. My pastor often reminds us that regular attendance is a sign of commitment, and I feel the weight of that expectation every week.\n\nThis morning, as I lace up my sneakers, I glance at my Bible on the table. I can almost hear the choir warming up, the familiar voices I\u2019ve grown to love. But I also feel the pressure of my badge\u2014if I\u2019m not fit, I can\u2019t protect anyone. My mind races with guilt and anxiety, torn between my duty to my faith and my duty to my job. I stand in the hallway, keys in one hand, Bible in the other, heart pounding as I wrestle with which door to walk through."}
