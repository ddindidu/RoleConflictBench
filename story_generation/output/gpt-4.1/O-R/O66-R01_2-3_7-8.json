As a taxi driver, I knew I should help them load their bags, greet them with a smile, and make sure their ride was comfortable and fair\u2014especially since they wanted to split the fare. Professionalism meant patience, efficiency, and a willingness to serve, no matter how tired I felt after a long shift. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the workshop for community leaders was about to begin. As a pastor, I was expected to guide them through challenging theological concepts, to be present, focused, and ready to answer their questions with wisdom and compassion. I could picture the eager faces waiting for me, counting on my leadership to help them grow in faith. My heart pounded as I stood between the trunk and the taxi door, torn between the immediate needs of my passengers and the spiritual needs of my community. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I felt the tension rising, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
