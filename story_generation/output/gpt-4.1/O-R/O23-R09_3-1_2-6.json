My client was counting on me to catch any hidden pitfalls, especially the clauses that could trigger immediate financial liability. The clock ticked closer to the hour when I usually left for synagogue. Tonight was a routine service, nothing special, and I knew the minyan would be complete even if I missed it.

As a lawyer, I owed my client diligence and vigilance; as a Jew, I owed my community and myself the discipline of regular worship.
