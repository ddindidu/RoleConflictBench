As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: drive defensively, anticipate sudden stops, and never let impatience cloud my judgment\u2014especially on a night like this, with cars darting between lanes and brake lights flaring unpredictably. But as the clock on my dashboard ticked closer to sundown, my mind kept drifting to my other life. Shabbat was approaching, and I hadn\u2019t finished preparing my sermon. My congregation expected inspiration, guidance, a message that would carry them through the week. I felt the weight of their anticipation pressing on me, even as I tried to focus on the road. Every red light was a reminder of the time slipping away, every honking horn a jolt back to the present. I wrestled with the urge to rush, to cut corners, to get home in time to write and reflect. But I also knew the risks\u2014one careless move could endanger lives. My two worlds collided in the rain-soaked silence of my cab, and I sat at the intersection, torn between duty and devotion, unsure which road to take."}
