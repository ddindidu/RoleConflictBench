It\u2019s just a minor UI glitch\u2014nothing that breaks the app, and users can easily work around it. Still, the expectation is clear: I\u2019m supposed to fix it, now, before the next release. My phone buzzes with a gentle reminder: the weekly group meditation starts in fifteen minutes. I promised myself I\u2019d be present, mindful, not just physically there but truly attentive. My team expects me to be responsive, to jump on issues as soon as they arise. My sangha expects me to let go, to be still, to cultivate peace. I feel my breath catch, my mind pulled in two directions. If I stay, I\u2019ll be late for meditation, my mind racing with code and deadlines. If I leave, I\u2019ll let my team down, the bug unresolved, my inbox filling with follow-ups. My hands hover over the keyboard, heart pounding, caught between the demands of my work and the call to be present."}
