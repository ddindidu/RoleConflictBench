The roads were clear tonight, the city breathing easy under a pale sky. I had promised the temple elders I would help set up for the memorial service\u2014an important ceremony, one that called for my presence and participation as a devoted Buddhist. But my last passenger was running late, and I still had another fare to pick up before I could head to the temple. \n\nAs a taxi driver, I knew the rules: drive safely, obey every sign, never let impatience cloud my judgment. But the minutes ticked by, and the weight of my commitment to the community pressed on me. I imagined the elders waiting, the incense curling in the air, the sense of unity I would miss if I arrived late. My hands tightened on the wheel. The urge to speed up, to bend the rules just this once, gnawed at me. I felt torn\u2014between the duty to my passengers\u2019 safety and the pull of my spiritual obligations. The light turned green, and I hesitated, caught between two worlds, unsure which path to follow."}
