As the only machine repairer on shift, I rushed to the main unit, my mind already running diagnostics. The sensor error had halted everything for half an hour, and the supervisor\u2019s anxious eyes followed my every move. I knelt beside the humming machine, tools in hand, when the chapel bell echoed through the halls\u2014a gentle but insistent reminder. It was time for morning prayers, and as a nun, I was expected to be present, kneeling in the pews with my sisters, reciting the liturgy in unity. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds: the urgent need to restore the machine and the sacred call to prayer. The supervisor\u2019s expectation pressed on me, but so did the silent, watchful eyes of my fellow nuns. I felt torn, guilt rising no matter which way I leaned. My hands trembled, caught between the wrench and the rosary, as I stood at the crossroads of duty and devotion, unable to move in either direction."}
