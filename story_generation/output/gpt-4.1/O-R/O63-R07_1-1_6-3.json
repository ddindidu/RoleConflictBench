The call queue is almost empty, and my supervisor has just sent a message: \u201cFeel free to take your break early if you want.\u201d My body aches for a pause, but my mind is already elsewhere. I\u2019ve been looking forward to this window all morning, a rare chance to sit quietly and practice mindfulness, to let the noise of the day settle and my breath guide me back to center.\n\nBut as I hover over the \u201clog out\u201d button, a new call pops up. I hesitate. The telemarketer in me knows the expectation: stick to the schedule, but also be flexible, keep the calls moving, don\u2019t let the queue build up. The Buddhist in me feels the tug of commitment to my practice, the promise I made to myself to honor this ten-minute sanctuary.\n\nMy heart pounds with the pressure of these two worlds. If I take the call, I betray my intention for mindfulness. If I log out, I risk letting down my team. I sit, torn, the phone ringing, my breath shallow, caught between duty and devotion."}
