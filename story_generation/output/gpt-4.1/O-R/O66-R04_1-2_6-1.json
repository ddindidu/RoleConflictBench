The next passenger would be here any minute, and I prided myself on keeping my taxi spotless. My regulars often complimented the fresh scent and tidy seats, and I knew it was part of delivering the professional service they expected. As I finished straightening the floor mats, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque committee: the backup imam was still out of town, and the congregation was gathering soon. They needed me to lead the prayer, as everyone assumed I would step in.\n\nI looked at the time again. If I left now, I could just make it to the mosque, but I\u2019d have to cancel my next ride. The passenger, a nurse on her way to a night shift, relied on me to get her there on time. My mind raced\u2014should I let down my passenger, or disappoint the congregation waiting for me to guide them in prayer? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me not to fail. My hands trembled as I reached for my phone, torn between duty and devotion."}
