As an ambulance driver, I knew lives depended on my attention to these details. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the workshop for community leaders was about to begin. As their pastor, I was expected to guide them through challenging theological concepts, to help them wrestle with faith and apply it to their lives. I could picture the eager faces waiting for me at the church, notebooks open, expecting wisdom and clarity. But here I was, surrounded by antiseptic and gauze, torn between the immediate, tangible needs of my medical role and the spiritual, intellectual demands of my pastoral calling. My mind raced with the pressure\u2014if I left now, I\u2019d risk missing a critical supply that could save a life later. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down those who looked to me for spiritual leadership. The weight of both worlds pressed in, and I found myself frozen, unable to move, caught between two callings that both demanded all of me."}
