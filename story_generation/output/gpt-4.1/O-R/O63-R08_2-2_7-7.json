My break is scheduled for 2:15, but the phone queue is overflowing, and management has sent another reminder: \u201cNo unscheduled breaks. Every minute counts.\u201d I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of my routine. As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to stick to my schedule, to be reliable, to not let the team down. But my mind drifts to something bigger\u2014my savings for Hajj, carefully set aside for years. This season, my friends are going. They send me messages, photos of their preparations, and invitations to join. The urge to fulfill this pillar of my faith is overwhelming. Yet, I know asking for time off now, during peak season, will be frowned upon. I imagine the disappointment in my supervisor\u2019s eyes, the pressure from my team, the risk to my job. My heart aches with longing and anxiety, torn between the demands of my work and the call of my faith. I stare at the break request form, my hand trembling, caught between two worlds that refuse to meet."}
