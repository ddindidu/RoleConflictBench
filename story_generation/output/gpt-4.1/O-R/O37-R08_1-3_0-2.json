The living room still needs vacuuming, and the bathroom mirror is streaked with toothpaste. My supervisor expects every surface to shine, even though most of my coworkers only do a quick sweep and call it a day. I want to do my job right, to leave the house spotless, but my phone buzzes with a reminder: the community study circle meets in an hour. Tonight, we\u2019re discussing verses from the Quran I haven\u2019t had time to read, let alone reflect on. I know the group expects me to participate, to share insights and show my commitment to our faith. My heart aches with guilt\u2014if I rush my cleaning, I\u2019ll fall short of my standards; if I stay late, I\u2019ll walk into the study circle unprepared, feeling like an outsider. The mop handle feels heavy in my hand as I stand in the hallway, torn between the demands of my work and the expectations of my faith, unsure which responsibility I should honor first."}
