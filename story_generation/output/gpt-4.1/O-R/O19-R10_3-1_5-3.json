As a pharmacist, I knew how crucial it was to catch any dangerous interactions, and she trusted me to guide her safely. My mind was focused, listening to her concerns, when I noticed a man quietly slip ahead of an elderly woman in the waiting line. It was subtle, but clear. My upbringing as a Hindu echoed in my mind\u2014dharma, the duty to uphold fairness and kindness, even in small moments. I felt a tug inside, a responsibility to speak up for what was right. But Mrs. Patel\u2019s questions grew more urgent, and I could see her anxiety. My professional role demanded my full attention, yet my conscience whispered that ignoring the unfairness was wrong. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt my heart race, torn between the patient in front of me and the principle I lived by."}
