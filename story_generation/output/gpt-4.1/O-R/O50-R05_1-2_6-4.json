It\u2019s a new client, her voice tentative as she asks for a few basic tips on the machine I serviced last week. I can hear the uncertainty in her tone, the expectation that I\u2019ll guide her through the first steps, make her feel confident in her work. I glance at the clock\u2014fifteen minutes until the children arrive, eager faces expecting stories and lessons, the weekly rhythm of their Jewish learning. My mind races. As a machine repairer, I know how important it is to support clients, to be patient and thorough, especially with someone new. But as a rabbi, I feel the weight of my responsibility to the children, to their parents, to the tradition I\u2019m entrusted to pass on. The phone feels heavy in my hand. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and both roles are calling me, each with its own urgency. My heart pounds as I stand at the crossroads, torn between the needs of my client and the expectations of my community."}
