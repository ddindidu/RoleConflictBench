My headset pressed against my ears, the hum of the call center blending with the low anxiety in my chest. The automated compliance system tracked every second, and I knew if I logged off even a minute early, I\u2019d get flagged\u2014again. But tonight was the temple\u2019s evening chant, a ritual I\u2019d promised myself never to miss. The community would be gathering, incense curling through the air, voices rising in unison. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be present, to help set up cushions, to join the circle and let go of worldly concerns. Yet here I was, tethered to my desk, the demands of my job pulling me one way, my spiritual commitments pulling me another. My supervisor\u2019s warning from last week echoed in my mind, but so did the gentle reminder from my teacher: \u201cPractice is not just for when it\u2019s easy.\u201d My hand hovered over the log-off button, heart pounding, caught between the rigid schedule of my work and the quiet call of the temple bell."}
