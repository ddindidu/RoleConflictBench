It was a standard service agreement, nothing urgent, but I knew my reputation depended on thoroughness. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the family puja was in two hours. As a Hindu, attending these ceremonies wasn\u2019t just tradition\u2014it was a duty, a way to honor my family and faith. My mother had called twice already, reminding me to wear the new kurta she\u2019d bought and not to be late. I glanced at the contract again, feeling the weight of my professional responsibility. If I left now, I\u2019d have to rush through the review later, risking mistakes. But if I stayed, I\u2019d disappoint my family and miss the rituals that meant so much to us. My mind raced, torn between the silent expectations of my client and the spoken hopes of my family. The clock ticked on, and I felt the pressure mounting, caught between two worlds that both demanded my best."}
