My mind wandered to the small brass lamp waiting for me at home, the one I light every evening as part of my daily puja. It was almost time, and I could already picture the gentle glow, the scent of incense curling in the air. But as I tallied the cash, I noticed a small discrepancy\u2014just a few rupees off, nothing that would affect the total sales, but still, a deviation from the store\u2019s strict policy. My manager expected me to report every irregularity, no matter how minor. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure of time. If I delayed, I\u2019d miss the auspicious window for my prayers, breaking a ritual that grounds me in my faith. My hands trembled slightly as I weighed the expectations: the duty to my job, to follow every procedure, and the duty to my beliefs, to honor the daily rituals that connect me to something greater. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding my loyalty, and I stood there, caught between the register and the lamp, unsure which call to answer first."}
