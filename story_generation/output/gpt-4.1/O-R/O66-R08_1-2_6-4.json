As a taxi driver, I took pride in keeping my cab spotless\u2014customers expected a clean, professional ride, and I wanted to deliver nothing less. Today, though, my mind kept drifting to the office function scheduled for the afternoon. It was a rare event, with colleagues from all departments, men and women alike, and the company had sent out a reminder: \u201cDress smart, look your best!\u201d\n\nI stared at my reflection in the rearview mirror, my modest attire\u2014long sleeves, loose trousers, and a headscarf\u2014neatly in place. As a Muslim, dressing modestly wasn\u2019t just a choice; it was a commitment to my faith. But I knew the unspoken expectations at work: sharp suits, stylish dresses, a polished look that often clashed with my usual clothing. Would my appearance seem out of place, too plain, not \u201cprofessional\u201d enough for the occasion? The pressure to fit in tugged at me, but so did my desire to stay true to my beliefs. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I wondered how I could meet both demands without letting either side down."}
