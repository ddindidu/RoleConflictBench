The project deadline looms, and every minute counts. As the lead architect, everyone looks to me to resolve disputes, keep the schedule tight, and deliver results. My phone buzzes\u2014a reminder from my mother about the Hajj registration deadline. I close my eyes, picturing the Kaaba, the crowds of pilgrims, the peace I\u2019ve always imagined feeling there. But the cost is steep, and I\u2019m still early in my career, barely managing rent and student loans. My family expects me to fulfill this pillar of faith soon, just as my colleagues expect me to be present, focused, and unwavering. The weight of both worlds presses on my chest. I want to honor my faith, to stand with millions in prayer, but I also can\u2019t let my team down or risk my future in architecture. My mind races, torn between the sacred journey I long for and the professional path I\u2019ve worked so hard to build."}
