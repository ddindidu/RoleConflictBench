The peace was almost tangible, and I felt my heart settle as I prepared for an afternoon of quiet reflection. My mind was just beginning to drift into prayer when my police radio, tucked discreetly in my bag, crackled to life. \u201cAll units, armed robbery in progress at Main and 5th. Immediate response needed.\u201d My breath caught. I was off duty, but I was still a police officer. I could already picture the chaos\u2014innocent people in danger, the law being broken, and my training urging me to act.\n\nBut here, in the silence of the convent, I was Sister Maria, expected to devote myself to spiritual study, to model peace and trust in God\u2019s providence. The sisters relied on me to be present, calm, and focused on our shared faith. Yet the badge in my wallet felt heavy, a reminder of my oath to protect and serve. My hands trembled as I weighed the demands of both worlds, torn between the call to action and the call to contemplation, knowing that whatever I chose, a part of me would be left behind."}
