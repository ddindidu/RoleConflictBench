Swim lessons were starting in less than an hour, and if I didn\u2019t fix it, the class would be a mess. As a lifeguard, I knew it was my job to keep everything in order, to make sure the equipment was safe and ready. I knelt down, already planning how to repair it, when I saw Mrs. Carter sitting alone on the bleachers, her shoulders hunched, eyes red. She was a regular at my church, and lately, she\u2019d seemed weighed down by something she wouldn\u2019t name. As her pastor, I felt a deep responsibility to offer her comfort, to be present and listen. But the minutes ticked by, and I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014fix the rope or sit with Mrs. Carter? Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt torn, heart pounding, caught between the urgent and the important, not sure which part of me should take the lead."}
