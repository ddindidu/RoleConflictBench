I scan groceries, smile, and wish each customer a good day, just as I\u2019m expected to. My manager always says, \u201cFriendly service keeps them coming back.\u201d As a cashier, I know my job is to be patient and pleasant, even when the line snakes past the bakery. \n\nBut then, a woman steps up, her eyes darting nervously. She slides a few items onto the belt, and I notice a small, expensive bottle tucked under her purse. She hasn\u2019t scanned it. My heart pounds. As a Christian, I\u2019m taught to be honest, to do what\u2019s right, and not to turn a blind eye to wrongdoing. But I also know that calling her out could embarrass her, maybe even cost her more than she can afford. The line behind her grows, and I feel the weight of everyone\u2019s impatience. I\u2019m torn between my duty to my job\u2014friendly, efficient service\u2014and my deeper commitment to my faith\u2019s moral code. My hands tremble as I reach for the next item, caught between two worlds, unsure which voice to follow."}
