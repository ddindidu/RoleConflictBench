My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the project manager, reminding me that the stakeholders needed a working demo by tomorrow. The pressure was mounting; this prototype was crucial for the team\u2019s future, and everyone was counting on me to deliver. But then, another message came through, this time from a member of my congregation. There had been a sudden accident in town, and several families were in shock, needing comfort and guidance. As their pastor, I was expected to be present, to listen, to pray with them, to help them find hope in the chaos. My mind raced, torn between the urgent technical demands of my engineering team and the emotional needs of my community. Both roles needed me now, both with expectations I couldn\u2019t ignore. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I wrestled with the impossible choice before me."}
