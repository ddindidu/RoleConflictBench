The line stretched past the candy racks, customers shifting impatiently, some glancing at their watches. My manager\u2019s eyes flicked over, silently urging me to keep the line moving, to avoid mistakes, to be the reliable cashier they expected. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the mosque committee. The imam scheduled for the special remembrance hadn\u2019t arrived, and the congregation was waiting. Only I was authorized to lead the prayer. I pictured the crowd, their trust in me as their spiritual guide, their need for comfort and guidance. My heart pounded, torn between the duty to my customers and my responsibility to my community. Each beep of the scanner felt heavier, each minute ticking by a reminder that I was needed in two places at once, both expecting my full presence, both unable to wait."}
