It was a quiet Sunday morning, the kind that usually meant a slow start at the station. My hands moved automatically, but my mind wandered. I thought about the church bells that would soon ring, calling everyone to worship. I hadn\u2019t been to Sunday service in weeks\u2014every time I planned to go, a call would come in, or I\u2019d be asked to cover another shift. My pastor always said that worship was a priority, a time to gather and strengthen our faith. But here, in this ambulance, I was needed too. The city expected me to be ready, to provide care at a moment\u2019s notice. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to my patients, and my longing to be with my church family. As I closed the kit, I heard the distant sound of sirens and wondered, if the call came now, what would I choose?"}
