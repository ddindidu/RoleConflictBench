My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cEvery check, every time. Safety and punctuality come first.\u201d I know the routine\u2014inspect the non-critical systems, sign off, and keep the train on schedule. Commuters depend on me, and I take pride in never letting them down.\n\nBut today, my thoughts drift to Mecca. The doctor\u2019s voice was gentle but firm: \u201cIf you want to perform Hajj, it must be this year. Your health won\u2019t allow another chance.\u201d My heart aches with longing. As a Muslim, the pilgrimage is a sacred duty, a once-in-a-lifetime journey I\u2019ve dreamed of since childhood. My family\u2019s eyes were bright with hope when we discussed it last night.\n\nNow, the weight of both worlds presses on me. The train\u2019s departure time looms, and my duty to the city is clear. Yet, the call to fulfill my faith is stronger than ever. I grip the clipboard tighter, torn between the expectations of my profession and the demands of my soul, uncertain which path I will choose."}
