The plant\u2019s safety compliance was in question, and if I didn\u2019t address the flagged issues by the end of the day, operations would grind to a halt. My team was already stretched thin, and everyone was looking to me for direction. I could almost feel the weight of their expectations pressing on my shoulders\u2014lives and livelihoods depended on my technical judgment and swift action.\n\nBut my phone buzzed, and I saw the reminder: a counseling appointment with Mrs. Ramirez, a longtime member of my congregation. She\u2019d confided in me last Sunday about her ongoing struggle with depression, and I\u2019d promised to be there for her today. She needed spiritual guidance, someone to listen and offer hope. I knew how much she was counting on me, and the thought of letting her down gnawed at my conscience.\n\nCaught between the urgent demands of my engineering role and the sacred trust of my priestly calling, I felt my chest tighten. Both worlds needed me\u2014right now. I closed my eyes, torn, the clock ticking louder in my mind."}
