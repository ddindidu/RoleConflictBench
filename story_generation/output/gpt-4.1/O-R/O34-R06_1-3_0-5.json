The radar screen is almost empty, just a few blips gliding through the darkness. I lean back, savoring the calm, but my mind drifts to the church service starting in less than an hour. I promised Pastor Lee I\u2019d help set up for the breakfast, and I know how much the community counts on me to be there, to pray together, to serve. But the schedule changed last minute\u2014someone called in sick, and now I\u2019m the only controller on duty until the next shift arrives. \n\nI glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The expectation to keep the airspace safe, to be vigilant even when it\u2019s quiet, is absolute. But my heart aches at the thought of missing worship, of letting down my church family. I can almost hear the hymns, smell the coffee brewing in the fellowship hall. My hands hover over the radio, my mind torn between duty and devotion, each role demanding my presence, neither willing to let go."}
