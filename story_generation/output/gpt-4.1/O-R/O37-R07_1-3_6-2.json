Today was the monastery\u2019s annual festival, a day I cherished as a Buddhist, when the community gathered for rituals and shared meals. I had promised to help with the preparations, to sweep the temple grounds and arrange offerings before the first chant. But as a housekeeping cleaner, I was also scheduled for a deep clean at the hospital, a task that required strict adherence to safety and hygiene protocols. I knew I should wear gloves for every task, but sometimes, in the rush, I skipped them for smaller jobs. My supervisor had warned me: \u201cNo shortcuts, not even once.\u201d The hospital was short-staffed, and my absence would be noticed. Yet, the monks were counting on me too, and my heart ached at the thought of missing the festival\u2019s opening prayers. I stood in my small kitchen, torn between the expectations of my work and my faith, feeling the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders."}
