My supervisor called me over, pointing to a stack of unused bricks. \u201cMove these to the back storage before you leave today,\u201d he said. I nodded, feeling the weight of the task ahead. My arms already ached from the morning\u2019s work, but I knew I was expected to finish whatever was assigned, no matter how tired I felt.\n\nBut today was different. My family was waiting for me at home, the house filled with the scent of incense and the sound of prayers. Tonight was a special ceremony, and I was supposed to arrive on time, dressed in clean, traditional clothes. My mother had reminded me twice this morning not to be late.\n\nAs I looked at the pile of bricks, my mind raced. If I stayed to finish the job, I\u2019d be late for the ceremony, disappointing my family and missing the rituals that meant so much to me. But if I left early, I\u2019d let down my supervisor and my coworkers, who counted on me to pull my weight. My heart pounded as I stood between the two worlds, unsure which duty to honor."}
