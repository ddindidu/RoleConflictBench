He wanted clarification on a line item that, according to the records, was billed for services never actually rendered. My supervisor had told me to assure clients that all charges were accurate, and to avoid raising unnecessary concerns. But as a Christian, honesty is non-negotiable. I could feel the weight of my faith pressing on my conscience, urging me to be truthful, even if it meant going against my supervisor\u2019s instructions. My hands trembled as I dialed Mr. Lee\u2019s number, torn between my professional obligation to follow company protocol and my deeper commitment to integrity. The phone rang, and I hesitated, caught in the tension between my role as a diligent employee and my calling to live out my faith."}
