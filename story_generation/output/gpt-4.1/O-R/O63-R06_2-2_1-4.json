The phone rang, and I launched into my pitch, but as usual, the prospect interrupted with a barrage of technical questions. My script only skimmed the surface, and I felt the familiar anxiety rise\u2014my supervisor expected me to handle objections smoothly, to keep the call moving, to close the sale. I glanced at the clock. It was nearly time for Wednesday evening church service, something I\u2019d promised myself and my faith community I would never miss. The pastor always said our presence mattered, that worship and fellowship were not just obligations but lifelines. Yet, the call queue was long, and my manager had made it clear that leaving early was frowned upon, especially during a new campaign. My heart pounded as I tried to answer the customer\u2019s questions, torn between the demands of my job and the pull of my faith.
