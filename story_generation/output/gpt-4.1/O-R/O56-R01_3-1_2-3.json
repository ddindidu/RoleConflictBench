I smiled warmly, ushering them to their seats, offering tea, and assuring them everything would run smoothly. My hands moved quickly, curling and pinning, but my mind kept drifting. Just before they arrived, I\u2019d received a message that Mrs. Carter, a longtime member of my congregation, was having a rough morning. She\u2019d lost her husband last year, and I\u2019d promised to check in on her whenever I could. I glanced at my phone, feeling the weight of her loneliness pressing on my heart. The bride\u2019s mother asked for reassurance about the schedule, and I nodded, but inside, I was torn. My clients needed my full attention and calm presence, but so did Mrs. Carter, who might be waiting for a comforting word. The expectations of both my worlds pressed in, and I felt the ache of wanting to be in two places at once, knowing I could only choose one in this moment."}
