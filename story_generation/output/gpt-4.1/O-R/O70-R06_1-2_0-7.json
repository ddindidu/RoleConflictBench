It was supposed to be delivered by 6:30, but traffic and a late pickup had thrown off my schedule. My phone buzzed with a message from my friend, Sarah. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and tonight she finally reached out, asking if I could come over. I knew she needed someone to listen, to pray with her, to just be there. But my job demanded I finish my route, and the company tracked every delivery. If I stopped to see Sarah, the package would be even later, and I risked a warning from my supervisor. If I delivered the package first, I might miss the chance to be there for her when she needed me most. My heart pounded as I sat at the intersection, torn between the expectations of my job and the call to show love and kindness. I gripped the steering wheel, wrestling with what to do next."}
