My job as a telemarketer is straightforward\u2014answer questions, handle objections, keep my voice warm and inviting. Most callers are polite, sometimes curious, and the script covers nearly everything they ask. But today, my mind drifts. The Mother Superior has just asked me to lead daily reflections for the retreat next week. It\u2019s an honor, but also a heavy responsibility. I\u2019m expected to guide my sisters in spiritual study, to be present, thoughtful, and prepared. Yet here I am, fielding calls, reciting lines about insurance plans, my heart tugged in another direction. Each ring of the phone pulls me away from the quiet I crave for prayer and reflection. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding patience and persuasion, the other, contemplation and spiritual leadership. My hands tremble as I answer the next call, torn between the expectations of my work and my calling, unsure how I can possibly meet both."}
