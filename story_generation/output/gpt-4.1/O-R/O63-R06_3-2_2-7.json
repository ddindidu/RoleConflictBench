I\u2019ve been loyal for years, and now you\u2019re trying to trick me?\u201d His voice trembled with anger and disappointment. As a telemarketer, I was trained to handle objections, to keep my tone steady, to defend the legitimacy of our promotions. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t let them rattle you. Stick to the script. Close the deal.\u201d\n\nBut as a Christian, I felt a different pull. I remembered the teachings of Jesus\u2014show love, be patient, offer understanding. I knew Mr. Harris had recently lost his wife; I\u2019d seen the note in his file. My heart ached to respond with compassion, to set aside the sales pitch and simply listen, to offer a kind word instead of a rebuttal.\n\nCaught between the demands of my job and the call to kindness, I felt my chest tighten. My mind raced, torn between the script in front of me and the quiet voice urging me to care for a hurting soul."}
