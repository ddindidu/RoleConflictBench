My headset itched against my ear as I listened to a customer\u2019s polite refusal, my mind already drifting to the mosque. Today was Friday, and as the imam, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah at noon. The congregation would be gathering soon, waiting for my words, my guidance. But the automated compliance system at work was merciless; any unscheduled minute away from my desk would be flagged, and I\u2019d already been warned about my adherence to break times. \n\nI glanced at my phone. The guest speaker I\u2019d invited was ready, sermon in hand, but I knew the community expected me to lead. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cNo exceptions, not even for prayer.\u201d My heart pounded as I weighed the risk of disciplinary action against the disappointment of my congregation.
