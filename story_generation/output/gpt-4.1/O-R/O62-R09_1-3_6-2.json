It was a busy Sunday, and I noticed a group of kids slipping into the shallow end without an adult. My supervisor had been clear: no unsupervised swimming, ever. I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014one accident, and it would be on me. But my phone buzzed with a message from my son: \u201cCan you help me with my Torah portion? I\u2019m stuck.\u201d His bar mitzvah was only weeks away, and he was struggling. As a Jewish parent, I was supposed to guide him, teach him the prayers, the melodies, the meaning behind the words. I could picture him at home, frustrated and anxious, waiting for me. My heart twisted. I was needed in two places at once\u2014one role demanding vigilance and authority, the other calling for patience and tradition. I gripped the whistle tighter, torn between the pool\u2019s edge and my son\u2019s voice, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
