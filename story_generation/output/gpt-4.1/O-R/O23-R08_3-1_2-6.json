My client depended on me to catch every nuance, every hidden risk\u2014especially now, with a clause that could cost them dearly if I missed it. The pressure was immense; my reputation and their future were on the line. Yet, as I read, my phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cHave you thought about Hajj this year? You know how important it is.\u201d My heart tightened. As a Muslim, performing Hajj is a sacred duty, one I\u2019d promised myself I would fulfill as soon as I could. But the reality was harsh\u2014I was still early in my career, barely making enough to cover my expenses, let alone save for the pilgrimage. The weight of my professional responsibility pressed against the spiritual longing and familial expectation. I felt torn, caught between the urgent demands of my job and the deep, persistent call of my faith. My mind raced, searching for a way to honor both, but the answer eluded me as I stared at the contract, my conscience heavy with indecision."}
