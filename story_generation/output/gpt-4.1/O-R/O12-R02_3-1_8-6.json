The production outage was worse than I\u2019d feared\u2014users were locked out, and the error logs pointed straight to a function I\u2019d written last week. My team was pinging me for a fix, and the customer support lead was escalating the issue. At the same time, I glanced at the church calendar: the committee would be gathering in less than an hour, expecting me to guide the discussion and set the tone for the new season. I could picture the faces of the adults eager for spiritual growth, the trust they placed in me as their priest. But I also felt the weight of my team\u2019s reliance, the customers\u2019 frustration, and the knowledge that my code had let them down. My heart pounded as I stared at my laptop, torn between the urgent call to serve my congregation and the equally pressing responsibility to restore the service. Both roles demanded my full presence, and I felt myself pulled apart by the impossible choice."}
