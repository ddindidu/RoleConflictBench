She held out her grandson\u2019s toy, its wheels dangling by a thread. \u201cCan you fix it before Shabbat?\u201d she pleaded. I examined the damage, already calculating the time and materials needed, and promised to prepare a quote. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the children\u2019s Torah class I was scheduled to teach in less than an hour. The synagogue expected me to be there early, to greet the children and set the tone for the lesson. My mind raced: if I focused on the toy, I\u2019d be late for class, disappointing the families who rely on me for guidance. But if I left the toy, I\u2019d let down Mrs. Feldman and her grandson, who trusted me to restore something precious. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each representing a different kind of promise. I stood in my workshop, torn, the scent of sawdust mingling with the echo of sacred words, unsure which path to take."}
