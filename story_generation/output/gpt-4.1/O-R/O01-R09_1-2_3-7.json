The renovation needed to be simple\u2014just enough to make the space more functional for my work. My mind raced with ideas: where to place the desk, how to maximize the light, how to keep the lines clean and the flow natural. I wanted it to be perfect, even if it was just for me. \n\nBut as I sketched, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was scheduled to chant Torah at synagogue tonight. It wasn\u2019t just any service; I\u2019d promised weeks ago, and people were counting on me. My community expected me to be there, to uphold tradition, to lend my voice. Yet, the plans for my studio felt urgent, the ideas slipping away the longer I delayed. \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my commitment to my craft, the need to create, and my responsibility to my faith, my community. My hands trembled slightly, torn between the lines on the page and the words I needed to prepare. I stared at the unfinished sketch, heart pounding, caught between two parts of myself."}
