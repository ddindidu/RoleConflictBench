Just then, Mrs. Carter stormed in front of my mirror, her voice sharp and trembling. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I asked for!\u201d she cried, running her fingers through her uneven bangs. I could feel the eyes of my coworkers on me, expecting me to soothe her, fix the cut, and keep the peace. My mind raced with apologies and solutions, but before I could respond, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mark, a member of my congregation. \u201cCan you talk? I need guidance. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I knew he\u2019d been struggling with a major decision, and as his pastor, he was counting on me for comfort and wisdom. My heart pounded as I looked from Mrs. Carter\u2019s tearful reflection to the glowing screen in my hand. Both needed me\u2014one demanding immediate professional care, the other seeking spiritual support. I felt torn, the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
