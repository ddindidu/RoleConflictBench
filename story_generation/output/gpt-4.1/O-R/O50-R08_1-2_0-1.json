My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need it running smoothly, even if it\u2019s not used much. Find the problem.\u201d I knelt beside the machine, tools in hand, tracing wires and checking sensors, but the issue was elusive, appearing only when I thought I\u2019d fixed it. The pressure to diagnose and resolve it before the next shift weighed on me.\n\nYet, as I glanced at my phone, I saw the time\u2014Maghrib was approaching. It was Ramadan\u2019s midpoint, and I was already behind on my daily Quran reading. I\u2019d promised myself to catch up tonight, to recite and reflect, to feel the peace and connection I craved. But the machine demanded my focus, and the expectation to be a diligent repairer clashed with my spiritual commitment. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to my work, and the duty to my faith. I felt the tension coil inside me, unsure which role to serve first as the minutes slipped away."}
