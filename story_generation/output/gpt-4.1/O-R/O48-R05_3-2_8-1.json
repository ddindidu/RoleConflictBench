As a nursing assistant, I knew my place was by her side, offering comfort and a listening ear. She had just received news that her cancer had returned, and she clung to my hand earlier, whispering fears she couldn\u2019t share with her family. I wanted to stay, to be the steady presence she needed in this moment of despair.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: Shabbat was only hours away. As the community\u2019s rabbi, I was expected to deliver a sermon that would inspire and uplift, to be present and prepared for the congregation that looked to me for spiritual guidance. I hadn\u2019t finished my message, and the weight of expectation pressed on my shoulders. I could almost hear the voices of my congregants, waiting for words of hope and wisdom.\n\nTorn between the bedside and the bimah, I felt the demands of both worlds pulling me apart. My heart ached with the knowledge that I could not be fully present in both places at once."}
