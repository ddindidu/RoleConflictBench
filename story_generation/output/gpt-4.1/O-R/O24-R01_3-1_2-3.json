As a judge, I knew the law demanded my full attention\u2014every detail in these documents could change a life, and I had less than an hour to make a ruling. My phone buzzed with a message from the church secretary: \u201cMrs. Evans is struggling again. She\u2019s alone and could use a call.\u201d As her pastor, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and a listening ear, especially in moments like these. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. The law required my impartiality and focus, but my faith called me to compassion and presence. My mind raced, torn between the urgency of justice and the quiet need for kindness. I stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which duty to answer first."}
