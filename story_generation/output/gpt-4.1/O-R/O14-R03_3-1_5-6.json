My research findings, months in the making, needed to be documented and reported with precision\u2014every dataset checked, every conclusion justified. The editor\u2019s email flashed in my mind: \u201cFinal report due by midnight.\u201d Yet, as I glanced at the simple wooden cross on my desk, I remembered my commitment as a nun. This afternoon was meant for spiritual study, a rare quiet stretch set aside for reading scripture and silent reflection. The convent expected my presence in the chapel, my heart and mind open to God, not tangled in scientific data. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to truth and knowledge, and my vow to spiritual devotion. My hands trembled as I hovered between my laptop and my worn Bible, torn by the impossible demand to be wholly present in both realms at once."}
