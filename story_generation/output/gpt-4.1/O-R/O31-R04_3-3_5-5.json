Civilians at risk.\u201d My heart pounded. As a police officer, I knew what was expected: protect the innocent, act fast, prevent harm. But outside the prayer hall, the congregation was gathering\u2014hundreds of faces, some from distant towns, waiting for my words. Today\u2019s sermon marked a milestone for our community, and as their imam, I was the one they trusted to guide and inspire them. I could already hear the hum of anticipation, the weight of their hopes pressing on me. My badge felt heavy in my pocket, my Quran heavier in my hands. I stared at the door, torn between the urgent call to duty and the sacred trust of my congregation. The seconds ticked by, each one stretching the conflict inside me tighter. I closed my eyes, feeling the impossible pull of both uniforms I wore, knowing that whatever I chose, a part of me would be left behind."}
