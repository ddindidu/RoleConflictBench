The foreman\u2019s voice echoes, \u201cEveryone to the muster point, now!\u201d I know the drill\u2014no exceptions, no delays. As I hurry toward the exit, I spot the snack table set up for the crew, a gesture meant to keep us calm during the evacuation. My stomach growls; I haven\u2019t eaten since dawn. The others grab whatever\u2019s there\u2014sandwiches, chips, cookies. I scan the table, searching for the kosher snacks I brought from home, but in the rush, they\u2019re nowhere in sight. The expectation is clear: I\u2019m supposed to stick with the team, follow orders, and not hold anyone up. But my faith demands I only eat what\u2019s kosher, and I can\u2019t just ignore that. My coworkers are already urging me to grab something and move along. I feel the weight of their eyes, the pressure to fit in, to be part of the team, but inside, I\u2019m torn\u2014caught between the rules of the site and the rules of my faith, unsure which to honor in this moment."}
