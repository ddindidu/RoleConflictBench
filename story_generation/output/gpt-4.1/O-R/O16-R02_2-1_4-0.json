My patient, Mrs. Lee, sat across from me, her eyes wide with worry as she clutched the pamphlet about her new diagnosis. She had so many questions\u2014about medications, lifestyle changes, what the future might hold. I could see how much she needed reassurance, someone to listen and guide her through the uncertainty. As a doctor, I knew it was my duty to be present, to answer every question with patience and empathy.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the daily prayer service at the chapel was about to begin. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, offer comfort, and be a spiritual anchor for those who gathered. Even though the service was routine and optional, I knew some parishioners relied on that moment of connection, especially those who felt lost or alone.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my full attention. My heart raced as I tried to decide where I was needed most, torn between my patient\u2019s anxious gaze and the silent call of the chapel."}
