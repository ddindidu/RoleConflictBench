My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need every call to count, or we all lose out.\u201d I dialed number after number, my pitch polished and persistent, but my heart wasn\u2019t in it. Just as I was about to make another call, my phone vibrated with a message from a church member. She was in tears, her family falling apart, and she needed to talk\u2014now. As her pastor, I was expected to listen, to offer comfort and hope, to be present in her pain. But as a telemarketer, I was expected to keep dialing, to close deals, to not let the team down. My hands trembled as I stared at the phone, torn between the desperate need of a soul and the relentless pressure of the sales floor. The weight of both worlds pressed in, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between compassion and quotas."}
