My break was scheduled for another hour, but my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Ramirez, a member of my congregation. She was waiting in the church office, desperate for guidance about her son\u2019s troubles. I\u2019d promised her this time weeks ago, knowing how much she needed someone to listen. But here, in the world of telemarketing, the automated system watched every second. If I left my desk now, even for a few minutes, the system would flag me for unscheduled downtime. I\u2019d already been warned twice this month. My supervisor\u2019s expectations were clear: no exceptions, no excuses. Yet, as a priest, I was expected to be present, compassionate, and available, especially in moments of crisis. My heart pounded as I stared at the blinking cursor, torn between the rigid demands of my job and the sacred trust of my calling. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt myself caught in a silent, impossible tug-of-war."}
