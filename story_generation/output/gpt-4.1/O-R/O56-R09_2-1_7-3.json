She smiled apologetically, mentioning she\u2019d rushed over and hadn\u2019t had time to shower. As a hairdresser, I knew I needed to wash and condition her hair before starting the cut\u2014clean hair is essential for a good result. I led her to the sink, my mind already on the steps ahead.\n\nBut as I reached for the shampoo, my stomach rumbled. I hadn\u2019t eaten since breakfast, and the familiar ache reminded me of my commitment to keep kosher. I\u2019d brought snacks from home, all carefully checked and prepared, but the break room was full of non-kosher food from a coworker\u2019s birthday. The smell drifted into the salon, making my hunger sharper.\n\nI felt the tug between my roles: the expectation to give my client the best service, and the discipline of my faith, which meant waiting until I could eat something kosher. My hands moved automatically through the motions of washing her hair, but inside, I wrestled with the discomfort\u2014torn between my professional standards and the demands of my tradition, unsure which need I should answer first."}
