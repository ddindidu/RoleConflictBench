It was almost sunset, the time I always set aside to light the lamp and offer prayers at my home altar. My mother\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo matter how busy you are, never miss your evening puja.\u201d But just as I was about to leave for home, my phone buzzed with a message from a customer. Their package was delayed, and they wanted an update\u2014immediately. As a delivery person, I knew I had to respond politely and professionally, even though I was frustrated by the misplaced parcel and the pressure from my supervisor to resolve it quickly. My fingers hovered over the screen, torn between typing a reassuring message and rushing home to keep my religious commitment. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt my chest tighten as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
