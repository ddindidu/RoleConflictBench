As a scientist, I knew the importance of accuracy\u2014my supervisor expected a clear, honest summary of our findings, even if the results were inconclusive. The pressure to present well, to be taken seriously, weighed on me. At the same time, I glanced at the clock, remembering the office function scheduled for this afternoon. It was a casual event, and my colleagues often dressed informally, but as a Muslim, I felt the responsibility to dress modestly, covering my arms and legs, and wearing my hijab. I could already imagine the curious glances, the subtle questions about my choice of clothing, and the unspoken expectation to blend in. The thought of standing out, of being seen as different, made my stomach twist. I wanted to be respected for my work, not my appearance, but I also didn\u2019t want to compromise my beliefs. As the meeting time approached, I found myself torn, wrestling with the demands of my profession and my faith, unsure how to navigate the expectations pressing in from both sides."}
