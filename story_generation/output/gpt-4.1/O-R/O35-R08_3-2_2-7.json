Suddenly, a red alert flashed: brake system malfunction. My heart pounded. Protocol demanded I report it immediately and stop the train, no matter the delay or inconvenience to passengers. Safety was everything. But as I reached for the radio, my mind drifted to the envelope of savings tucked away at home\u2014money I\u2019d set aside for Hajj. This year, my friends were going, and I\u2019d planned to join them. The pilgrimage was a sacred duty, a dream I\u2019d nurtured for years. But a major incident on my record could mean suspension, or worse, losing my job. Without this job, the Hajj would slip from my grasp, maybe forever. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the responsibility to protect lives now, and the longing to fulfill my faith. My hand hovered over the radio, torn between duty and devotion, as the train hurtled forward and the alert continued to blink."}
