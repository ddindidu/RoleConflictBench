The package in my hand was for Mrs. Goldstein, who always appreciated a friendly greeting and a few kind words. As a delivery person, I knew the importance of being polite and professional, especially with regular customers like her. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the weekly Torah class for the children at the synagogue was about to begin. As their rabbi, I was expected to be there on time, ready to teach and guide them in Jewish law. \n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. If I took the time to chat with Mrs. Goldstein, I\u2019d be late for the class, letting down the children and their parents who counted on my guidance. But if I rushed the delivery, I\u2019d fail to meet the standard of care and respect expected in my job. My heart pounded as I stood at her door, package in hand, torn between the demands of my two worlds."}
