The client\u2019s future hinged on my careful review\u2014if I missed a clause, they could face financial disaster. My phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was the community event, a rare gathering I\u2019d promised to attend. Arriving late, I found the buffet already picked over, the only food left unmarked and uncertified. My stomach tightened; I hadn\u2019t eaten all day, but keeping kosher wasn\u2019t just a preference\u2014it was a commitment, a piece of my identity. Colleagues urged me to eat, to relax, to join in. My client\u2019s emails kept pinging, demanding my attention. I felt the weight of expectation from both sides: the relentless precision of my legal work, the quiet discipline of my faith. My hands hovered over the food, my mind torn between hunger, duty, and belief, caught in the silent struggle of who I was supposed to be."}
