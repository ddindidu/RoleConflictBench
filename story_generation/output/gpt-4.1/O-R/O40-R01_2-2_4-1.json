The contractor had just called, reminding me that the kitchen needed to be ready by tomorrow morning. I could already hear the frustration in his voice if I missed the deadline. My mind raced through measurements and joinery, the pressure of collaboration with the electrician and plumber weighing on me. Just as I reached for my chisel, my phone buzzed. It was Sarah from church, her voice trembling. She needed to talk\u2014right now\u2014about a decision that could change her life. As her pastor, I knew she expected me to listen, to offer comfort and wisdom. But the clock was ticking, and the cabinetry wouldn\u2019t build itself. My heart pulled in two directions: the tangible demands of my craft, and the invisible, urgent needs of my flock. I stood in the middle of my workshop, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
