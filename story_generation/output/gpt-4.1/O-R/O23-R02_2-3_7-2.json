As a lawyer, I was bound by strict confidentiality; my client\u2019s files were sacred, not to be shared lightly. Yet, this morning, my firm\u2019s new assistant\u2014eager but inexperienced\u2014asked for access to those very files, claiming it would help streamline our workflow. I could see her frustration when I hesitated, but the rules were clear, and my conscience even clearer.\n\nBut as noon approached, my phone buzzed with reminders from the parish. Today was the most significant religious holiday of the year, and as the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers and offer guidance to hundreds who would gather, seeking comfort and hope. My absence would be noticed, perhaps even felt as a betrayal.\n\nI glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. The assistant waited outside my office, expecting an answer. The congregation waited at the church, expecting my presence. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the demands of both callings, torn between duty to my client and devotion to my faith community, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
