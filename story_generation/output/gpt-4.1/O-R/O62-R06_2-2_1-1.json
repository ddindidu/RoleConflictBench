As a lifeguard, I knew my job was to watch the swimmers without distraction, ready to leap in at the first sign of trouble. Suddenly, I noticed a commotion near the middle of the pool\u2014a swimmer was clearly struggling, their arms flailing. My muscles tensed, every instinct telling me to stay focused, to be ready.\n\nBut then, just behind me, I heard raised voices. Two teenagers were arguing, and one of them shouted a cruel insult that cut deep, echoing with hate. As a Christian, I felt a strong urge to intervene, to speak up for kindness and compassion, to remind them of the values I hold dear. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t do both\u2014if I turned away from the pool, even for a moment, I might miss a life-or-death moment. But if I ignored the cruelty, I\u2019d be turning my back on my faith. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, torn between my duty to protect and my calling to love."}
