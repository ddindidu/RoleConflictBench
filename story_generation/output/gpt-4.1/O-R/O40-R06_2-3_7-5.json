She\u2019d called me in a panic last night\u2014her grandson nearly tripped on a loose plank, and she was hosting a family gathering that afternoon. I could see the worry in her eyes when I promised I\u2019d fix it first thing today. My tools were ready, and the wood was stacked by the door.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. Church service would start in an hour. Pastor always said our presence mattered, that worship and fellowship were the foundation of our faith. I\u2019d missed last week\u2019s service for a late job, and Sister Ruth had gently reminded me how much the community valued my participation. I knew they expected me to be there, to sing, pray, and help set up for the luncheon afterward.\n\nStanding in my workshop, I felt torn. The deck needed urgent repair\u2014someone could get hurt if I delayed. But my church family counted on me, too. I gripped my hammer, wrestling with the weight of both promises, uncertain which path to take."}
