He slid into the back seat, mentioning he was just heading to a casual meet-up and wasn\u2019t in a rush. I nodded, but my mind was elsewhere. Tonight, my community\u2019s Quran study circle would gather, and I hadn\u2019t yet read the verses we\u2019d be discussing. As a Muslim, I felt the weight of expectation\u2014to come prepared, to reflect deeply, to honor the words of Allah. But as a taxi driver, I owed my passenger a safe, comfortable ride, and I couldn\u2019t simply ignore him or rush through the trip. My phone buzzed with a reminder about the study circle, and I felt a knot tighten in my chest. Should I try to listen to the Quran quietly as I drove, risking distraction? Or focus on my passenger, knowing I\u2019d arrive at the study circle unprepared? The conflicting demands pressed in on me, and I gripped the steering wheel, torn between my duties to my faith and my job."}
