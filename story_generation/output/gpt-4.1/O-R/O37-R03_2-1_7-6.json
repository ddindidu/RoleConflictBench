My shift as a housekeeping cleaner had just begun, and I noticed the new memo on the wall: stricter safety and hygiene protocols, no exceptions. I glanced at the cart\u2014gloves, mask, sanitizer, all lined up. I knew I should double-check every step, use the protective equipment, and clean with extra care. But today was also the one afternoon I had set aside for spiritual study, a rare quiet moment in the convent. My heart longed for the silence of my cell, the comfort of scripture, the gentle rhythm of prayer beads in my hands. Yet, the demands of my cleaning job pressed in, the expectation to be vigilant, thorough, and present. I felt torn, the weight of duty on one side and the pull of devotion on the other. My mind raced, caught between the world\u2019s need for cleanliness and my soul\u2019s need for reflection, unsure which voice to answer first."}
