The filing deadline was tomorrow, and my client was counting on me to catch any loopholes or hidden risks. As a lawyer, I knew the gravity of missing something\u2014my reputation and someone\u2019s livelihood were on the line. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: Sunday worship at church. I hadn\u2019t attended in weeks, always telling myself I\u2019d go when time allowed. My faith taught me to honor the Sabbath, to gather with others, to rest and reconnect with God. But the contracts wouldn\u2019t review themselves, and the clock was ticking. My heart ached with guilt\u2014toward my client if I left the work unfinished, toward my faith if I neglected worship again. I sat at my desk, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which expectation I would let down this time."}
