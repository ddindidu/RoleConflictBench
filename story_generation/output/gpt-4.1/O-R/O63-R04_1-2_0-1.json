Most callers today were polite, and their questions were easy\u2014answers I could recite in my sleep. My supervisor expected me to keep my numbers up, handle every objection, and never let a call go unanswered. But as the clock crept toward the afternoon prayer, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee: the backup imam was still out of town, and the congregation was gathering, waiting for me to lead them. My heart pounded. I glanced at the call queue, still full, and at the prayer schedule pinned to my monitor. The mosque expected me to be there, to guide the faithful, but my manager expected me to stay glued to my seat, headset on, voice steady. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each certain their need was greater. My hands trembled as I stared at the blinking cursor, torn between duty and duty, unsure which expectation I would let down."}
