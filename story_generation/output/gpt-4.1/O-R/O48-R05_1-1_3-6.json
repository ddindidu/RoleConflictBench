I glanced at the screen\u2014an email from a young couple, asking if I could officiate their wedding next summer. My mind raced. I needed to focus on Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s blood pressure, but the couple\u2019s message tugged at me. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to be present, attentive, and precise; every reading mattered for my patients\u2019 care. But as a rabbi, I was also expected to be responsive, compassionate, and available for life\u2019s most sacred moments. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. If I didn\u2019t reply soon, the couple might look elsewhere, but if I let my attention wander now, I could miss a critical change in Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s condition. My hands trembled slightly as I wrapped the cuff around her arm, my mind torn between the beep of the monitor and the chime of my inbox, wrestling with the impossible demands of being both healer and spiritual guide."}
