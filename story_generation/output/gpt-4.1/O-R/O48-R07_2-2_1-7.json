My patient, Mrs. Lee, is struggling to sit up in bed, her face pinched with pain after her surgery. I know she needs my help to get dressed and move safely, and I can\u2019t rush this\u2014her comfort and dignity depend on my patience and care. Yet, in the back of my mind, I hear the gentle reminder of my Buddhist study circle meeting tonight. We\u2019re supposed to discuss a chapter I haven\u2019t even read, and I promised myself I\u2019d be present, attentive, and prepared. The teachings say to be mindful and present in each moment, but right now, my mind is split. I feel the pull of duty to my patient, the expectation to be compassionate and thorough, and at the same time, the longing for spiritual growth and the commitment I made to my sangha. My heart aches with the tension, torn between the needs of another and the needs of my own spirit, unsure which path to follow as the evening shadows lengthen."}
