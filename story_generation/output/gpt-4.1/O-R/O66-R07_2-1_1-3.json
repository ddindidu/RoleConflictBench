The passenger in my backseat fidgets, eyes darting between his phone and the city outside. \u201cMy train leaves at 8:30,\u201d he says, voice tight. Traffic lights blink red ahead, and I feel the pressure mounting. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to get him to the station safely and on time. Every minute counts, and I know the shortcuts, the ways to shave seconds off the trip. But I also know my own plan: at 8:20, I\u2019d promised myself a quiet ten-minute window for mindfulness, a small island of peace in my chaotic day. The teachings say to be present, to breathe, to let go of rushing. But now, the city\u2019s demands and my passenger\u2019s urgency crash against my own need for stillness. My hands grip the wheel tighter. I can feel my heart racing, torn between the urge to speed through yellow lights and the call to slow down, to honor my practice. The city hums around me, and I sit at the crossroads of duty and devotion, unsure which road to take."}
