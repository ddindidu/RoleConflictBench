The customer in front of me was growing frustrated, insisting on returning a blender without a receipt. Store policy was clear\u2014no returns without proof of purchase. My manager expected me to stand firm, to follow the rules no matter how upset the customer became. But my mind kept drifting to the synagogue, where I was supposed to chant a Torah portion in less than an hour. It wasn\u2019t just any service; I had promised my rabbi and my family I would be there, and I knew how important it was to honor my commitment. The line behind the customer grew longer, and my phone buzzed with a reminder about the service. I felt torn in two, pulled by the demands of my job and the expectations of my faith. My hands trembled as I tried to explain the policy, all the while wrestling with the knowledge that every second spent here was a second lost from the sanctuary."}
