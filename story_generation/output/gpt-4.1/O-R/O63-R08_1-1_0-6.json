As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to handle every objection with a smile, to answer questions with the confidence my script provides. Most days, the calls are routine\u2014customers ask about payment plans or product details, and I respond smoothly, my words practiced and reassuring. But today, my mind drifts. My parents called last night, voices full of hope, reminding me that Hajj season is approaching. As a Muslim, I feel the weight of that expectation\u2014to perform the pilgrimage, to fulfill a pillar of my faith. Yet, I\u2019m early in my career, barely scraping by, my savings nowhere near enough for the journey. The phone rings again, and I force myself to focus, but the conflict gnaws at me. My job demands composure and focus, but my heart aches with longing and guilt. I wonder how long I can juggle these roles, feeling pulled between the demands of my faith and the reality of my work."}
