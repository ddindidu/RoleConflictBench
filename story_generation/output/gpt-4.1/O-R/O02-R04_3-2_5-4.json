As the lead engineer, I was responsible for addressing the safety concerns he\u2019d raised\u2014if I didn\u2019t act now, the plant could be shut down, and dozens of workers would be left in limbo. My phone buzzed with a reminder: Friday prayer was in two hours. I was the only imam scheduled, and the community had already shared the topic of my sermon. People would be coming from all over, expecting guidance and inspiration. My mind raced with the weight of both roles. If I stayed to resolve the safety issues, I\u2019d let down my congregation and disrupt a tradition that meant so much to them. If I left for the mosque, I\u2019d risk the safety of my team and the future of our operations. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt torn, unable to see a way to fulfill both duties without failing someone who depended on me."}
