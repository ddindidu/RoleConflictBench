I knew I should take time to counsel her properly, explain side effects, and check for interactions. But my mind was elsewhere\u2014my doctor had just told me that my health was declining, and if I wanted to fulfill my lifelong dream of performing Hajj, this year might be my last chance. As a Muslim, the pilgrimage is a sacred duty, and my family expects me to go. Yet, as a pharmacist, my patients rely on me for guidance and care. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders, torn between the immediate needs of those I serve and the spiritual obligation that may never come again. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on her question, but the conflict inside me grew stronger, leaving me suspended between duty and devotion, unsure which path to follow."}
