The foreman said it would help us work safer and more efficiently, and everyone on the crew was talking about how important it was to show commitment. As a construction laborer, I knew I was expected to be a team player, to show up and take every chance to improve. But the training was scheduled for the same afternoon I usually visit Mrs. Carter, the elderly woman who lives down the street. Every week, I bring her groceries and sit with her for a while, just talking and listening\u2014something I do because my faith teaches me to show love and kindness, especially to those who are lonely or in need.\n\nNow, I felt torn. If I skipped the training, would my coworkers think I wasn\u2019t dedicated? Would I be letting the team down? But if I missed my visit with Mrs. Carter, I\u2019d be turning my back on what I believe is right. The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I found myself wrestling with what to do, caught between being a good worker and a good Christian."}
