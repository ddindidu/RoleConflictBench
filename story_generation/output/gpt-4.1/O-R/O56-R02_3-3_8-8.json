The buildup was worse than I\u2019d expected, and every knot resisted my fingers, threatening to snap the comb or my patience. She needed a proper wash and deep conditioning before I could even think about cutting, but time was slipping away. My phone buzzed on the counter\u2014another reminder from the Martinez family. Their son\u2019s sacrament was tomorrow, and they needed me at the church for a final, crucial preparation session. As their priest, I was expected to guide them, to be present and attentive, especially now. But here, in the salon, Mrs. Kim expected my full focus and care, trusting me to restore her hair without pain or damage. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I rinsed the suds away, torn between the sacred and the everyday, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
