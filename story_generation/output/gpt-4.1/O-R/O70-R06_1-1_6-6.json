As a delivery person, I knew I had to be polite and professional, no matter what. I rang the bell, and the door swung open. The customer barely glanced at me, snatched the package, and muttered, \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d before turning away. My cheeks burned. I wanted to snap back, to defend myself\u2014traffic had been terrible, and I was only a few minutes behind. But then, the other part of me\u2014the Christian part\u2014reminded me of Jesus\u2019 teachings: show love, offer kindness, even when it\u2019s not returned. I felt the urge to say something gentle, maybe wish them a good day, or offer a smile. But the sting of their rudeness made it hard. I stood there, wrestling with the expectations of my job and my faith, unsure which voice to follow as the door closed in my face."}
