Her autoimmune disease was flaring again, and she needed a new round of immunosuppressants. The protocol was clear, but the timing was not. The pharmacy required my approval before noon, or she\u2019d have to wait another week for her medication. I glanced at the clock\u201411:15. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cJewish study with the kids, 11:30.\u201d Every week, I gathered my children to teach them about our traditions, the stories of our ancestors, the values that shaped us. They looked forward to it, and so did I. It was my promise to them, and to myself, to keep our heritage alive. But now, I felt torn. If I delayed the lesson, I\u2019d disappoint my children and break the rhythm we\u2019d built. If I postponed Miriam\u2019s prescription, her health could suffer. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014healer and teacher, doctor and parent, each demanding my full presence. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my heart caught between two worlds, unsure which duty to answer first."}
