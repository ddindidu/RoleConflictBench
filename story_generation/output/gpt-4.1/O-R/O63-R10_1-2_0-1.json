My shift as a telemarketer is usually smooth\u2014most callers are polite, and the script covers nearly every question. Still, I must stay alert, ready to handle objections with patience and charm. But as the clock ticks closer to sunset, my mind drifts to the small altar at home. As a Hindu, I am expected to light the lamp and offer prayers at this time, a ritual that brings peace and connection to my day. My supervisor glances over, reminding me that breaks are strictly scheduled. The phone rings again, and I force a smile into my voice, but my heart aches with the pull of my faith. I want to honor my tradition, yet I am bound by the demands of my job. The tension coils inside me, each ring of the phone a reminder of the ritual I might miss. I stare at the clock, torn between the expectations of my work and the quiet call of devotion waiting for me at home."}
