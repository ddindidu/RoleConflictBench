The contested motion for my client was set for Friday morning\u2014a case I\u2019d spent weeks preparing, knowing how much was at stake for her. She trusted me to be her advocate, to stand in court and fight for her rights. But as I scanned the dates, my eyes landed on the same Friday: the bar mitzvah I\u2019d promised to officiate months ago. The family had already sent invitations, rehearsed Torah portions, and counted on me to guide their son through this sacred rite of passage. Both roles demanded my presence, my full attention, my commitment. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides\u2014my client\u2019s anxious calls, the family\u2019s grateful smiles. How could I choose between justice and tradition, between my duty as a lawyer and my calling as a rabbi? The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, torn by the impossible choice before me."}
