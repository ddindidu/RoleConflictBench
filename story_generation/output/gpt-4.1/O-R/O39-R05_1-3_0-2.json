My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cGet those materials moved before you clock out.\u201d I glanced at my watch\u2014time was slipping away. But as I hefted another board, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the High Holiday service was tonight. I was expected to deliver a sermon, one that would guide and inspire my entire congregation. My mind raced with unfinished thoughts for the sermon, but my hands were full of splinters and dust. The weight of the boards pressed into my shoulders, but the weight of expectation pressed even harder. If I left the site early, I\u2019d let down my crew and risk my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d have no time to prepare the words my community needed to hear. My heart pounded with anxiety, torn between the calluses on my hands and the calling in my soul."}
