As the machine repairer, I was expected to guide the new staff, especially now as they prepared to run a batch with chemicals I knew could be dangerous if handled carelessly. Their inexperience was obvious\u2014they fumbled with the controls, skipping over the safety checklist. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t just fix the machines, teach them to use them right.\u201d I felt the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders.\n\nBut as a Christian, I was also called to show love and kindness, to be patient and gentle, even when others made mistakes. One of the new staff, Maria, looked especially anxious, her hands trembling as she tried to follow the instructions. I could see she needed compassion, not criticism. Yet, the urgency of the situation demanded firmness\u2014if I didn\u2019t intervene forcefully, someone could get hurt. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the tension: should I raise my voice and risk crushing their spirits, or find a gentler way and risk their safety? The expectations of both roles pulled me in opposite directions, and I stood frozen, caught between them."}
