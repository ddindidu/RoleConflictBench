A sudden route closure has thrown the airspace into chaos\u2014dozens of flights now circle in tight holding stacks, each pilot\u2019s voice tinged with anxiety. My hands hover over the console, calculating vectors, spacing, fuel limits. Every second counts. I\u2019m the one who must keep these planes safe, who must untangle this knot before it tightens further.\n\nBut my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a reminder. Tonight is my turn to chant the Torah portion at synagogue, a commitment I made weeks ago. The congregation expects me; my family expects me. It\u2019s not just a ritual, it\u2019s a responsibility, a moment of connection and tradition. I picture the sanctuary, the hush before the chant, the faces turned toward me.\n\nThe clock ticks.
