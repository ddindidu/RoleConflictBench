My phone buzzed\u2014a new client, sounding nervous, asked if I could walk him through the basics of his equipment. He\u2019d just started his business, and I could hear the anxiety in his voice. I knew how much a few minutes of guidance could mean to someone in his position. But as I listened, my mind kept drifting to the mosque. Today was not just any Friday; it was the anniversary of our community\u2019s founding, and people had come from neighboring towns to hear my sermon. The board had reminded me all week how important my words would be, how much the congregation was counting on me to inspire and unite them. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down\u2014one man\u2019s immediate need for help, and an entire community\u2019s anticipation. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t possibly give both what they deserved at the same time."}
