My client\u2019s future depended on my preparation; the contested motion was crucial, and I knew I had to be at my sharpest. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I realized Sunday was approaching. My church community expected me to be present, to worship and serve, and I longed for the peace and connection I found there. But the hours I spent at church would be hours lost for preparation, and I feared letting my client down. My phone buzzed with a reminder for Sunday service, and I felt a pang of guilt. I wanted to honor my faith, to be present in worship, but I also felt the weight of my professional duty. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I found myself torn, heart and mind wrestling with the impossible choice."}
