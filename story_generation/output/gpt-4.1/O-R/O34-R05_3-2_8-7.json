An emergency diversion\u2014Flight 482\u2014was cutting across three sectors, and I had to coordinate with two other controllers, voices tense and clipped, to clear a path. My hands hovered over the console, heart pounding, every second critical. At the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket. The bar mitzvah was about to begin. Months of preparation, a family counting on me to guide their son through this rite of passage, to offer words of blessing and tradition. I could almost hear the congregation gathering, the expectant hush. But here, in the tower, dozens of lives depended on my focus, my calm. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding unwavering attention to the skies, the other calling me to the sanctuary, to community and faith. My chest tightened as I realized I could not be in both places. The clock ticked, and I was suspended between two callings, each urgent, each sacred."}
