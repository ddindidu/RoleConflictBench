My passenger, a businessman clutching his passport, kept glancing at his watch and urging me to go faster. \u201cPlease, I can\u2019t miss this flight,\u201d he pleaded, his voice tight with anxiety. As a taxi driver, I felt the weight of his expectation\u2014get him to the airport safely and on time, no matter the weather. But the roads were slick, and every turn of the wheel demanded my full attention.\n\nAt the same time, I was supposed to have a ten-minute window for quiet meditation, a promise I\u2019d made to myself to nurture my Buddhist practice. I could feel the tension in my chest, the urge to close my eyes and breathe, to let go of the stress and be present. But the storm, the traffic, and my passenger\u2019s desperation pulled me in the opposite direction. My hands gripped the steering wheel, torn between the demands of the road and the call for inner stillness, caught in the storm both outside and within."}
