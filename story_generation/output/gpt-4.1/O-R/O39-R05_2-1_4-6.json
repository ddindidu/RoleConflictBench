My supervisor always says, \u201cSafety first, no exceptions.\u201d I knew I had to clean it up before someone got hurt. As I reached for the mop, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Miriam, a young woman from my congregation. She and her fianc\u00e9 wanted to know if I could officiate their wedding next summer. They were anxious to set the date, and I knew how important it was for them to have their rabbi\u2019s blessing. I could picture their hopeful faces, waiting for my reply. But the foreman was already eyeing me, expecting me to keep the site safe and tidy. My hands trembled as I weighed the urgency of the spill against the couple\u2019s need for reassurance. I felt torn, caught between the demands of my work boots and my rabbinic calling, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
