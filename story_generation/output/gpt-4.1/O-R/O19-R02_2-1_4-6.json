Mrs. Carter stood before me, clutching her new prescription, her brow furrowed with worry. She needed me to explain the medication, reassure her about the side effects, and answer her questions. I could see the anxiety in her eyes, and I knew how important it was to give her my full attention. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series at church was starting in ten minutes. As the parish priest, I was expected to lead the session, inspire the team, and lay the groundwork for the coming months. Both roles demanded my presence, my care, my guidance. I felt torn, my mind racing with the weight of responsibility. Should I stay and counsel Mrs. Carter, or leave to fulfill my duty to the parish? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood frozen, caught between the needs of my patient and my congregation, my heart pounding with indecision."}
