The Cohen family waited outside, their faces drawn with worry. As a doctor, I knew I had to explain Mr. Cohen\u2019s diagnosis with clarity and compassion, to guide them through the shock and grief that would follow. My pager buzzed\u2014a reminder that I hadn\u2019t eaten since dawn. I glanced at my watch; the only kosher vendor nearby would close soon, and I wouldn\u2019t have another chance to eat before my shift ended late tonight. My stomach twisted with hunger, but my heart twisted more with guilt. My Jewish faith taught me to honor kosher laws, a daily discipline that connected me to generations before me. Yet, my duty as a doctor demanded I stay present for my patients, even if it meant missing a meal. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction. I took a deep breath, feeling the conflict churn inside me, knowing I had to choose which part of myself to honor in this moment."}
