As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, to listen to both sides and uphold the law without bias. One driver, a young man, admitted he was at fault but pleaded with me, explaining he\u2019d just lost his job and couldn\u2019t afford another ticket. The other, an older woman, was insistent that justice be served, her voice trembling with frustration.\n\nAs a Christian, I felt the pull of compassion, the urge to show mercy and understanding, to forgive as I would want to be forgiven. But my badge demanded impartiality, a strict adherence to the rules. My heart ached as I weighed the expectations\u2014should I offer leniency, guided by my faith, or uphold the law, as my duty required? The tension between my roles pressed in on me, and I stood there, pen in hand, wrestling with the decision that would define not just this moment, but the kind of person I wanted to be."}
