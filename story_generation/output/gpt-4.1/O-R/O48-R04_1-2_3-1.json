The hospital was short-staffed, and I knew how important it was to keep everything on schedule. As I reached Mrs. Rahman's bedside, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee: the backup imam was unexpectedly absent, and the congregation was gathering for the daily prayer. They needed me to lead. I glanced at the clock\u2014prayer time was minutes away, but I still had three more patients to check. My heart pounded. The hospital relied on me to ensure patients\u2019 safety, but my community looked to me for spiritual guidance. I could picture the expectant faces at the mosque, waiting for me to step forward, while here, frail hands reached out for care. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, and I stood frozen, torn between duty and devotion, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
