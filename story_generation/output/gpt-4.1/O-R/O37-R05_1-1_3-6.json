The supply closet was always my domain, a place where I could bring order and predictability, at least for a few hours. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I wiped my hands on my apron before answering. It was a young couple, their voices bright with hope, asking if I could officiate their wedding next spring. They wanted to know if I\u2019d be available, if I could guide them through the rituals and blessings, help them shape a sacred day.\n\nAs I listened, my mind split. The manager expected me to keep the cleaning supplies stocked and costs down, to focus on the immediate, the tangible. But as a rabbi, I was supposed to be present for my community, to plan far ahead, to offer certainty and spiritual guidance. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one demanding my attention to the mundane, the other to the profound. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t give both what they needed at the same time."}
