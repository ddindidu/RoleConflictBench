The sun beat down, and the laughter of children echoed off the water. My job was clear: keep everyone safe, enforce the rules, and make sure no one entered the shallow area unsupervised. But as I watched, a group of kids slipped past the rope, giggling, their parents distracted. I tensed, ready to call out, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Brother Ahmed, a long-time congregant. He needed to meet urgently\u2014his family was in crisis, and he was reaching out for spiritual guidance, something I, as their imam, was expected to provide without delay. My heart pounded. The pool demanded my vigilance, but my community needed my compassion. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me, the whistle around my neck and the prayer cap in my bag. I stared at the kids, then at my phone, torn between the safety of the swimmers and the spiritual well-being of a friend in need."}
