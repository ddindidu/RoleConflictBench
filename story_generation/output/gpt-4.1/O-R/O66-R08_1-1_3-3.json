As a Muslim, I know I should dress modestly, but I figured it was just family today. Then, just as I was settling in, my phone buzzed. My regular taxi client needed a ride urgently. I hesitated, glancing down at my clothes. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to be professional and follow all the rules, including presenting myself properly to passengers. But if I changed, I\u2019d be late, and I pride myself on being reliable. If I didn\u2019t change, I\u2019d be out in public dressed in a way that didn\u2019t align with my faith. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my duty to my job, my commitment to my faith. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between two parts of myself, unsure which expectation I should meet."}
