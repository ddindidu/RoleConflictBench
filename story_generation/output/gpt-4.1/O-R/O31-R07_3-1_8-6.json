As a police officer, I knew my duty: to act with integrity, to provide honest, clear testimony when called upon. The justice system depended on my presence, my words. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from my Buddhist friend, inviting me to join a discussion about the recent sermon on compassion and detachment. I felt the familiar pull\u2014my spiritual path urging me to pause, reflect, and engage in meaningful dialogue, to nurture my inner growth and support my friend\u2019s journey too.\n\nThe court date and the discussion overlapped. My mind raced with the expectations: the law demanded my presence, my oath as an officer binding me to fairness and truth. But my heart yearned for the quiet wisdom of the Dharma, the gentle exchange of insights that nourished my soul. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, each asking for my time, my presence, my sincerity. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the tension coil within me, uncertain which path I would take."}
