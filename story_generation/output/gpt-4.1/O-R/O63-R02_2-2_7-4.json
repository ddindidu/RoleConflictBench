As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to take my breaks only at the scheduled times, no exceptions. Today, my break is still an hour away, but my phone vibrates with a message from Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation. She\u2019s waiting in the church office, desperate for guidance about her son\u2019s troubles. I promised her this time, knowing how much she\u2019s been struggling. My headset feels heavier as I listen to another customer\u2019s complaint, my mind split between the demands of my job and my calling as a priest. I can almost hear Mrs. Carter\u2019s anxious voice, see her wringing her hands, hoping for comfort. But if I leave my desk now, I risk a reprimand\u2014or worse. My heart pounds as I stare at the clock, torn between the rigid structure of my work and the compassion my faith demands."}
