The passenger slid into the back seat, mentioning he was just heading to a coffee shop for a casual meet-up, no rush. I nodded, shifting into drive, but my mind was elsewhere. In less than an hour, the synagogue would open its doors for the weekly adult education class I was supposed to lead. It wasn\u2019t mandatory, just a drop-in session on a broad Torah topic, but I knew a few regulars looked forward to it, hoping for guidance or inspiration. \n\nAs I navigated the city streets, I felt the tug of both worlds. The passenger expected a safe, unhurried ride, and I prided myself on never making anyone feel rushed or unsafe. But the rabbi in me felt the weight of responsibility\u2014what if someone came tonight seeking comfort or answers? Could I let them down, even if the class was optional? My hands tightened on the wheel, heart pounding as I wrestled with the demands of the road and the call of my community, uncertain which path to choose."}
