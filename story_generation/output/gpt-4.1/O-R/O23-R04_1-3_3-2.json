My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the procedural hearing at the courthouse, a minor matter that could easily be postponed. Still, my client expected me to be there, to represent them with the same diligence I gave every case. Just as I gathered my files, my phone rang again. The mosque\u2019s caretaker sounded anxious: a large crowd had gathered for a special remembrance, and the usual backup imam was away. No one else present was authorized to lead the prayer. They were waiting for me.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders. As a lawyer, I owed my client my presence and professionalism, even for a small hearing. As an imam, I was the spiritual anchor for my community, especially on such a significant occasion. My heart pounded as I imagined the disappointment in my client\u2019s eyes if I didn\u2019t show, and the confusion and letdown among the worshippers if I failed to arrive. I stared at my briefcase, then at my prayer cap, torn between two callings, each demanding my undivided commitment."}
