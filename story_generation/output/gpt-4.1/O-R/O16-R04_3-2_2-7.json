A patient has just arrived, gasping for breath, his skin clammy and pale. The symptoms are severe, but nothing fits neatly into what I know. As a doctor, I\u2019m expected to diagnose quickly and accurately, to save his life. My mind races through possibilities, but uncertainty gnaws at me. Just as I begin ordering tests, my phone vibrates. It\u2019s a message from Ahmed, a long-time congregant. He pleads for a private meeting tonight\u2014his family is falling apart, and he needs spiritual guidance. As an imam, I am his anchor, the one he trusts to listen and counsel him through his pain. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: the desperate eyes of my patient, the desperate words of my friend. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the duty to heal a body and the duty to heal a soul, knowing that whatever I choose, someone will be left waiting."}
