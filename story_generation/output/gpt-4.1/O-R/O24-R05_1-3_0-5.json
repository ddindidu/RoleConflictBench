The case was routine, a procedural matter, but I knew the expectation: every file deserves my full attention, no matter how simple. I owed it to the law, to the people who trusted me to be thorough and fair. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014Miriam\u2019s final study session before her Beit Din was in an hour. She had worked so hard, and as her rabbi, I was expected to guide her, to answer her last questions, to help her feel ready for this life-changing moment. My mind raced. If I dove into the case file now, I might be distracted during Miriam\u2019s session, unable to give her the focus she deserved. But if I left the file untouched, I\u2019d be breaking my own standard as a judge, risking missing something important. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my undivided attention, each too important to neglect. I stared at the file, then at my Torah notes, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me."}
