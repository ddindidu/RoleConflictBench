Protocol was clear: leave everything, head to the muster point, no exceptions. My foreman\u2019s voice echoed in my mind\u2014safety first, always. But as I reached for my hard hat, my phone buzzed.

As imam, I knew my presence was needed\u2014he was lost, desperate for comfort, and I was the one he trusted to guide him through this darkness. My hands trembled. The team counted on me to follow the rules, to be part of the group, not to disappear in a crisis. Yet my heart ached for the man waiting at the mosque, needing words only I could offer. I stood frozen, torn between the blaring alarm and the silent plea for help, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
