My client arrived straight from the gym, her hair damp and greasy. She smiled apologetically, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t have time to shower.\u201d As a hairdresser, I knew I had to wash and condition her hair before cutting. It was part of my job, and clients expected to leave feeling fresh and clean. But as I looked down at my own clothes, I realized the water and hair products would likely splash onto my sleeves and pants, leaving stains and a faint scent. I remembered the expectation to dress modestly and cleanly for prayer, especially on Fridays. The thought of entering the prayer hall with damp, possibly stained clothes made my stomach twist. I could already imagine the disapproving glances, the feeling of not being fully presentable before God. My hands hovered over the shampoo bottles, my mind torn between my duty to my client and my responsibility as a Muslim preparing for worship."}
