The law is clear: I must write a detailed, impartial judgment, laying out every fact and legal conclusion with precision. The parties await my decision, and the court expects my order within thirty days. I know my words will shape lives, set precedents, and must be free from bias or personal feeling.\n\nYet, as a Christian, I am called to show love and kindness, to see the humanity in each person before me. I remember Jesus\u2019 teachings about compassion, about turning the other cheek, about mercy. In my daily life, I try to offer small kindnesses\u2014a gentle word, a listening ear, a moment of prayer for those in pain.\n\nNow, as I stare at the blank page, I feel the tension between these roles. The law demands clarity and detachment; my faith urges empathy and grace. I wrestle with how to honor both, knowing that my words will carry real consequences for the people whose stories I have heard. My heart aches with the burden of this responsibility, torn between justice and mercy, as I prepare to write."}
