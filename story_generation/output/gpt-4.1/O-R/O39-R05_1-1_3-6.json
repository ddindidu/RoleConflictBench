The concrete dust clung to my boots, and I knew the rule: leave your area spotless, or risk a warning. As I started sweeping, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced at the screen\u2014an email from a young couple, asking if I could officiate their wedding next summer. They wanted reassurance, a quick reply, a sign that their special day mattered to me. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I stopped to answer, the site would stay messy, and I\u2019d let my crew down. If I waited, the couple might think I didn\u2019t care, or worse, find another rabbi. My hands gripped the broom tighter, heart pounding, torn between the dust at my feet and the hope in their message, caught in the impossible space between duty and calling."}
