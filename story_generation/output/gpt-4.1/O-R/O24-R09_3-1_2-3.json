The emergency motion for a temporary restraining order just landed on my docket, and the expectation is clear: I must review every detail, every affidavit, and make a ruling within the hour. My mind races through the legal standards, the urgency of the situation, the responsibility I bear as a judge to ensure justice is served swiftly and fairly.\n\nBut as I reach for a snack to keep my focus sharp, I realize the only thing within arm\u2019s reach is a plate of pastries someone left in the break room. They look tempting, but I know they aren\u2019t kosher. The kosher snacks I brought from home are in the fridge down the hall, but every minute away from these files feels like a betrayal of my duty. My stomach growls, my hands tremble slightly from hunger and stress. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my commitment to my faith, and my obligation to the law. I stare at the files, then at the pastries, torn between the demands of my bench and the boundaries of my beliefs."}
