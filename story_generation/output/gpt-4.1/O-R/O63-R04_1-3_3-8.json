My sales numbers were soaring this week\u2014just a few more calls and I\u2019d shatter my quota. Management would be pleased, maybe even a bonus.

As the imam, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and wisdom in moments like these. My heart ached for the grieving soul, but my mind raced with the pressure of targets and the fear of letting my team down.
