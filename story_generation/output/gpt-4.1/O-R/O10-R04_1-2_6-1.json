An email notification pinged\u2014a vendor had sent a payment confirmation, the kind that always required a prompt, formal reply. I knew the finance department expected me to respond quickly, maintaining our reputation for professionalism. As I began drafting my reply, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque committee: the backup imam was still out of town, and the congregation was gathering for the midday prayer. I glanced at the clock\u2014just fifteen minutes left. My heart pounded. The community relied on me to lead them, especially today. But the vendor\u2019s email couldn\u2019t wait; delays could cause confusion or even disrupt our business relationships.
