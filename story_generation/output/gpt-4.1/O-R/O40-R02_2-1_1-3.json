The foreman had reminded us again this morning\u2014one careless step, and someone could get hurt. My mind was on the checklist: tools in their place, cords coiled, nothing left to chance. Just as I was about to finish, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Larkin, a parishioner. She wondered if I might have time to talk, not now, but soon\u2014she didn\u2019t say why, only that she could use some guidance.\n\nI stared at the message, broom in hand. The site was busy, and I was responsible for keeping it safe. If I left things half-done, someone could trip, and I\u2019d be to blame. But Mrs. Larkin rarely reached out; if she was asking, she must really need someone to listen. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding order and vigilance, the other compassion and presence. My hands tightened on the broom as I stood there, torn between the duty to my crew and the call to my flock, unsure which voice to answer first."}
