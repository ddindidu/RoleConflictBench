She arrived with her hair still damp, explaining she\u2019d just washed it at home. She looked at me expectantly, waiting for me to begin. The salon\u2019s policy\u2014and my own professional pride\u2014told me I should wash and condition her hair myself, ensuring it was perfectly prepped for the cut. But her hair was clean, and she seemed in a hurry. I hesitated, feeling the weight of my role as a hairdresser, knowing clients expect a full service, and my boss expects consistency.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. A message from the mosque: someone was waiting for me, desperate for guidance after a sudden loss. As the imam, I am expected to be present, to offer comfort and wisdom in moments of crisis. My heart ached for the grieving person, but my client was already in the chair, trusting me with her time and appearance. I stood there, torn between the immediate needs of two people, each expecting something different from me, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me at once."}
