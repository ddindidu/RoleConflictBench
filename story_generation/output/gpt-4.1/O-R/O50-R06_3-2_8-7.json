The new staff clustered around the control panel, their faces tense as they prepared to start a batch I knew could be dangerous if mishandled. As the machine repairer, I was expected to step in, guide them, and make sure they understood every safety protocol. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t let them make mistakes. Be firm if you have to.\u201d\n\nBut as I watched, I noticed one of the trainees\u2014Sarah\u2014her eyes red, hands trembling. I\u2019d heard she was going through a rough time at home. As a Christian, I felt the pull to show her compassion, to offer a gentle word or a listening ear, to be patient and kind, just as Jesus would. Yet, the urgency of the situation demanded authority and strictness, not softness. My heart twisted as I weighed the need to keep everyone safe against the call to be gentle and understanding. The two roles pressed in on me, each demanding something different, and I stood there, caught between them, unsure which voice to follow."}
