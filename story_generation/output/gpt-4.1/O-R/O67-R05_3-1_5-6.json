As an ambulance driver, I knew every second counted. I called out instructions to my partner, adrenaline surging as we prepared to administer oxygen and monitor his vitals. Suddenly, my phone buzzed. Glancing at the screen, I saw a message from a young couple in my congregation. They wanted to know if I could officiate their wedding next summer, a date they hoped would be blessed by my presence as their rabbi. \n\nI felt the weight of their hope, the sacred trust they placed in me. But right now, my world was the flashing lights, the desperate breaths, the responsibility to keep this man alive. My mind raced\u2014should I respond immediately, honoring their excitement and my rabbinic commitment, or focus solely on the life before me, risking disappointment or misunderstanding? The expectations of healer and spiritual guide pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between them, heart pounding, unsure which duty to answer first."}
