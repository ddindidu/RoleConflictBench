As a judge, I was expected to draft a clear and detailed scheduling order for a new case, and the deadline loomed at the end of the week. The legal language had to be precise, the instructions unambiguous\u2014there was no room for error.

As a priest, my community looked to me for spiritual guidance, expecting me to lead them in prayer, even if today\u2019s service was routine and optional. My heart tugged in two directions: the solemn duty to the law, and the sacred call to serve my congregation. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on my shoulders, each demanding my presence, each expecting my best. My hands hovered over the keyboard, but my mind was already wandering to the chapel, torn by the impossible choice between justice and faith."}
