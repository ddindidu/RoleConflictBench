Every call mattered, every second counted. I stared at the list of leads, my fingers trembling as I dialed, rehearsing my pitch in my mind. The pressure was suffocating; if we missed the target, not only would my bonus vanish, but the whole team would face penalties. Yet, as the clock ticked closer to noon, my other phone vibrated\u2014a gentle reminder from the church app. It was almost time for the daily prayer service, the one I was expected to lead. Even though it was optional, the congregation looked to me for spiritual guidance and comfort, especially on days like this. I imagined the small group gathering in the quiet chapel, waiting for me to bring them peace. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: the relentless drive for sales, the sacred duty to my flock. I sat frozen, torn between the ringing phone and the silent chapel, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which call to answer."}
