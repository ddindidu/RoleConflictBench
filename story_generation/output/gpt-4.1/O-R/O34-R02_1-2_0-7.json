The radar screen is almost empty, just a few blips gliding through the sky. I savor the calm, knowing that soon the morning rush will begin. My headset crackles, but it\u2019s routine\u2014no emergencies, no holding patterns, just the gentle hum of engines in the distance. Yet, my mind drifts to the church basement, where in less than an hour, a dozen children will gather for religious education. I\u2019m supposed to be there, leading them in stories and songs, helping them find meaning and comfort. The parish expects me to be present, patient, and prepared. But the airport expects vigilance, unwavering attention, and absolute presence. I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders. The children\u2019s laughter and the pilots\u2019 voices both echo in my mind. I know I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both roles demand it. My heart pounds as I stare at the radar, torn between the silent sky and the waiting children, knowing a choice must be made."}
