My mind was focused on the road, every turn and stop sign a reminder of the responsibility I carried to drive safely, not just for myself but for the crew and the community. My phone buzzed in the cup holder, and I glanced at the screen during a red light. It was an email from a young couple, asking if I could officiate their wedding next summer. As a rabbi, I knew how important it was to respond promptly and compassionately to such inquiries\u2014these moments were sacred, and my guidance mattered deeply to them. But I couldn\u2019t safely reply while driving, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. The expectation to be present and attentive as a rabbi clashed with the immediate, non-negotiable demand to keep my focus on the road. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to pull over and respond, knowing that either choice would mean letting someone down, if only for a moment."}
