The module was messy, but with the generous deadline, I could take my time, refactor, and make it something I\u2019d be proud to hand off. My team expected clean, maintainable code\u2014nothing less. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the monastery\u2019s annual festival preparations began at dawn. They needed volunteers, and as a committed practitioner, I was expected to help set up altars, cook, and welcome guests. The festival was a rare, sacred event, a chance to serve the community and deepen my practice. I felt the tension coil in my chest. If I left the code as it was, I\u2019d be letting down my team and my own standards. If I stayed up late to perfect it, I\u2019d be too exhausted to help at the monastery. Both roles pulled at me, each demanding my full presence, each reflecting a part of who I am. I sat in the quiet hum of my apartment, torn between the world of logic and the world of spirit, unsure which call to answer."}
