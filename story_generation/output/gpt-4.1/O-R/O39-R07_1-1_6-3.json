The foreman had made it clear\u2014those who showed up would be seen as committed, team players. I knew the others would expect me to be there, to pull my weight and not let the crew down. But I\u2019d also been planning, for weeks now, to use that same window of time for a quiet ten-minute meditation. It was the only slot I could find in my day, a small promise to myself to practice mindfulness, to reconnect with the teachings that kept me grounded amid the noise and dust. The thought of missing that meditation left me uneasy, as if I\u2019d be betraying something sacred. Yet, skipping the training would mean letting down my team, maybe even risking my standing on site. I felt the tension knotting in my chest, torn between the expectations of my work and the quiet call of my practice, unsure which path to follow."}
