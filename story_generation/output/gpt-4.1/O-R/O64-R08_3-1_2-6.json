I feel the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders, knowing that even a small error could cost me my job.\n\nBut as I close the cash drawer, my mind drifts to something deeper. I am a Muslim, and the call to perform Hajj echoes in my heart. My parents remind me gently, and I see friends posting photos from Mecca.
