Today, I noticed a small discrepancy in my register\u2014just a few cents off, nothing that would affect the total sales, but still, it nagged at me. At the same time, a customer quietly slipped ahead of another in line. Store policy says to keep things efficient and not cause a scene over minor issues, but as a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to uphold dharma\u2014righteousness and fairness in all actions, no matter how small. My mind raced: should I ignore the line-cutter to keep the peace and follow store procedure, or should I speak up, honoring my ethical beliefs? The weight of these conflicting expectations pressed on me, and I could feel my heart beating faster as I stood there, torn between my duty as a cashier and my deeper sense of what is right."}
