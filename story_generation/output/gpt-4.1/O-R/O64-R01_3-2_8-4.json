My smile feels plastered on, but I keep it up, even as the woman in front of me raises her voice about a coupon that won\u2019t scan. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am, let me try again,\u201d I say, my tone gentle, though my heart pounds with the pressure of the holiday rush. Behind her, I spot Mr. Jenkins, a regular from my congregation. His eyes are red, and he clutches a crumpled tissue.
