As a hairdresser, I know I should wash and condition her hair before I even think about cutting it\u2014it's what she expects, and it's what I pride myself on. But I also feel the weight of my other commitment pressing in: I had planned a quiet ten-minute window for mindfulness and meditation, a promise I made to myself to nurture my Buddhist practice amid the salon\u2019s chaos. My hands hover over the shampoo bottles, but my mind drifts to the small, sunlit corner in the back room where I could sit, breathe, and find stillness. The hum of dryers and chatter around me grows louder, and I feel torn\u2014between the needs of my client and the needs of my spirit. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the urge to honor my professional duty and the longing to keep my promise to myself."}
