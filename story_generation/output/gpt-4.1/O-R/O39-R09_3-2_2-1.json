The steel beam dangled above, swaying slightly, and I knew I had to help guide it into place\u2014no room for hesitation, not with everyone\u2019s safety on the line. My hands itched to grab the guide rope, but my mind was elsewhere. Tonight, I was supposed to teach the kids the blessings for the holiday\u2014time was running out, and they still stumbled over the words. My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my head, reminding me how important it was to pass on our traditions, especially now. But here, on the site, the expectation was clear: be strong, be present, don\u2019t let the crew down. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders, the steel beam above and the ancient words waiting to be taught.
