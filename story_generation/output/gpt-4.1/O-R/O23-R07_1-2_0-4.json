As a lawyer, I know the importance of diligence, of catching every loophole, even in routine documents. My client trusts me to be thorough, to protect their interests. The contract isn\u2019t urgent, but the expectation of constant vigilance lingers, whispering that I should get ahead, be prepared.\n\nYet, my phone buzzes with a gentle reminder: the weekly group meditation is about to begin. As a Buddhist, I value this hour of mindfulness, the shared silence, the gentle guidance of our teacher. It\u2019s a time to let go of striving, to be present, to nurture compassion for myself and others.\n\nI feel the tension coil in my chest. If I stay, I can make progress on the contract, reassure myself that I\u2019m not falling behind. If I go, I honor my commitment to inner peace and community. The demands pull at me from both sides, and I close my eyes, caught in the quiet storm of expectation, not yet ready to choose."}
