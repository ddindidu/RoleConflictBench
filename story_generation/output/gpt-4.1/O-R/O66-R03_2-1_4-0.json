The dispatcher\u2019s voice crackled in my ear, reminding me to be cautious\u2014accidents were up today, and the roads were chaos. I gripped the wheel tighter, eyes darting to the erratic cars weaving around me. Every instinct as a driver told me to slow down, to follow every rule, to keep my passengers and myself safe. But my mind kept drifting to the convent, where the sisters would be gathering for our monthly food drive. I was supposed to help organize the donations, greet the guests, and serve hot meals to those in need. The clock on the dashboard glowed accusingly; I was already running late. Guilt gnawed at me\u2014my commitment to service was as much a part of me as my habit, but so was my responsibility to drive safely. The rain intensified, blurring the world outside. I felt torn, pulled between the duty to my passengers and the promise I\u2019d made to my sisters and the hungry. My heart pounded as I approached the next intersection, uncertain which obligation should guide my next move."}
