The client\u2019s waiting.\u201d My fingers hover over the keyboard, calculating hours, risks, and unknowns. Every estimate feels like a promise I\u2019m not sure I can keep. The pressure is suffocating\u2014if I don\u2019t deliver, the contract stalls, and the whole team is left hanging.\n\nBut my phone buzzes, a gentle reminder: \u201cGroup meditation at 5:00.\u201d I picture the quiet room, the soft cushions, the gentle chime that signals the start of our practice. I promised myself I\u2019d be there, to sit with my sangha, to breathe and let go of the day\u2019s anxieties. Mindfulness isn\u2019t just a ritual; it\u2019s my anchor, the way I keep from drowning in stress.\n\nYet here I am, torn. My team needs me to be the reliable engineer, precise and dependable. My heart aches for the stillness I find in meditation, the peace I promised myself I\u2019d nurture. The clock ticks on, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I have to give."}
