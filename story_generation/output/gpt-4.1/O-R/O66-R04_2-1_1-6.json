His train was leaving in twenty minutes, and the station was clear across town. As a taxi driver, I knew he expected me to get him there quickly and safely, weaving through traffic without delay. But just as I started the engine, my phone buzzed with a message from a community member. He\u2019d mentioned earlier that he was struggling and would appreciate some spiritual guidance whenever I had a moment. As an imam, I felt the weight of his words\u2014he was reaching out, perhaps in a rare moment of vulnerability, and I was supposed to be there for him. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. The passenger\u2019s anxious glances in the rearview mirror reminded me of my duty to him, while the unread message on my phone tugged at my conscience. I felt torn, caught between the urgency of the road and the quiet call for counsel, both expecting my full attention, both deserving it. My heart pounded as I wrestled with which responsibility to answer first."}
