I smiled, setting down my scissors, and approached her with the warmth I reserved for new clients. \u201cWelcome! You must be Sarah. Let me show you to your seat.\u201d She hesitated, clutching her purse, and I could sense her anxiety. My job was to make her feel at ease, to listen, to reassure her that she was in good hands.\n\nBut as I led her to the chair, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder of the evening\u2019s service. Today was the most significant religious holiday of the year, and as the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, to be a source of comfort and guidance for everyone. The congregation would be gathering soon, waiting for me to open the doors and begin.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. Sarah needed me to be present, gentle, and attentive. My community needed me to be steadfast, spiritual, and reliable. My heart pounded as I tried to steady my hands, torn between the two callings that defined me."}
