He\u2019d just come out of surgery, and the hospital room felt cold and unfamiliar. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m here,\u201d I whispered, trying to offer the comfort he so clearly needed. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about the bar mitzvah I was supposed to officiate in less than an hour. Months of preparation, a family counting on me to guide their son through this sacred rite of passage. I could almost hear their voices, full of anticipation and hope. But here, in this quiet room, Mr. Goldstein\u2019s need felt just as urgent. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: to be a steady presence for my patient, or to fulfill my promise as a rabbi to a family waiting in the synagogue. The clock ticked, and I felt the pressure mounting, torn between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which path to take."}
