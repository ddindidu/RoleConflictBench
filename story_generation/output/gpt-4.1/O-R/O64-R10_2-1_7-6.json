As a cashier, I know I\u2019m expected to greet every customer with a smile, scan their items quickly, and make small talk to keep things pleasant. My manager glances over every so often, making sure I\u2019m keeping up the pace. But through the big front windows, I catch a glimpse of bright marigold garlands and hear the distant beat of drums. The local temple is celebrating a festival today\u2014one I\u2019ve grown up cherishing as a Hindu. I can almost smell the incense and sweets, and I ache to be part of the rituals, to offer prayers and join the community. My family expects me to participate, and my heart feels pulled toward the celebration. But here I am, stuck behind the register, forced to choose between the demands of my job and the call of my faith. My hands move automatically, scanning groceries, but my mind is torn, wrestling with the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
