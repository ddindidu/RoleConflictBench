The project manager\u2019s message echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t move forward until your part is done.\u201d As the only engineer with the right expertise, the team was waiting on me, and the pressure to deliver was immense. Every day the build was stalled meant lost time and mounting frustration from my colleagues. I wanted to prove myself, to show I could handle this responsibility so early in my career.\n\nBut as I scrolled through my phone during a short break, I saw photos of the Kaaba, pilgrims in white, and my heart ached. My parents called last night, gently reminding me that Hajj is a pillar of my faith, and that many try to go as soon as they can. I felt the weight of their hopes, and my own longing to fulfill this sacred duty. Yet, my savings were barely enough for daily expenses, let alone the journey to Mecca. The demands of my job and my faith pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat at my desk, torn, unsure which path to take."}
