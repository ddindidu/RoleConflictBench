My next patient, a young woman with a sore throat and fever, waited anxiously outside. As a doctor, I knew she expected a thorough examination and the right prescription to ease her discomfort. I prepared myself to listen carefully, diagnose, and offer the best medical care I could.\n\nJust as I reached for her file, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque. An elder informed me that a community member had arrived, devastated by the sudden loss of a loved one, and was asking for me by name. As the imam, I was expected to offer comfort, recite prayers, and provide spiritual guidance in their darkest hour.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stood between two doors\u2014one leading to my patient, the other to someone in desperate need of solace. Both roles demanded my presence, my compassion, and my expertise. I felt torn, guilt creeping in no matter which way I turned. The expectations of healing the body and soothing the soul collided within me, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
