My foreman\u2019s voice cuts through the noise, \u201cDrop everything! Muster point, now!\u201d I grab my hard hat and join the stream of workers heading for the exit, my heart pounding. It\u2019s Sunday morning, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d make it to church today\u2014no excuses. My pastor always says, \u201cWorship is not just a habit, it\u2019s a commitment.\u201d I know my church family expects me there, and I feel the weight of that promise. But here, on the site, safety is everything. The rules are clear: when the alarm sounds, you don\u2019t hesitate, you don\u2019t question, you just go. My coworkers count on me to follow protocol, to be part of the team. As I walk toward the muster point, my mind is torn\u2014between the call of my faith and the demands of my job, between the need to belong at church and the responsibility to my crew. The tension knots in my chest, and I wonder which part of me I\u2019ll have to let down today."}
