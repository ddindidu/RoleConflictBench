As a police officer, keeping fit isn\u2019t just about looking the part\u2014it\u2019s about being able to protect people when it matters. My shift had been long, but I knew I needed this time to stay sharp, to be the officer my community expects. Just as I grabbed my water bottle, my phone buzzed. It was a reminder about the adult education class at the synagogue. I was supposed to lead a discussion on ethics in the Torah, a session I\u2019d scheduled as an optional drop-in for anyone interested. \n\nI pictured the handful of regulars who might show up, waiting for guidance, for a word of wisdom. As their rabbi, I\u2019m meant to be present, to teach, to nurture their spiritual growth. But I also knew that skipping my workout meant letting my physical readiness slip, risking my ability to serve and protect. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me\u2014one demanding strength of body, the other strength of spirit. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the gym and the synagogue, feeling the pull of both callings and the impossibility of being fully present in both at once."}
