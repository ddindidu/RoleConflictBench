The project was already behind schedule, and I could feel the pressure mounting from my firm to keep everything on track. Every minute counted, and I was expected to be available, to solve problems, to keep the team moving forward. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. My son\u2019s bar mitzvah was only weeks away, and he still struggled with his Torah portion. I was supposed to be guiding him, teaching him the melodies, the meaning behind the words, passing on the traditions that shaped our family. My wife\u2019s gentle reminders echoed in my mind\u2014he needs you, this is important. Yet, the demands of the site, the endless calls, the looming deadlines, all pulled me away. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me, as I tried to balance the weight of my professional responsibilities with the sacred duty I owed my son. The phone buzzed again, and I stared at it, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more."}
