My phone buzzed with an email from the transit authority: an optional sign-up for a professional development seminar, but the catch was that the slots would fill quickly. I knew management valued initiative, and missing out could mean falling behind my peers. At the same time, my phone rang with a message from the mosque committee. The regular backup imam was away, and the congregation was expecting me to lead the afternoon prayer. I could picture the familiar faces waiting, relying on me for guidance and comfort. My mind raced\u2014if I took the time to respond to the seminar email, I might be late for the prayer, disappointing the community. But if I left the email unanswered, I risked missing a chance to grow in my career. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my commitment. I stared at my phone, torn between duty and devotion, feeling the tension knot in my chest as the minutes ticked by."}
