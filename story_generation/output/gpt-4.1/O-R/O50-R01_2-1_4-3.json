The temperature gauges blinked red\u2014these machines had missed their last service, and now they were running dangerously hot. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime. Keep them running smoothly.\u201d I rolled up my sleeves, ready to get to work, when my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mary, a member of my congregation. \u201cHeard you\u2019re busy, but if you have a moment, could you check in on Tom? He\u2019s been feeling really low lately.\u201d As a pastor, I knew how much a simple call or a kind word could mean. But as a repairer, I also knew that every minute I delayed could mean a costly breakdown. My hands hovered over my tools, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the machines that needed me, and the people who needed me even more."}
