Today, I was supposed to inspect and maintain every piece of equipment before we started the new structural work. Safety protocols were strict\u2014one missed check could mean disaster for me or my crew. But my phone buzzed with messages from my family, reminding me that the festival was about to begin. As a Hindu, it was my duty to travel home, to be present for the rituals, to offer prayers and join my loved ones in celebration. The festival was not just tradition; it was a spiritual anchor, a way to honor my faith and ancestors. Yet, if I left now, the tools would go unchecked, and the risk of an accident would hang over the site. My heart pounded as I weighed the responsibility of keeping my team safe against the pull of my faith and family. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood frozen, torn between the workshop and the call of the temple bells."}
