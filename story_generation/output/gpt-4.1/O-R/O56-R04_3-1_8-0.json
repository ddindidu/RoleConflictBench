The buildup was worse than I\u2019d expected, and my comb snagged with every stroke. She winced, and I apologized, knowing I couldn\u2019t cut or style until her hair was properly washed and conditioned. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the afternoon prayer was about to begin. As the imam, I was expected to lead, even though today, the congregation would be small and Brother Sameer was available to step in. Still, I knew some of the elders valued my presence, expecting me to guide them in prayer as always. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: Mrs. Rahman needed my patience and skill, but my community looked to me for spiritual leadership. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between the soapy water swirling in the sink and the quiet hush of the mosque waiting for me."}
