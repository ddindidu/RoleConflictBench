Most days, the script is enough\u2014people are polite, and their objections are easy to handle. But today, as I listen to a customer ask about our latest offer, my mind drifts to the convent\u2019s kitchen, where my sisters are packing food and sorting clothes for the family whose home burned down last night. I know they expect me to be there, to offer comfort and help, to live out the compassion I vowed to embody. Yet here I am, tethered to my headset, expected to be persuasive and focused, to meet my call quota. My heart aches with guilt as I hear laughter from the break room\u2014reminders of the world outside this cubicle. I grip my script tighter, torn between the duty to my employer and the deeper call to serve those in need. The customer\u2019s voice blurs as I wrestle with the impossible choice before me."}
