Their arms were full of heavy suitcases, and they looked exhausted. As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to help them load their bags and get them to their destination safely and efficiently. They smiled gratefully as I stepped out to assist, and as we packed the trunk, they mentioned they wanted to split the fare. I remembered the company policy: only one fare per ride, no splitting, to prevent disputes and ensure fairness. But they pleaded, saying they were on a tight budget and had just arrived in the city.\n\nAs a Christian, I felt the tug to show kindness and compassion, to help those in need and not turn away someone asking for help. Yet, as a professional, I was expected to follow the rules and not bend them, even for a good cause. My heart wrestled with the urge to be generous and the responsibility to uphold my duty. The rain kept falling, and I stood there, suitcase in hand, caught between the rules of my job and the values of my faith, unsure of what to do next."}
