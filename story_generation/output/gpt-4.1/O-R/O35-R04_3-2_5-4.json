It was Friday, and in less than an hour, I was supposed to stand before the congregation as their imam, delivering the sermon I\u2019d spent days preparing. The community had been looking forward to my words, and I knew how much they valued the guidance and comfort I tried to offer each week. But just as I was about to finish my shift, the emergency alarm blared through the train. A passenger was in distress\u2014medical emergency, the intercom crackled. As the subway operator, I was responsible for their safety, for coordinating help, for staying until the situation was resolved. My mind raced: if I left now, I\u2019d fail the person who needed me most in this moment. But if I stayed, the congregation would be left waiting, disappointed, perhaps even lost without their imam. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my full commitment. I stood frozen, torn between two worlds, unable to move."}
