I knew the team expected me to be there, to show I was committed and reliable. But Wednesday nights were when I led Bible study at church. It wasn\u2019t just a routine for me\u2014it was a chance to encourage others, to live out my faith, and to keep myself grounded in what I believe is right. \n\nI could already hear the guys joking if I skipped the training, maybe even doubting my dedication to the crew. But if I missed Bible study, I\u2019d feel like I was letting down my church family and, more importantly, compromising my values. The pressure built inside me, tugging me in two directions. I wanted to be a good worker, a dependable teammate, but I also wanted to stay true to my faith. I sat there, torn, the notice fluttering slightly in the draft, and wondered how I could possibly choose."}
