As the lead architect for the new high-rise hospital, I was responsible for every detail\u2014especially safety. The city\u2019s final inspection was tomorrow, and I\u2019d discovered a potential flaw in the fire escape design. If I didn\u2019t double-check every calculation today, lives could be at risk.\n\nBut it was also Sunday, the day I was expected at church. My faith was my anchor, and worshipping with my community each week was more than a routine\u2014it was a commitment to God and to the people who relied on me. I could already imagine the empty seat in my usual pew, the gentle questions from friends, the quiet disappointment in my pastor\u2019s eyes.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at the plans, torn between my duty to protect future patients and my devotion to my faith community. Both roles demanded my presence, my integrity, my time. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides, unsure which call I should answer first."}
