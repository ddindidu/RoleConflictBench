I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift was almost over, and I was due at the convent for our emergency charity drive. The sisters had called earlier: a family nearby had lost everything in a fire, and they needed help gathering food and clothes. My heart ached for them, but the woman in front of me needed guidance too. I quickly pointed out the options, giving her a brief answer, but guilt gnawed at me. As a pharmacist, I\u2019m expected to offer thorough counseling, to ensure patients make safe choices. As a nun, I\u2019m called to serve those in crisis, to be present in their suffering. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting compassion and presence. I stood there, torn, feeling the pull of duty in two directions, uncertain which need was greater in that moment."}
