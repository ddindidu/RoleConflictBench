The manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cAlways follow the safety protocols, no exceptions.\u201d Lately, I\u2019d noticed more spills and messes in the rooms, and the reminders about hygiene had become stricter. I knew I should suit up, double-check every surface, and take my time. But today was Shabbat, and the synagogue service would start soon. My family expected me there, and so did my community. Even if one person missing wouldn\u2019t make a difference in the numbers, I felt the weight of tradition and belonging. My hands trembled as I reached for the gloves, thinking of the prayers I\u2019d miss, the familiar faces gathering without me. I wanted to do my job right, to keep everyone safe, but I also wanted to honor my faith and be present with my people. The clock ticked louder, and I felt pulled in two directions, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give fully."}
