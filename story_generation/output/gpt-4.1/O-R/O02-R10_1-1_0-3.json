Today, during a brainstorming session, I noticed a colleague quietly skipping ahead in the queue to present their concept, bypassing the order we\u2019d agreed on. It was a small thing, but as a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to uphold dharma\u2014moral and ethical conduct\u2014even in the smallest matters. My mind started to churn. Should I speak up, risking the flow of our technical discussion and possibly creating tension? Or should I let it slide, telling myself it\u2019s just a minor breach and we can address process issues later? The expectation to keep the team focused and collaborative as an engineer clashed with my inner urge to stand up for fairness and honesty. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something different, and I sat there, torn, unsure which path to take."}
