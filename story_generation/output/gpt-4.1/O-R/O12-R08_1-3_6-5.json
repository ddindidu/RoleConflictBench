The QA team flagged a minor UI glitch\u2014nothing critical, but the product manager wanted it fixed before the weekend. I knew users could easily work around it, but the expectation was clear: fix it now. My phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014Friday prayer was about to start. I glanced down at my clothes, realizing I\u2019d rushed out this morning in jeans and a t-shirt, not the modest attire I usually wore for Jumu\u2019ah. The mosque was just across the street, and I could already hear the call to prayer echoing through the open window. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands: the team counting on me to resolve the issue, and my own commitment to dress appropriately for worship. I stared at the clock, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, unsure which expectation I would have to let down."}
