The main production unit had been down for half an hour, and every minute meant mounting losses. I grabbed my toolkit, mind already racing through possible causes\u2014faulty wiring, a misaligned sensor, maybe a software glitch. As I hurried toward the unit, my personal phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced at the screen: a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. \u201cCan you talk? It\u2019s urgent. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\u201d My heart clenched. She\u2019d been struggling for weeks, and I knew how much she needed someone to listen, to offer hope. But the factory\u2019s expectations pressed down on me\u2014get the line running, fix the problem, don\u2019t let the team down.
