The project manager\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cWe need a working prototype by next month, or we risk losing the funding.\u201d As the lead engineer, everyone was counting on me to deliver. My team looked to me for guidance, and the stakeholders were growing impatient. Every day, I felt the pressure mounting, the weight of responsibility pressing down on my shoulders.\n\nBut then, there was the letter from the hospital, the doctor\u2019s gentle but firm advice: \u201cIf you wish to perform Hajj, you should go this year. Your health may not allow it again.\u201d My heart ached. As a Muslim, performing Hajj was a lifelong dream, a sacred duty. My family was overjoyed at the possibility, urging me not to delay. Yet, the thought of leaving my team at such a critical moment filled me with guilt and anxiety. I stared at the calendar, torn between my commitment to my work and my faith, feeling the two worlds pulling me apart."}
