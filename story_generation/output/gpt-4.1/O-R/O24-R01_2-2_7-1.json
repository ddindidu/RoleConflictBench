The law was always shifting, and I was expected to keep pace, to ensure justice was served with the most current understanding.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. \u201cPastor, can we talk? I\u2019m facing something hard and need your guidance.\u201d I could hear the weight in her words, the expectation that I would be there, offering comfort and wisdom. As her pastor, I was supposed to help her find peace and clarity.\n\nI stared at the legal opinion, then at my phone, feeling the pressure build inside me. Both roles called to me, each with its own urgent need. I felt torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down\u2014either the law, or a soul in need."}
