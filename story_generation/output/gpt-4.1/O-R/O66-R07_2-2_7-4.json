They looked exhausted, and I could see the relief in their faces when I stepped out to help. \u201cCan you help us with the bags? We\u2019ll split the fare,\u201d one of them said, already opening the trunk. I glanced at the dashboard clock\u2014ten minutes until my weekly meditation group began. As a Buddhist, I promised myself to never miss these sessions, to practice mindfulness and nurture my inner peace. But as a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to be professional, helpful, and never turn away a fare, especially when people are in need. My hands gripped the handle of the suitcase, my mind torn between the duty to my passengers and the commitment to my spiritual practice. The weight of their luggage seemed lighter than the heaviness in my chest as I stood there, caught between the world\u2019s demands and my own search for stillness."}
