The clock on the dashboard glowed 9:45 a.m.\u2014fifteen minutes until the church service started. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss another Sunday, not after last week. But the roads were chaos: cars darted between lanes, brake lights flared, and puddles threatened to send my taxi skidding. My hands tightened on the wheel. As a driver, I knew I had to be cautious, obey every law, and keep my passengers safe, especially in weather like this. But as a Christian, I felt the weight of my commitment to worship, to be present with my community, to honor God with my time. Each red light, each slow-moving car, made my heart pound with frustration. Should I push a little harder, risk a quick lane change, just this once? Or should I accept being late, maybe missing the service altogether? The tension twisted inside me, the demands of my job and my faith pulling me in opposite directions as the rain kept falling."}
