As a judge, I know I must stay current\u2014my rulings depend on it. I glance at the clock, calculating how much time I can devote to reading before my next court session. Just then, the church door creaks open. A woman enters, her face streaked with tears, her hands trembling. She seeks me not as a judge, but as a priest, desperate for comfort and guidance in her moment of crisis. I feel the weight of her need pressing against the equally urgent demand of my judicial role. My mind races: if I turn her away, I fail my calling as a priest; if I stay, I risk falling behind in my legal responsibilities. The expectations of both roles pull at me, each insistent, each righteous. My heart aches with the impossibility of being fully present for both, and I stand frozen, torn between the law and the spirit, unable to move."}
