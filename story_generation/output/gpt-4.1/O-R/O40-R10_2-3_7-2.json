She sounded anxious, explaining that her elderly mother couldn\u2019t step outside safely. As a carpenter, I knew I had to get there quickly, assess the damage, and start repairs before the situation worsened. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. It was almost time for my daily puja, the sacred hour I set aside for prayers, chanting, and offerings. My family and I have always believed that skipping even a single ritual brings imbalance, and I\u2019ve never missed one, not even for work. The incense, the mantras, the peace I feel during those moments\u2014they\u2019re as essential to me as the tools in my workshop. Yet, Mrs. Sharma\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, her need urgent and real. I stood in my living room, torn between the call of my craft and the call of my faith, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me, unsure which path to take."}
