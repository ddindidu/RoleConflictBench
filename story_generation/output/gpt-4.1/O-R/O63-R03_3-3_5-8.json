My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe need every call, every sale, or we all lose out.\u201d I glance at the script, my fingers trembling, knowing that each call could be the one that tips us over the target. Yet, my heart aches with guilt. The bell for evening prayer rings through the convent halls, and I remember the Mother Superior\u2019s gentle request: \u201cSister, will you lead the reflections for our retreat? Your insight will guide us all.\u201d I am expected to prepare, to immerse myself in scripture, to be present for my sisters. But the pressure of the sales target claws at me, demanding my time and focus. I feel torn, my mind pulled between the relentless urgency of the call center and the quiet sanctuary of the chapel. I close my eyes, the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to follow as the clock ticks on."}
