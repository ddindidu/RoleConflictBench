The experiment I\u2019d been planning for weeks could finally be run tomorrow. The equipment was ready, the samples prepped, and my team was eager. As a scientist, I knew the importance of gathering data promptly, of not letting momentum slip. Yet, my phone vibrated with a reminder: Mrs. Evans, a longtime member of my congregation, was coming to see me at the same time. She\u2019d confided in me last Sunday, her voice trembling, about a struggle she could no longer bear alone. As her priest, I was expected to offer guidance, to be present and compassionate when she needed it most. The experiment could be rescheduled, but I worried about disappointing my colleagues. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t ignore the weight of Mrs. Evans\u2019s trust in me. My mind raced, torn between the sterile certainty of the lab and the sacred responsibility of the confessional, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
