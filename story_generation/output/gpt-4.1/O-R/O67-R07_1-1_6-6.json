My shift was nearly over, and I was supposed to deliver the vehicle to the satellite station for the next crew. The radio crackled, but it was my phone that buzzed insistently. It was Tenzin, my friend from the temple. He wanted to talk about the sermon we\u2019d heard last night\u2014about mindfulness, about being present, about letting go of worldly attachments. He said he needed my thoughts, my support, right now.\n\nI glanced at the dashboard clock. I was expected to arrive at the station on time, and I knew the rules: no distractions, no calls while driving, always put safety first. But Tenzin\u2019s voice in my mind was urgent, and as a Buddhist, I felt the pull to be there for him, to offer compassion and wisdom, to deepen my own understanding through discussion. My hands tightened on the wheel. The city\u2019s noise faded as I wrestled with the demands of the road and the call of the Dharma, torn between duty and devotion, unsure which path to follow."}
