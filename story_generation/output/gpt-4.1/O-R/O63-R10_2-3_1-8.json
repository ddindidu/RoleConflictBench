The temple bells in the distance reminded me why I\u2019d traveled so far\u2014today was the festival my family cherished, a day to honor our gods with rituals and offerings. My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, urging me to be present, to chant, to help with the puja. But my phone kept buzzing. My manager had sent a new list of prospects, and I was expected to call them all before noon. \n\nAs I dialed, the first customer asked about the technical details of our new service. The script barely scratched the surface, and I fumbled, trying to sound confident. Another call, another barrage of questions I couldn\u2019t fully answer.
