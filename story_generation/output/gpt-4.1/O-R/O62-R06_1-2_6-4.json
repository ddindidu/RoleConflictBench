It was Sunday morning, and the water sparkled with the laughter of children. I noticed a group of kids slipping into the shallow end, their parents chatting nearby, oblivious. My supervisor had been clear: no one in the pool without a lifeguard\u2019s supervision, especially in the shallow area. I was supposed to enforce the rules, keep everyone safe, and set an example.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014church service started in fifteen minutes. I\u2019d promised my pastor and myself that I\u2019d be there every week, to worship, to serve, to be part of the community that shaped my faith. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting down my duty as a lifeguard, risking the safety of those kids. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss church again, and the guilt of neglecting my spiritual life gnawed at me. My heart pounded as I watched the swimmers, torn between the whistle around my neck and the cross I wore beneath my shirt."}
