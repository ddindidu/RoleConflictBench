The numbers didn\u2019t add up, and the tax authority demanded an explanation by the end of the day. As an accountant, I knew the importance of accuracy and compliance\u2014one mistake could mean penalties for my client and a stain on my reputation. My mind raced through spreadsheets and receipts, searching for the missing piece.\n\nBut the call to prayer echoed from the mosque next door. As the imam, I was expected to lead the congregation, even if today the group was small and another worshipper could easily step in. The community looked to me for guidance and consistency, and I felt the weight of their trust.\n\nMy heart pounded as I glanced at the clock. If I left my desk now, I might miss the tax authority\u2019s deadline. If I stayed, I would disappoint those who counted on me for spiritual leadership. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. I closed my eyes, torn between duty and devotion, knowing I had to choose."}
