My radio crackled with updates, and I moved quickly, checking on shaken drivers, guiding paramedics, and keeping the crowd calm. As a police officer, I knew my duty was to protect everyone here, to keep order until the scene was safe. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a gentle reminder from the convent. Tonight, I was to lead the prayer vigil, a role I had been chosen for with great honor. The sisters and the community expected my presence, my voice guiding them in faith. I glanced at my watch; the vigil would begin soon. My heart pounded with the weight of both uniforms\u2014the badge on my chest and the habit I would wear later. I felt torn, the demands of the world and the call of the spirit pulling me in opposite directions. The accident scene needed me, but so did my sisters and the faithful waiting in the candlelit chapel. I stood at the crossroads, the sirens and church bells echoing in my mind, unsure which duty to answer first."}
