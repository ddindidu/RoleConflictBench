As a lifeguard, I was expected to check every detail before the swimmers arrived. This morning, I found a broken lane rope floating in the water, its frayed ends a clear hazard. Swim lessons would start in an hour, and if I didn\u2019t fix it, the kids could get tangled or the class might be canceled. My supervisor always stressed the importance of keeping the facility safe and ready.\n\nBut as I knelt by the pool, my thoughts drifted to my other role\u2014my faith. As a Muslim, I felt the growing pressure to save for Hajj. My parents reminded me often: it\u2019s a pillar of Islam, a duty I must fulfill when able. Yet, my lifeguard salary barely covered rent and groceries, let alone a trip to Mecca. Every time I spent money on pool supplies or extra shifts, I felt the weight of that unfulfilled obligation.\n\nNow, staring at the broken rope, I felt torn. Should I use my own savings to replace it quickly, as my job demanded, or keep saving for Hajj, as my faith required? The two roles pulled at me, each with its own urgency, and I stood there, heart pounding, caught between them."}
