My shift as a delivery person was almost over, and I had one last package\u2014a box of urgent medical supplies for the hospital\u2019s emergency department. The instructions were clear: deliver by 7:00 PM, no exceptions. I could already picture the nurses waiting, the patients depending on this delivery. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cLate deliveries can cost lives. Don\u2019t let us down.\u201d\n\nBut tonight was also special for me as a Muslim. I had planned a quiet evening at home, free from distractions, to recite and reflect on the Quran. It was something I rarely had time for, and I\u2019d been looking forward to it all week. The thought of sitting in peace, letting the verses wash over me, filled me with anticipation and a sense of spiritual longing.\n\nAs I navigated the city traffic, my heart pounded with anxiety. If I rushed, I might make the delivery on time, but I\u2019d arrive home exhausted, my mind too scattered for meaningful reflection. If I slowed down, I risked being late, letting down the hospital and my employer. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between duty to others and duty to my faith."}
