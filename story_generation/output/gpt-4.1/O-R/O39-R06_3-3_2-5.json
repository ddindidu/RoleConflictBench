The crane was lowering a massive steel beam, and I was one of the few strong enough to help guide it into place. My hands shook a little, not just from the weight of the work, but from the clock ticking in my mind. It was almost time for Sunday service, and I knew the pastor would notice if I wasn\u2019t there. My church family counted on me, not just to fill a seat, but to help with the youth group and lead the closing prayer. But here, on the site, my crew depended on me too. If I left now, the job would stall, and the beam could swing dangerously. I felt torn, my heart pounding with the weight of both expectations. I wanted to honor my faith, but I also didn\u2019t want to let my coworkers down. The crane\u2019s engine rumbled, and the foreman\u2019s voice grew urgent. I stood frozen, caught between the call of my faith and the demands of my work, unsure which duty I should answer."}
