The plant\u2019s operations were at risk\u2014if I didn\u2019t address the flagged issues by the end of the day, we\u2019d be forced to shut down. My phone buzzed. It was Maria from church, her voice trembling as she asked if I could meet. Her husband had just left, and she didn\u2019t know how to face her children. She needed someone to listen, to pray, to help her find hope. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. As an engineer, I was expected to act decisively, to ensure every standard was met, to keep everyone safe. As a pastor, I was called to be present, to offer comfort and guidance in moments of crisis. I could hear the urgency in Maria\u2019s voice, but I could also see the inspector\u2019s stern warning in my inbox. My heart pounded as I tried to reconcile the impossible demands, torn between the safety of many and the pain of one."}
