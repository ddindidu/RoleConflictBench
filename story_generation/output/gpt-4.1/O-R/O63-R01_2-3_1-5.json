The customer\u2019s confusion was clear, and I felt the familiar frustration of not having the answers they needed. My supervisor expected me to keep the call moving, to stick to the script, but I wanted to help, to listen, to offer more than rehearsed lines. As I glanced at my phone, a message flashed from a church member: \u201cPastor, we need you. The Johnsons lost their home in the flood. Can you come?\u201d My heart twisted. My congregation needed comfort, guidance, and immediate support. But here I was, tethered to my headset, expected to be efficient and persuasive, not compassionate and present. The demands of both worlds pressed in on me, each urgent, each important, and I felt myself pulled apart, uncertain which voice to answer first."}
