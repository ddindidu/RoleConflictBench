As a nursing assistant, I know how important it is to keep everything on schedule\u2014missing a reading could mean missing a sign of trouble. I was just about to check Mrs. Lee\u2019s blood pressure when I noticed Mr. Carter, a member of my congregation, sitting alone by the window, his shoulders slumped. He looked up, eyes red-rimmed, and I could see he was struggling. The pastor in me wanted to sit beside him, offer a prayer or a listening ear, to be present for him in his pain. But the nurse in me felt the weight of the ticking clock, the expectation to finish my rounds, to not let my team down. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my duty to care for my patients\u2019 bodies, and my calling to care for their souls. I stood in the hallway, torn, the demands of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which to answer first."}
