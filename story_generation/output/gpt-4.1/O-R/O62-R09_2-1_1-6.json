It was almost time for the afternoon synagogue service, and I could already picture the familiar faces gathering, the soft hum of prayers beginning. My phone buzzed with a reminder, and a pang of guilt twisted in my chest. I knew my community valued my presence, even if the minyan would be complete without me. But here, at the pool, my responsibility was immediate\u2014every splash, every shout, every swimmer depended on my vigilance. Suddenly, I noticed a young boy in the middle of the pool, his strokes faltering, head bobbing awkwardly. My heart raced. I couldn\u2019t look away, couldn\u2019t leave my post, but the thought of missing the service gnawed at me. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my full attention, each with its own sense of duty and belonging."}
