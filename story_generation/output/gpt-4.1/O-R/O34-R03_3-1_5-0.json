The voice of a pilot crackles through, tense and urgent\u2014he\u2019s low on fuel, needs immediate vectors. My training kicks in, every muscle taut with focus. I know lives depend on my calm, precise instructions. But as I guide him, my phone vibrates in my pocket. It\u2019s a reminder: the food drive at the convent starts in ten minutes. Sister Agnes and the others are counting on me to help serve meals to the homeless, to be present in our community\u2019s hour of need.
