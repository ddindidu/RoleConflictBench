My training as a subway operator kicked in: I needed to stop the train at the next station, alert security, and keep everyone calm. My heart pounded, knowing that every second mattered for passenger safety. But as I reached for the radio, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee. The backup imam was unexpectedly absent, and the congregation was gathering, waiting for me to lead the prayer. I could picture the expectant faces, the trust they placed in me to guide them in worship, especially on a day like this. Torn between my duty to protect hundreds of commuters and my responsibility to my community\u2019s faith, I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me. The train slowed, the mosque clock ticked, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds that needed me at the very same moment."}
