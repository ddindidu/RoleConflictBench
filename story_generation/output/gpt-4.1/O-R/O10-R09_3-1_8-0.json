As the company\u2019s accountant, it was my job to handle these tense situations\u2014communicate, negotiate, and keep the business running smoothly. The supplier\u2019s threat was clear: pay the overdue invoice or risk losing a crucial partnership. My boss expected a quick resolution, and I knew I needed to call the supplier immediately to prevent disaster.\n\nBut tonight was also the weekly study session I\u2019d promised my children. As a Jewish parent, I felt a deep responsibility to teach them about our traditions and values, to pass on the stories and lessons that shaped my own childhood. They looked forward to these evenings, and so did I. I could reschedule, but I worried about what message that would send\u2014about priorities, about commitment to our heritage.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder for both the supplier call and the study session. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between my professional duty and my role as a parent and teacher. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
