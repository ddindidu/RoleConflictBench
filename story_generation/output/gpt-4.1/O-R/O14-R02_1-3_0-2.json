The experiment I\u2019d designed for months was finally ready, and the equipment was available for a rare, uninterrupted block of time. I could run the tests now, gather the data, and maybe even get ahead on my research. But as I glanced at my phone, a reminder flashed: the most significant religious holiday of the year was tomorrow. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, offer guidance, and be present for everyone who would fill the sanctuary. They counted on me for comfort and tradition, especially on this day. My colleagues, meanwhile, expected dedication to the pursuit of knowledge, to seize every opportunity for discovery. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding my presence in the lab, the other in the chapel. My mind raced, torn between the quiet hum of scientific inquiry and the solemn chorus of prayer, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
