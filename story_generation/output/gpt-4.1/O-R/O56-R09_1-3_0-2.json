She beams at me, expecting the warm greeting and easy banter I always offer. The receptionist is free, but Mrs. Goldstein always prefers to chat with me, and I know she looks forward to these moments. I force a smile, but my mind is elsewhere\u2014my son\u2019s bar mitzvah is only weeks away, and he\u2019s still struggling with his Torah portion. I promised him we\u2019d practice together tonight, but I\u2019m already running late, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about the responsibility I carry to guide him through this important milestone. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: the expectation to be present and welcoming for my clients, and the deeper, more personal duty to my son and our faith. As Mrs. Goldstein approaches, I feel my heart tug in two directions, unsure which role needs me more in this moment."}
