Major accident, possible injuries.\u201d My heart skipped. I glanced at the clock\u2014forty minutes until David\u2019s bar mitzvah, a ceremony I\u2019d promised his family I would lead, a moment he\u2019d prepared for all year. But the dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent, and I could already picture the chaos: twisted metal, frightened faces, the expectation that I would bring order and safety. \n\nAs I slid into my patrol car, my phone buzzed with a message from David\u2019s mother: \u201cWe\u2019re so grateful you\u2019ll be there for David\u2019s big day.\u201d The weight of my badge pressed against my chest, a reminder of my duty to protect.
