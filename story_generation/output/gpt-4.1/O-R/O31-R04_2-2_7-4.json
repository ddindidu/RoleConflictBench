As a police officer, I was expected to remain calm, impartial, and thorough\u2014collecting statements, reviewing the scene, and ensuring both parties felt heard. My radio crackled with updates, but my mind was elsewhere. Today was Friday, and I was also the imam, scheduled to deliver the sermon at noon. The community had been looking forward to my khutbah, and I knew how much preparation and presence it required. The mosque committee had publicized my topic, and families would be gathering soon, expecting guidance and inspiration. I glanced at my watch, feeling the minutes slip away. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me\u2014one demanding justice and order, the other spiritual leadership and compassion. My heart pounded as I realized I could not fulfill both duties at once. The drivers waited for my decision, and the congregation waited for my words. I stood at the crossroads of my two worlds, torn by the expectations that defined me."}
