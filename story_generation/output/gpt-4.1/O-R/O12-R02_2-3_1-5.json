I knew the new feature was almost done, but the code wasn\u2019t as clean as it should be. My mind raced with solutions, ways to optimize, to meet the team\u2019s expectations for quality and efficiency. I was about to dive back in when my phone buzzed. It was the church secretary: someone had arrived, desperate, in tears, needing spiritual guidance right now. My heart clenched. As a priest, I was expected to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and hope in moments of crisis. But as a developer, I was expected to deliver reliable, maintainable code\u2014on time.
