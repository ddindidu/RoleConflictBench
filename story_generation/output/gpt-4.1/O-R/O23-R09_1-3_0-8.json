My client had sent it early, and there was no rush\u2014plenty of time to review, annotate, and send it back. Still, I felt the usual tug of responsibility; as a lawyer, I prided myself on being thorough and prompt, never letting a document sit untouched. Just as I began to read, my phone buzzed. It was David from the synagogue. There was a funeral prayer in an hour, and they were one person short for the minyan. Without me, the prayer couldn\u2019t happen, and the grieving family would be left waiting, unable to say Kaddish for their loved one. I stared at the contract, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My professional self urged me to stay, to get ahead on my work, to be the reliable lawyer my clients expected. But my Jewish self felt the pull of community, of tradition, of not letting others down in their moment of need. The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, torn between two duties that both felt essential."}
