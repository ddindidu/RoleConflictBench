She\u2019d been especially quiet today, her eyes searching mine for comfort as I listened to her stories of a life now mostly lived in memories. As a nursing assistant, I knew my presence mattered\u2014sometimes more than any medication. But my phone buzzed again, a reminder from the parish secretary: the Johnsons needed me to lead their child\u2019s final sacrament preparation session, and it had to be today. As a priest, I was expected to guide families through these sacred milestones, to be present and prepared, especially for something so important. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014Mrs. Evans needed me to stay, to be her companion in this lonely hour, but the Johnsons and their child needed me to fulfill my spiritual duty. My heart ached as I tried to decide where I was needed most, torn between the comfort I could offer one soul and the guidance I owed to another."}
