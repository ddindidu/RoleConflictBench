The supervisor had emphasized the importance of today\u2019s session\u2014new operational procedures, mandatory attendance, no exceptions. My colleagues gathered around the table, chatting and helping themselves to the catered breakfast. The aroma of warm pastries and egg sandwiches filled the air, but as I scanned the spread, my heart sank. None of the food was kosher, and there was no time to leave and find something else. My stomach grumbled, but the thought of breaking my dietary laws gnawed at me even more. I felt the weight of expectation from both sides: my duty to be alert and focused for the briefing, and my commitment to my faith. The supervisor called everyone to take their seats, and I hesitated, torn between the need to eat so I could perform my job well and the need to honor my religious practice. The room grew quiet, and I could feel eyes on me as I stood there, wrestling with what to do next."}
