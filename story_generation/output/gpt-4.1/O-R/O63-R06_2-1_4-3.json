My sales manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cYou need to hit your target this week, or we\u2019ll have to talk.\u201d I stared at the list of numbers, knowing I was still three sales short. My fingers hovered over the phone, but my heart wasn\u2019t in it. Sunday worship was starting soon, and I hadn\u2019t been in weeks. I missed the warmth of the congregation, the peace I felt singing hymns, and the sense of belonging. My faith taught me to honor God and keep the Sabbath, but my job demanded results, numbers, and relentless calls. I felt torn\u2014if I stayed and kept dialing, maybe I\u2019d keep my job, but I\u2019d miss another chance to reconnect with my faith and community.
