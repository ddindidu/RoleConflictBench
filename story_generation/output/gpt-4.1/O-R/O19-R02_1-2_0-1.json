The label matched the medication, but I paused, my mind drifting to the church bell that would soon ring. Today was the main weekly service, the one where the pews would be full and my congregation would look to me for guidance and comfort. I glanced at the clock\u2014if I left now, I could just make it. But the pharmacy was busy, and my technician was out sick. The line of patients waiting for their medications grew longer, and I knew each one depended on me to dispense their prescriptions accurately and safely. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cService begins in 20 minutes.\u201d I felt the weight of both white collar and white coat pressing on my shoulders, torn between the duty to my patients and the spiritual needs of my community. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which role I could let down less."}
