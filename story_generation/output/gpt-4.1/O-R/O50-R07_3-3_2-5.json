The nurse\u2019s voice still rang in my ears: \u201cThe ventilator\u2019s down. We need you now.\u201d My mind raced through possible faults, each more urgent than the last. As a machine repairer, I knew every second counted\u2014someone\u2019s life depended on my skill and speed. But as I reached the door, my phone buzzed. A gentle reminder: \u201cGroup meditation, 10 minutes. You\u2019re leading.\u201d I pictured the circle of calm faces waiting for me, expecting guidance, stillness, and presence. My heart pounded, torn between the desperate need in the ICU and the quiet sanctuary of the meditation room. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding immediate action, the other asking for mindful stillness. My hands trembled, caught between the tools I carried and the silence I was meant to offer."}
