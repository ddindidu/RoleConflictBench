I smiled, welcoming them, offering tea, and assuring them everything would run smoothly. My hands moved automatically, sectioning hair, smoothing curls, but my mind kept drifting. My Buddhist teacher had asked me to summarize the Four Noble Truths for tomorrow\u2019s temple session\u2014a rare honor, and one I\u2019d promised to prepare for with deep reflection. Yet here I was, surrounded by hairspray and chatter, my spiritual notes untouched in my bag. The bride\u2019s mother asked for reassurance, and I gave it, but inside I felt the tension mounting. I wanted to be fully present for these women on their special day, but I also longed for the quiet of my altar, the chance to study and contemplate. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, uncertain which path to follow."}
