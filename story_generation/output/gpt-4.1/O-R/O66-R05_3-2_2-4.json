My passenger, a nervous businessman, kept glancing at his watch and muttering about missing his international flight. I could feel his anxiety radiating from the back seat, and I knew he expected me to get him to the airport on time, no matter the weather. But as I gripped the wheel, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the children\u2019s Torah class at the synagogue was starting in less than an hour. As their rabbi, I was expected to be there, to guide them through the week\u2019s lesson, to answer their questions, to be a steady presence in their lives. The storm was making everything uncertain. If I took the long, slow route to the airport, I\u2019d miss the class. If I rushed, I\u2019d risk everyone\u2019s safety. My heart pounded as I weighed the responsibility of my passenger\u2019s urgent need against the commitment I\u2019d made to my students. The city lights blurred in the snow, and I felt pulled in two directions, each demanding more than I could give."}
