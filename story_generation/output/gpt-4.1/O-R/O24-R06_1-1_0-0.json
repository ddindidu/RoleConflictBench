As a judge, I was expected to review every detail, even for a simple procedural matter like this one. The law demanded diligence, impartiality, and a clear mind. Yet, as I flipped through the first few pages, I noticed a detail that tugged at my conscience\u2014a minor procedural error that, if left unaddressed, could disadvantage one of the parties, a young woman who reminded me of the parable of the Good Samaritan. My Christian faith urged me to act with compassion and fairness, to ensure that justice was not just done, but seen to be done in the spirit of mercy. But the rules were clear: my role was not to advocate, but to adjudicate. The pressure of these two worlds pressed in on me, the expectation to uphold the law without bias clashing with my desire to live out my faith\u2019s call to kindness and justice. I stared at the file, heart pounding, torn between the letter of the law and the spirit of my beliefs, unsure which path to follow."}
