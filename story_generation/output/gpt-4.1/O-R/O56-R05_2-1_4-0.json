My heart sank. As a hairdresser, I knew I had to listen, reassure her, and offer a solution\u2014client satisfaction was everything. But as she spoke, my phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: \u201cBegin sermon prep for Shabbat.\u201d The High Holidays were approaching, and as the community\u2019s rabbi, I was expected to deliver a message that would inspire and comfort, something I hadn\u2019t even started thinking about. My mind raced with possible sermon themes\u2014renewal, forgiveness, hope\u2014while Miriam waited for my response, her disappointment growing. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: the need to be present and attentive for Miriam, and the responsibility to my congregation, who counted on me for spiritual guidance.
