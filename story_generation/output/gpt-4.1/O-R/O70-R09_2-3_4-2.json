I rang the bell, shifting my weight from foot to foot, thinking about the time. My son\u2019s bar mitzvah was only a week away, and he still stumbled over the Torah portion. I\u2019d promised to help him tonight, to sit with him and practice, to explain the meaning behind the words, just as my father had done for me. But the route was running late, and this customer was taking forever to answer. My phone buzzed with another delivery notification. I felt the pressure from my supervisor to keep up the pace, to secure every package, to get every signature. But my mind kept drifting to my son, to the expectation that I would guide him, teach him, be present for this milestone. The door finally opened, and I forced a smile, pen ready, heart heavy, torn between the demands of my job and the responsibility I felt as a Jewish parent."}
