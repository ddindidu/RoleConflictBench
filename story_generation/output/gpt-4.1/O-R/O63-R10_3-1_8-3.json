My headset itched against my ear as I listened to the customer\u2019s voice drone on, but my attention was caught by a commotion near the coffee machine. Through the glass, I saw a colleague slip ahead of another in the break queue, pretending not to notice the frown on the woman he\u2019d just bypassed. My heart twinged. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act with honesty and fairness, even in small matters. But the automated compliance system was ruthless; if I left my desk even a minute early, I\u2019d be flagged, and another warning could mean a formal write-up. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo unscheduled downtime, not even for a second.\u201d Yet, the urge to quietly point out the unfairness tugged at me. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the rules of my job and the values I\u2019d grown up with, feeling the weight of both pressing down on me as the seconds ticked away."}
