Most callers today have been polite, and the script covers their concerns easily. Still, I feel the tension in my shoulders, the constant need to be persuasive, to keep my numbers up. My supervisor expects me to stay on the line, to never let a potential sale slip away. But as I glance at the clock, I remember that in just fifteen minutes, I\u2019m supposed to lead the weekly group meditation at the temple. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to be calm, present, and mindful, to guide others into stillness. My mind races\u2014should I log off early and risk disappointing my boss, or stay and risk letting down my sangha? The demands of both roles press in on me, and I feel my breath catch, torn between the world of sales and the world of silence."}
