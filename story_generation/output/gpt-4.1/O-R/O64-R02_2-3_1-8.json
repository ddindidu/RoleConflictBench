The line snakes past the candy racks, customers shifting impatiently, eyes flicking to their watches. My manager expects speed and accuracy\u2014no mistakes, no delays. But my phone vibrates in my pocket, a message from the Martinez family. Their daughter\u2019s sacrament is this weekend, and they need me to lead a final preparation session tonight. It\u2019s the only time they can all be together, and as their priest, I know how much this means to them. I glance at the clock; my shift won\u2019t end for another two hours, and the store is short-staffed. My mind races, torn between the duty to my employer and the spiritual responsibility to my parishioners. I feel the weight of both uniforms\u2014the apron and the collar\u2014pressing on my shoulders, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. The next customer steps forward, and I force a smile, my heart pounding as I wrestle with what I must do next."}
