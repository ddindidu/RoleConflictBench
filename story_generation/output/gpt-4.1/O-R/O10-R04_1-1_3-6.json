There\u2019s a seminar this afternoon about upcoming changes\u2014missing it could mean falling behind, risking mistakes that would let down my clients and my own professional standards. But as an imam, I also carry the trust of my community. Just this morning, Sister Amina mentioned she\u2019s been struggling and would appreciate some time to talk, \u201cwhenever I\u2019m free.\u201d Her words linger with me, heavy with unspoken need. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in: the duty to my profession, to accuracy and compliance, and the duty to my faith, to compassion and guidance. My mind races, torn between the seminar\u2019s importance and the quiet plea for help. I glance at the clock, heart pounding, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
