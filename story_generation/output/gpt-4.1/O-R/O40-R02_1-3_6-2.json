I wanted to help\u2014repairing cherished things is why I became a carpenter. But as I reached for my notebook to jot down a quote, my phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was the festival\u2019s eve, the holiest night of the year. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, to be present for every family, every soul seeking comfort and blessing. The congregation would be waiting, counting on me to guide them. My hands trembled, torn between the quiet satisfaction of mending a child\u2019s joy and the sacred duty of shepherding my flock. Both roles demanded my presence, my heart, and my time. I stared at the broken toy, the prayer book on my desk, and felt the weight of impossible expectations pressing in from both sides."}
