The defendant\u2019s anxious face flashes before me; the law requires clarity and precision, and I must draft the order for his release without delay. The expectation is clear: justice cannot wait, and my words must be exact, leaving no room for ambiguity. Yet, my phone vibrates softly\u2014a reminder of my own promise to myself. Ten minutes, just ten minutes of stillness, to breathe, to let go, to practice the mindfulness that has become my anchor in the storm of daily judgments. The robe I wear as a judge feels heavy, stitched with the weight of responsibility. The cushion in the corner of my office beckons, promising peace. My mind tugs in two directions: the urgency of the law, the necessity of compassion for myself. I close my eyes for a moment, feeling the tension coil in my chest, the demands of justice and the call of inner peace wrestling within me."}
