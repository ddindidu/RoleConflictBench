My client\u2019s hearing was tomorrow, and I\u2019d spent the afternoon preparing arguments, my mind racing with case law and strategy. Now, at this communal dinner, I was expected to network, to show my face and build trust with colleagues and potential clients. Plates were passed, laughter echoing, but as I looked down, I saw nothing with a kosher symbol. I felt the weight of expectation\u2014my community, my family, my own sense of faith\u2014pressing against the professional mask I wore. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice reminding me of the rules, the meaning behind them. Yet, declining the food would draw attention, maybe even offend the hosts, and I needed these connections for my client\u2019s sake. My stomach tightened, not just from hunger, but from the tension between my roles. I gripped my fork, caught between the demands of my profession and the quiet, persistent call of my faith, unsure which would win out as the first dish was set before me."}
