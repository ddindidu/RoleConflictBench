Today, a temporary restraining order has just been filed, and the law demands I read, analyze, and rule within the hour. The pressure is immense; every detail could change a life. Yet, as a practicing Hindu, I am also expected to perform my daily rituals\u2014lighting a lamp, offering flowers, and chanting prayers. Lately, I\u2019ve only managed to quietly repeat a short mantra at my desk, feeling guilty for not honoring the full ritual. Now, as I scan the urgent legal documents, my mind drifts to the small altar at home, untouched this morning. The weight of my robe feels heavier, as if the expectations of justice and faith are pulling me in opposite directions. My heart aches with the knowledge that, in fulfilling one duty, I am neglecting the other. The clock ticks louder, echoing my inner turmoil, as I wrestle with which role to honor in this moment."}
