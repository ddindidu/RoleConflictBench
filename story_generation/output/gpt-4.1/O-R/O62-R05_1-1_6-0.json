The sun beat down, and the laughter of children echoed off the water. I noticed a group of kids slipping into the shallow end, unsupervised. My training screamed at me\u2014enforce the rules, keep everyone safe. I was responsible for their well-being, and any lapse could have serious consequences. But as I watched, my mind drifted to my other calling. Shabbat was approaching, and I needed to start preparing my sermon. The congregation expected inspiration, guidance, and wisdom. I felt the weight of their anticipation, the need to offer something meaningful. My notebook sat unopened in my bag, ideas swirling but unformed. I felt torn\u2014should I focus on the immediate safety of the swimmers, or allow myself a moment to jot down the beginnings of a sermon that could touch lives? The demands of both roles pressed in, each urgent in its own way, and I sat there, heart pounding, caught between the pool and the pulpit."}
