Chants grew louder, faces flushed with anger, and I knew my duty: keep the peace, enforce the law, no matter how tense it became. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from the mosque. Tonight was the study circle, the one I\u2019d promised to attend, where we\u2019d reflect on verses I hadn\u2019t yet read. My imam had encouraged me to come prepared, to deepen my understanding and connection with Allah. But here I was, heart pounding, torn between the chaos before me and the quiet reflection I craved. The expectation to be present, to recite and learn, pressed against the urgent need to control the crowd. I felt the pull of both worlds, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. The voices around me blurred with the verses echoing in my mind, and I stood frozen, caught between duty and devotion, unsure which call to answer first."}
