The supervisor\u2019s voice echoed down the hall, calling everyone to the mandatory pre-shift briefing. Today, they were rolling out new operational procedures, and attendance was non-negotiable. I knew how important it was to be present, to show professionalism, to absorb every detail that could affect the safety of thousands of passengers.\n\nBut my stomach twisted with hunger. I\u2019d been traveling since dawn, and the only kosher-certified vendor nearby was about to close for the afternoon. If I missed this narrow window, I\u2019d have nothing to eat until late tonight, breaking my commitment to observe kosher dietary laws. The expectation from my faith was clear: I should make every effort to eat properly, even when it\u2019s inconvenient.\n\nI stood in the hallway, torn. The supervisor\u2019s voice grew sharper, urging us to hurry. My phone buzzed with a reminder about the vendor\u2019s closing time. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to let down."}
