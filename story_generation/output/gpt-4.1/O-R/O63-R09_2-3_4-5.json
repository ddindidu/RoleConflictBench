My manager\u2019s reminders echoed in my head: \u201cWe need those numbers, every call counts.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my mind kept drifting to the communal event tonight. The invitation had promised a generous spread, but I\u2019d just learned the food wasn\u2019t kosher-certified. My stomach tightened. I could try to find something else to eat, but it would be awkward, maybe even disrespectful to the hosts. Yet, eating non-kosher food wasn\u2019t an option for me. \n\nI stared at my phone, torn. If I stayed late to make more calls, I\u2019d miss the event entirely. If I left on time, I\u2019d face the awkwardness of refusing the food or breaking my own rules. The pressure to meet my sales target pressed against the weight of my commitment to my faith. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my mind racing, caught between the demands of my job and the expectations of my tradition."}
