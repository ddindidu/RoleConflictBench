The customer\u2019s groceries sat in the back seat, and the app flashed a reminder: \u201cDeliver by 1:00 PM.\u201d I knew how important this was; the customer had messaged me twice, saying they needed the food for a family dinner. My route took me right past the mosque, and as I pulled up, the call to prayer echoed from the loudspeakers. It was Friday, the most important prayer of the week, and I had promised myself never to miss it. I parked, grabbed my prayer mat, and reached for my abaya, but realized I\u2019d left it at home in my rush. My delivery uniform was clean but short-sleeved and not as modest as I would usually wear in the prayer hall. I hesitated, feeling the weight of both roles pressing on me: the customer counting on me for their meal, and my own commitment to worship and modesty. My heart pounded as I stood between the mosque doors and my car, torn by the expectations of my faith and my job, unsure which duty to fulfill first."}
