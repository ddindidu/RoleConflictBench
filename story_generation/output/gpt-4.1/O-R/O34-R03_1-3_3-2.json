My fingers hovered over the console, ready to respond, as I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift was only halfway through. Yet my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes: \u201cThe mayor needs us. Hundreds are homeless. Can you help organize the relief?\u201d My heart twisted. As an air traffic controller, I was the lifeline for pilots, responsible for their safety, every instruction critical.
