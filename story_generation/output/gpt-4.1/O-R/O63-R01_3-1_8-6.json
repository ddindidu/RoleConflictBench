My headset itched against my ear as I wrapped up a call, careful not to let my voice betray the fatigue I felt. The compliance system was always watching\u2014one unscheduled minute away from my desk, and I\u2019d get flagged. Yet, as I ended the call, a colleague from the community center poked her head into my cubicle, her eyes bright. \u201cPastor, could you share that story about forgiveness you told last Sunday? The group\u2019s gathered in the lounge.\u201d\n\nMy heart tugged in two directions. As a pastor, I knew how much these moments mattered\u2014teaching, guiding, offering comfort. But as a telemarketer, I was bound by the rigid schedule, every second accounted for. If I left my desk now, even for a few minutes, the system would log my absence. I could almost hear the automated email arriving, warning me about compliance. Yet, the expectation to be present for my community, to share faith and wisdom, pressed just as urgently. I sat frozen, headset in hand, torn between the demands of my job and my calling, unsure which voice to heed."}
