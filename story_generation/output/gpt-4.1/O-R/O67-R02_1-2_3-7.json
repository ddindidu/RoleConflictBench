As an ambulance driver, I knew how crucial it was to be prepared\u2014lives depended on it. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen. It was a reminder: the children\u2019s religious education class was starting in fifteen minutes. As the parish priest, I was expected to lead the lesson, to guide young minds in faith and answer their questions with patience and care. I could almost hear their voices echoing in the church hall, waiting for me.\n\nBut here I was, surrounded by medical supplies, knowing that if I left now, I might miss a critical detail that could cost someone dearly later. Yet if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down the children and their families, who trusted me to nurture their spiritual growth.

My hands trembled as I held a roll of gauze, torn between the call to heal bodies and the call to heal souls, uncertain which duty I should answer first."}
