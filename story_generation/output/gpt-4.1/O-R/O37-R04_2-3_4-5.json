She trusted me to keep her home spotless, and I knew she expected me to manage the supplies, never letting anything run out. The next cleaning was in three days, and if I didn\u2019t get more cleaner, I\u2019d be letting her down. But as I made a mental note to pick some up, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the Friday sermon. This week was special\u2014our community was celebrating the completion of the new prayer hall, and people were coming from neighboring towns just to hear my khutbah. The committee had asked me to prepare something meaningful, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing on me. I wanted to give them my best, but my mind kept drifting back to the supply list and the errands I needed to run. I felt torn, pulled between my duty to the families I cleaned for and my responsibility to my congregation. The pressure built inside me, and I wondered how I could possibly meet everyone\u2019s expectations at once."}
