As a lifeguard, I knew this was serious\u2014if I didn\u2019t act fast, swimmers could get sick or worse. I needed to call maintenance, maybe even close the pool until it was fixed. But as I glanced at my watch, I remembered I was supposed to teach the kids at the synagogue in less than an hour. It was our weekly study slot, and I\u2019d promised their parents I\u2019d help the children connect with their heritage, learn the prayers, and understand our traditions. I could reschedule the lesson, but I hated to let the kids down; they looked forward to our time together, and I felt responsible for nurturing their Jewish identity. My mind raced, torn between my duty to keep the pool safe and my commitment to the children. Both roles mattered deeply to me, and both demanded my presence right now. I stood by the pool, heart pounding, trying to figure out what to do next."}
