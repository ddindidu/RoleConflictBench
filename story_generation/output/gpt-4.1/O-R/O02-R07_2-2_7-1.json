The project\u2019s timeline depends on me, and I know the team is waiting for my input before they can move forward. My inbox pings again, this time a gentle message from the temple: \u201cMemorial service tonight. Your presence is important for the community.\u201d I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. As an engineer, I\u2019m expected to be logical, dependable, and available for the team. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m called to be present, compassionate, and supportive, especially during rituals that honor those who have passed. The clock ticks louder.
