The sun glints off the water, and I watch as a few kids drift toward the deep end, not in trouble, but close enough to keep me alert. My supervisor expects unwavering attention\u2014no distractions, no exceptions. But my phone buzzes with a reminder: the holiday is almost here, and I promised the kids at Hebrew school I\u2019d help them learn the blessings. Their parents count on me to pass on our traditions, to make sure the children know the words and the meaning behind them. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in. If I take a moment to review the blessings or send a quick message to the parents, I risk missing something at the pool. But if I wait, the kids might not be ready in time for the holiday. My mind races, torn between the safety of the swimmers and the responsibility to my community, both demanding my full attention, both unwilling to wait."}
