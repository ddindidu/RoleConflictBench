As a judge, I know the weight of my responsibility\u2014every detail must be reviewed, every argument considered. The parties expect fairness, diligence, and a mind undistracted by anything else.

My doctor\u2019s words echo in my mind\u2014this may be my last chance to fulfill this pillar of my faith, given my health. The expectation from my faith is clear: if I am able, I must go. My family\u2019s hopeful faces flash before me, urging me to seize this opportunity. But the files on my desk demand my attention, and the court expects me to be present, prepared, and impartial. My heart pounds as I stare at the clock, torn between my duty to the law and my duty to God, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
