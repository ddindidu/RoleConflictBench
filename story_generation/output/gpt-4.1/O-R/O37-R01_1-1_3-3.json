She\u2019d been quieter than usual lately, and I\u2019d heard from others at church that she was struggling. As a housekeeping cleaner, I needed to finish the inventory\u2014my supervisor expected a full report by noon, and I\u2019d already noticed we were low on disinfectant. But as a pastor, I felt a tug in my chest, a responsibility to offer comfort, even if it was just a gentle word or a listening ear. My mind raced with the list of supplies I still had to check, but my heart ached for Mrs. Lee, knowing how much a simple conversation could mean. I stood there, torn between the demands of my job and the calling of my faith, the weight of both roles pressing in on me as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first."}
