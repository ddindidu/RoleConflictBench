As a lifeguard, I knew I had to enforce the rules\u2014no exceptions. My supervisor had made it clear: safety comes first, and letting things slide could cost someone dearly. But as I glanced at my watch, my heart tightened. Sunday service was about to start, and I\u2019d promised my church group I\u2019d be there to help set up. My faith was my anchor, and being present at worship was more than a routine; it was a commitment to my beliefs and my community. The tension inside me grew as the teens edged closer to the water, their laughter echoing. I felt torn, pulled between my duty to protect these kids and my responsibility to honor my faith. The minutes ticked by, and I wrestled with the weight of both roles, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy the demands of each at this moment."}
