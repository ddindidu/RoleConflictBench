A passenger needed help\u2014medical, urgent. My training as a subway operator kicked in: I had to stop the train, alert the control center, and assist until paramedics arrived. Every second mattered for the person in distress. But tonight was also the weekly Buddhist study circle, the one evening I set aside for spiritual reflection and learning with my sangha. We were finally discussing a chapter I\u2019d been waiting for, one that promised insight into letting go of attachment and embracing compassion. My phone buzzed with reminders from the group, their gentle encouragements echoing the teachings I tried to live by. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to the passengers, my commitment to my spiritual path. The train slowed, my hands trembling on the controls, torn between the immediate needs before me and the quiet call of the Dharma."}
