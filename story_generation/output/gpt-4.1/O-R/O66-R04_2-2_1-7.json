My train leaves in twenty minutes,\u201d he pleaded, eyes darting between me and the traffic ahead. As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get him to the station safely and on time, but the city was thick with evening congestion. My hands tightened on the wheel, calculating shortcuts and risks, feeling the pressure to deliver him quickly.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from Brother Ahmed, a devoted member of my congregation. \u201cImam, I really need to talk. Can you meet soon? It\u2019s urgent\u2014my family is falling apart.\u201d I could sense the desperation in his words. As an imam, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and guidance, especially in moments of crisis.\n\nCaught between the demands of my passenger\u2019s urgency and my congregant\u2019s plea, I felt a knot form in my chest. Both needed me, both counted on me, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My mind raced, torn between the road ahead and the call for help waiting on my phone."}
