The dosage was complex, the margin for error nonexistent. My mind replayed the pharmacist\u2019s oath: accuracy, safety, vigilance. The patient\u2019s life depended on my focus. Yet, my phone buzzed with reminders\u2014tonight was the High Holiday service. As the rabbi, I was expected to deliver a sermon that would inspire and guide my entire congregation. They looked to me for wisdom, especially on this sacred night. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock. If I stayed to ensure every detail of the prescription was perfect, I\u2019d risk being late for the service.
