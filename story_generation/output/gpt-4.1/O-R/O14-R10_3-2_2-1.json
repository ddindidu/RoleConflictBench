The atmospheric conditions were finally perfect\u2014something we\u2019d waited months for. My team looked to me, the lead scientist, to begin the experiment that could make or break our research funding. Every minute counted; the data we\u2019d gather today might be the key to our future.\n\nBut as I reached for my lab coat, my phone chimed with a gentle reminder: it was time for my daily puja. As a Hindu, I\u2019d promised myself never to skip lighting the lamp and offering prayers at my home altar, no matter how busy life became. My mother\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cRituals keep us grounded, especially when life is uncertain.\u201d\n\nYet, the clock was ticking. If I left now, I\u2019d miss the narrow window for the experiment. If I stayed, I\u2019d break my spiritual commitment. My colleagues expected unwavering dedication to science; my family and faith expected devotion to ritual. I stood frozen, heart pounding, torn between the two worlds that defined me, unable to move toward either."}
