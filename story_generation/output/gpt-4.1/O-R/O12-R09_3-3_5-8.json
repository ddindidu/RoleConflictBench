The architects from the other teams were waiting for my input on the new feature design, and the launch date had just been moved up. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need your decisions today, or the whole project is blocked.\u201d I could feel the pressure mounting, knowing how many people were depending on me to keep things moving.\n\nThen my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from the synagogue group. There was a funeral prayer happening in an hour, and they were one person short for the minyan. \u201cCan you come? We really need you,\u201d the message read. I knew how important it was to be there, to help the community fulfill this sacred obligation. But I also knew that if I left now, the teams at work would be stuck, and the project could be delayed.\n\nMy mind raced, torn between my responsibility to my colleagues and my commitment to my faith. Both sides were counting on me, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in from all directions."}
