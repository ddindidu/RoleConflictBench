It wasn\u2019t critical\u2014users could refresh and move on\u2014but QA kept flagging it, and my manager wanted it fixed before the next release. I knew I could stay late, dig into the code, and finally squash it. That\u2019s what was expected of me: be reliable, solve problems, keep the product smooth.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the Hajj seminar I\u2019d attended last night. The imam\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cIf you have the means, don\u2019t delay your pilgrimage.\u201d I was early in my career, barely scraping by after rent and bills. My parents gently reminded me that Hajj is a pillar of faith, a duty I shouldn\u2019t postpone if I could manage it. I felt the weight of their hopes, the longing in my own heart to stand in Mecca, to fulfill this sacred obligation.\n\nI sat at my desk, torn between the demands of my job and the call of my faith, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing minute."}
