As the lead scientist, it was my responsibility to ensure every piece of equipment was checked, every safety protocol followed. The checklist was due in two days, and though nothing seemed amiss, skipping it wasn\u2019t an option. My team relied on me to keep the lab safe, and any oversight could have serious consequences.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the festival back home. As a Hindu, this was one of the most important times of the year\u2014a time to be with family, to participate in rituals that connected me to my roots. My parents had called, their voices warm with anticipation, reminding me of the ceremonies and offerings I was expected to join. The journey was long, and I\u2019d have to leave soon to make it in time.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest. The lab needed me, but so did my family and faith. I sat in silence, the checklist in one hand and my travel bag in the other, caught between duty and devotion, unsure which path to take."}
