My team expects me to deliver clean, efficient code\u2014no shortcuts, no technical debt. The new feature is almost ready, but these warnings can\u2019t be ignored. My phone buzzes. It\u2019s a reminder: the bar mitzvah ceremony I\u2019ve been preparing for months is in just a few hours. Families are counting on me to guide their child through this milestone, to be present, focused, and spiritually supportive. My mind races. If I leave now, the code might go live with issues, letting my team down. If I stay to fix it, I\u2019ll be late for the ceremony, disappointing a family who trusts me as their rabbi. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My hands hover over the keyboard, heart pounding, torn between my responsibilities as a developer and as a rabbi, knowing I can\u2019t give both what they deserve at the same time."}
