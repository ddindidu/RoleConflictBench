As a taxi driver, I know I must drive defensively, especially tonight\u2014every car seems to swerve without warning, brake lights flaring in the wet darkness. My heart pounds with each close call, the city\u2019s impatience pressing in from all sides. Yet, in the back of my mind, another obligation tugs at me. The weekly Buddhist study circle meets tonight, and I haven\u2019t read the chapter we\u2019re meant to discuss. I promised myself I\u2019d be present, engaged, a true practitioner. But fares are good in this weather, and I can\u2019t afford to turn down work. The tension coils in my chest: the need to provide, to drive safely, to honor my commitments to my passengers\u2014and the longing for quiet reflection, for the peace I find in the teachings. The clock on the dashboard ticks forward, and I feel myself pulled in two directions, uncertain which path to follow."}
