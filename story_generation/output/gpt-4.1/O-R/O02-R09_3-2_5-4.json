The plant\u2019s operations were at risk\u2014unless I could address the safety concerns before the end of the day, everything would grind to a halt. My phone buzzed with messages from my manager, each one more urgent than the last. I glanced at the clock. I hadn\u2019t eaten since dawn, and my stomach twisted with hunger. I was traveling for this inspection, far from home, and the only kosher-certified vendor was a tiny stand across town, closing soon for the afternoon. \n\nAs an engineer, I was expected to be on-site, available, and responsive, especially now. But as a Jew, keeping kosher wasn\u2019t just a preference\u2014it was a commitment, a part of who I am. The team needed me here, but my faith called me elsewhere, even if just for a short while. I felt the pressure mounting, the weight of responsibility on both sides. My mind raced, torn between the demands of my profession and the obligations of my faith, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
