As a police officer, I know my duty: respond quickly, enforce the law, and restore peace. The expectation is clear\u2014public order comes first, and I\u2019m the one responsible for it tonight. But as I reach for my uniform, my heart aches. Tonight is also the annual memorial service at the temple, a sacred Buddhist ritual honoring those who have passed. My presence is expected, not just as a participant but as someone who helps lead the chanting and supports the grieving families. The community looks to me for spiritual guidance and compassion.\n\nI feel the weight of both uniforms\u2014the badge and the robe. If I leave for the party, I abandon my sangha in their moment of need. If I stay at the temple, I neglect my sworn duty to the public. My mind races, torn between the call of the siren and the call of the bell, each demanding my presence, each representing a part of who I am. I stand in the doorway, keys in hand, heart pounding, unable to move."}
