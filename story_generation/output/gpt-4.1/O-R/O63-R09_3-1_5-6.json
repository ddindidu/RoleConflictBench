My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need every sale to hit our target, or we all lose out.\u201d I could hear the buzz of my coworkers dialing, voices rising with urgency. My own numbers were just shy of the mark. I knew if I stayed, I could help push us over the line. But tonight was also the weekly synagogue service. My father had called earlier, reminding me gently, \u201cIt\u2019s important to show up, even when it\u2019s routine. Community matters.\u201d I pictured the familiar faces, the warmth of shared prayers, the sense of belonging. Yet, I also felt the weight of my team\u2019s expectations, the pressure to perform, the fear of letting everyone down. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between dialing another number and grabbing my coat for the walk to synagogue, caught in the tightening grip of two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
