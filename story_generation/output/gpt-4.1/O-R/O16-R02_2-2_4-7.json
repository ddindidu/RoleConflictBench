As her doctor, I knew she needed time\u2014time to process her new diagnosis, to ask questions, to feel heard. Her eyes searched mine, desperate for reassurance and clarity. I glanced at the clock. In twenty minutes, I was expected at the church hall, where a dozen children and their parents would be waiting for me to lead the weekly religious education class. As their priest, I was supposed to be a steady presence, guiding them in faith and answering their questions, too. My phone buzzed with a reminder. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the duty to my patient, who needed my compassion and expertise, and the responsibility to my parish, who counted on my leadership and spiritual guidance. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where I was needed most, feeling the pull of two callings that, in this moment, seemed impossible to reconcile."}
