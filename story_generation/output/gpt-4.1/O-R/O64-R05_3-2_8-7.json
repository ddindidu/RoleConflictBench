My manager\u2019s eyes flick to me, reminding me to keep things moving, but the woman in front of me is furious about a coupon that won\u2019t scan. I force a smile, apologizing, trying to soothe her, even as my phone vibrates in my pocket. I know what it is: a reminder that the bar mitzvah I\u2019ve been preparing for is about to begin. The family has been counting on me for months, and I promised I\u2019d be there to guide their son through this milestone. My heart pounds. I want to be present for them, to fulfill my duty as their rabbi, but I can\u2019t just abandon my post here, not with the holiday rush and my coworkers already stretched thin. The customer\u2019s voice rises, and I nod, trying to help, but my mind is split\u2014torn between the expectations of kindness and patience at the register, and the sacred responsibility waiting for me at the synagogue. I grip the counter, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I\u2019ll have to let down."}
