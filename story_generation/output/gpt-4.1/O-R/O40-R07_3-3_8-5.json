Mrs. Lee\u2019s voice trembled\u2014termites had eaten through her living room beams, and she feared the ceiling might collapse. As a carpenter, I knew the urgency. I promised to come by and assess the damage, already picturing the splintered wood and the careful work ahead. But as I hung up, my eyes fell on the small brass bell on my shelf\u2014a reminder that tonight, I was to lead the weekly meditation at the temple. The group counted on me to guide them in mindfulness, to be present and calm, not distracted by worldly concerns.\n\nMy mind raced. If I delayed the repair, Mrs. Lee\u2019s home could become dangerous. If I missed the meditation, I\u2019d let down the sangha and my own practice. The weight of both roles pressed on my chest\u2014one demanding swift, practical action, the other asking for stillness and presence. I stood in my workshop, torn between the call to fix what was broken and the call to sit with what is."}
