Can you fix it?\u201d The main unit\u2019s sensor errors had halted everything, and all eyes were on me\u2014the machine repairer, the one who was supposed to have answers. I knelt beside the tangled wires, tools in hand, mind racing through possible causes. The pressure was suffocating; every minute lost meant money slipping away, and my reputation was on the line.\n\nBut as I worked, my thoughts drifted to the Hajj. My parents called last night, their voices hopeful, asking if this year might finally be the year I could join them. As a Muslim, performing the pilgrimage is a sacred duty, a dream I\u2019d carried since childhood. Yet, here I was, early in my career, barely making enough to cover rent, let alone save for travel. The expectation to be the reliable repairer clashed with the longing to fulfill my religious obligation. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me\u2014was I letting down my faith, or my team? My hands trembled as I reached for another tool, caught between two worlds, unsure which demand to answer first."}
