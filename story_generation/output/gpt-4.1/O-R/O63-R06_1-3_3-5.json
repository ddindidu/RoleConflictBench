I glance at my sales numbers\u2014already ahead of target. My manager\u2019s praise echoes in my mind, but so does the reminder: \u201cKeep pushing, don\u2019t let up.\u201d The commission is tempting, and I know every extra sale counts. But as I look at the clock, I remember tonight\u2019s church service. Pastor Mark asked me to help with the youth group, and I promised I\u2019d be there. My phone rings again\u2014another potential customer. If I stay, I could close a few more deals, maybe even break my personal record. But if I miss church, I\u2019ll let down my friends and my faith community, and I\u2019ll feel the weight of that disappointment. My heart pounds as I stare at the blinking phone line, torn between the expectations of my job and the commitments of my faith."}
