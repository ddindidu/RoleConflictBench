The passenger slid into the back seat, mentioning he was just heading to a casual meeting and had plenty of time. I nodded, trying to focus on the road, but my mind kept drifting to the church hall. The children would be gathering soon, waiting for their weekly religious education class\u2014the one I was supposed to organize and lead. I could almost hear their laughter and the expectant voices of their parents, trusting me to guide their children\u2019s faith. Yet here I was, behind the wheel, responsible for getting this man safely to his destination, even if there was no rush. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cClass starts in 20 minutes.\u201d My hands tightened on the steering wheel. Should I finish the ride, honoring my duty as a driver, or should I turn back, fulfilling my promise to the parish? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
