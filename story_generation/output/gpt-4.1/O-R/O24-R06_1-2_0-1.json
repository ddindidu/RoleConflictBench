As a judge, I was expected to review every case file thoroughly, no matter how routine the hearing seemed. The file was for a procedural matter\u2014nothing controversial, just a formality, or so it appeared. But as I flipped through the pages, a detail caught my eye: the defendant was a young man from my church, someone I\u2019d seen at Sunday services, someone I knew was struggling to turn his life around.\n\nMy duty as a judge was clear\u2014impartiality, diligence, and a careful review of every fact. Yet, as a Christian, I felt a pull to show compassion, to remember the teachings of forgiveness and second chances. The expectation to uphold the law pressed against the call to live out my faith\u2019s values. My mind raced with questions: Could I truly be unbiased? Was it right to let my faith influence my legal responsibilities? The weight of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt the tension growing as I stared at the unopened file, knowing I had to choose how to proceed."}
