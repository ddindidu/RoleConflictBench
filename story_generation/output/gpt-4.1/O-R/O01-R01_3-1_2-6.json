The hospital project was behind schedule, and the contractor was pressuring me to sign off on the fire safety inspection, even though I\u2019d found a few minor issues. As an architect, I knew the regulations inside and out\u2014every unchecked box could mean lives at risk. My phone buzzed. It was a reminder: tonight\u2019s community gathering at the church. As pastor, I was expected to share a message of hope, to guide my congregation with stories of faith and trust in God\u2019s plan.\n\nBut my mind was tangled. If I delayed the project, the hospital wouldn\u2019t open on time, and the community would suffer. If I signed off too soon, I\u2019d be betraying my professional oath. At the gathering, I found myself telling the story of Daniel in the lion\u2019s den, about standing firm in the face of pressure. My words felt hollow. I could see the expectation in their eyes\u2014faith, certainty, leadership. Yet, all I felt was the weight of two worlds, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
