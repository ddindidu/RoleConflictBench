I rushed over, heart pounding, scanning the blinking red lights. The warning was clear: a potential leak, a hazard that could endanger everyone in the lab. As the lead scientist, it was my duty to act immediately, to check seals, run diagnostics, and ensure every safety protocol was followed. But as I reached for my gloves, my phone vibrated with a gentle reminder\u2014mid-Ramadan, and I was already behind on my daily Quran reading. The guilt gnawed at me; I had promised myself to recite and reflect more deeply this year, to not let work overshadow my faith. Yet here I was, torn between the urgent demands of my profession and the spiritual nourishment I craved. My colleagues depended on my expertise, but my heart ached for the peace I found in the Quran. I stood frozen, the weight of both worlds pressing down, unsure which call to answer first."}
