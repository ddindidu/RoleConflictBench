As a doctor, I knew Maria\u2019s autoimmune disease demanded careful monitoring and a strict regimen of medications. She depended on me to adjust her treatment, to catch the subtle changes that could mean the difference between stability and a dangerous flare-up. The hospital was short-staffed today, and I was the only one available to review her case and renew her prescriptions.\n\nBut as a nun, my heart ached for the family next door whose home had just burned down. The convent was organizing an emergency relief effort\u2014sorting clothes, preparing meals, offering comfort. My sisters expected me to be there, to embody compassion and service, to help those in immediate need. I could hear their voices in the hallway, calling for volunteers, their footsteps echoing my own sense of urgency.\n\nTorn between the sterile certainty of the clinic and the raw need of the world outside, I felt the expectations of both my callings pressing in on me. My hands trembled as I reached for my coat, uncertain which direction I would turn."}
