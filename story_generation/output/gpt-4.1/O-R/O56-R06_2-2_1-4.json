Her eyes darted around, searching for reassurance. I smiled, setting the broom aside, and moved to greet her. \u201cWelcome! How can I help you today?\u201d I could see her shoulders relax a little, and I knew how important it was to make her feel at ease. That\u2019s what I do\u2014create a space where people feel comfortable, cared for.\n\nBut as I led her to the chair, I glanced at the clock. Sunday morning. In less than an hour, the church service would begin. I\u2019d promised myself, and God, that I\u2019d be there every week, not just for worship but to support my church family. I thought of the choir, the prayers, the sense of belonging. Yet here I was, scissors in hand, with a client who needed me just as much in this moment.\n\nMy heart tugged in two directions. I wanted to be present for her, to do my job well, but I also felt the weight of my commitment to my faith and community. I stood behind her, cape in hand, wrestling silently with what to do next."}
