As a taxi driver, I prided myself on keeping my cab spotless\u2014my regulars expected nothing less. The city was busy, and I had a steady stream of passengers, each leaving behind a trace of their day. I checked my phone: a reminder flashed for the children\u2019s Torah class I was supposed to teach in less than an hour. As a rabbi, I knew how much the kids and their parents relied on me to guide them, to make the stories come alive and answer their questions about Jewish law. But my last fare had spilled coffee on the seat, and I couldn\u2019t leave the mess for the next passenger. My phone buzzed again\u2014one of the parents asking if I\u2019d be on time. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between my duty to provide a clean, professional ride and my responsibility to my students. My hands trembled as I scrubbed the stain, my mind racing with the impossible choice before me."}
