Today, while reviewing the plans for a new commercial building, I noticed a few minor inconsistencies\u2014nothing that would cause immediate danger, but enough to raise a red flag. My supervisor, however, brushed them off, insisting we move forward to meet the client\u2019s tight deadline. \n\nLater, I overheard a conversation between two contractors discussing a bribe paid to expedite the approval process. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I am taught to uphold dharma, to act with integrity and stand against wrongdoing. The expectation to follow my moral and ethical principles clashed sharply with the professional pressure to stay silent and keep the project on track. \n\nI sat at my desk, torn. If I reported the corruption, I risked my job and the trust of my colleagues. If I stayed quiet, I would betray my values and the very reason I became an architect. The weight of these conflicting demands pressed down on me, and I found myself paralyzed, unsure which path to take."}
