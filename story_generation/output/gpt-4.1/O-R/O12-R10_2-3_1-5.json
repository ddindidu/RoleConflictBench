My team lead had flagged several performance warnings in the new feature I\u2019d been working on for weeks. The pressure was on to deliver clean, efficient code\u2014anything less would let the team down and risk the project\u2019s success. As I pondered how to refactor the code, I overheard a heated conversation in the break room. A senior developer was boasting about manipulating some backend data to cover up a client\u2019s mistake, something that could harm users and was clearly unethical.\n\nMy heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma, to act with integrity and courage in the face of wrongdoing. But the expectation to meet my deadlines and not rock the boat as a developer weighed heavily on me. If I spoke up, I risked alienating my team and jeopardizing my project. If I stayed silent, I\u2019d betray my own values. The conflicting demands pressed in on me, and I stared at my screen, torn between my duty to my work and my duty to my conscience."}
