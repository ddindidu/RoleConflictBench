Pre-dawn shifts are usually calm\u2014tonight, the airspace is almost empty, no holding patterns, no frantic reroutes. I should feel relief, but my mind is elsewhere. Today is different. I\u2019m scheduled to chant Torah at morning services, something I\u2019ve prepared for weeks. My congregation expects me there, my family too. The rabbi even called last night to remind me how meaningful my participation would be. But the schedule changed last minute, and now I\u2019m here, headset on, responsible for the safety of every plane in my sector. I glance at the clock, calculating if I could slip away, just for an hour, maybe less. But what if traffic picks up? What if there\u2019s an emergency? My duty to the pilots and passengers is absolute. Yet, the pull of my faith, my community, tugs at me with equal force. I stare at the silent radar, heart pounding, torn between the sacred and the essential, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
