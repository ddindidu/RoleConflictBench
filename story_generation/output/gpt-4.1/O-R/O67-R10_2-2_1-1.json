As a Hindu, these daily prayers are my anchor, a promise to the divine and to myself. But as an ambulance driver, I am expected to drop everything and speed through the city, siren wailing, to help someone in pain. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds. If I delayed, even for a few minutes, I might fail someone who needed me. If I left now, my ritual would be broken, my promise to my faith unkept. The city\u2019s noise pressed in from outside, the altar\u2019s quiet glow beckoned from within. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent call of duty and the silent pull of devotion, unsure which demand I could bear to disappoint."}
