As a construction laborer, I was always alert, responsible for keeping the site safe. Suddenly, I spotted Joe, distracted, about to walk under a suspended load. My gut twisted\u2014I had to shout, to warn him, to keep everyone safe. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Sarah, desperate, her voice trembling through the speaker. She was in crisis, needing spiritual guidance, her choices weighing heavy on her soul. As her pastor, I was her anchor, expected to listen, to offer calm, thoughtful counsel. My heart pounded. The site demanded my immediate action, but Sarah needed my undivided compassion.
