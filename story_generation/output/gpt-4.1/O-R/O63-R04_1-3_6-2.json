As a telemarketer, I was supposed to take my break at a set time, but today the call volume was unusually light, and my supervisor had casually mentioned we could be flexible. I felt a rare sense of relief, thinking I could finally catch my breath. But then my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee: a large crowd had gathered for a special remembrance, and I was the only authorized imam present to lead the prayer. My heart pounded. The expectation was clear\u2014my community needed me, and the prayer couldn\u2019t be delayed. Yet, I was still technically on the clock, and leaving my desk outside the scheduled break could be seen as neglecting my job. I stared at my headset, torn between the quiet hum of the call center and the distant echo of voices waiting for me at the mosque. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my commitment. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
