The buildup was worse than I\u2019d expected, and I knew I\u2019d need extra time to wash and condition before I could even think about cutting. She glanced at her watch, and I felt the pressure to work quickly, to meet her expectations for a relaxing, efficient appointment. But as I massaged shampoo into her scalp, my mind drifted to my other life\u2014the one waiting for me at home, where I was expected to prepare a meaningful sermon for Shabbat. The calendar on my phone flashed reminders: \u201cBegin brainstorming sermon topics.\u201d The congregation counted on me for inspiration, for words that would guide them. Yet here I was, hands deep in suds, wrestling with knots both literal and figurative. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the need to be present for my client and for my community, and I wondered how I could possibly do justice to both."}
