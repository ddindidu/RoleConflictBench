The phone rang unexpectedly. The hospital pharmacy was short-staffed, and they needed me to come in urgently to fill a high-risk chemotherapy prescription. I knew how critical accuracy was; even a minor mistake could endanger a patient\u2019s life. My mind raced as I glanced at my outfit. I hadn\u2019t planned to go out, and my abaya and hijab were still drying from the wash. As a Muslim, I\u2019m expected to dress modestly in public, covering my arms, legs, and hair. But the hospital needed me now, and every minute counted for the patient waiting on that medication. I stood frozen, torn between the urgency of my professional duty and my religious commitment to modesty, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
