My shift was ending, and I was supposed to drive the vehicle from the main station to the satellite location for the next crew. The radio crackled with routine updates, but my mind was elsewhere. Today was the monthly food drive at the convent, and as a nun, I was expected to help prepare meals and greet the people who depended on us. Sister Maria had called earlier, her voice gentle but firm, reminding me that my presence was needed. I could almost hear the clatter of pots and the laughter of my sisters as they worked together. But here I was, responsible for the ambulance, expected to drive it safely and on time, ensuring it was ready for emergencies. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me\u2014one a symbol of service to the sick, the other to the poor. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my full devotion, and I felt the tension rise as I approached the intersection where my path would split."}
