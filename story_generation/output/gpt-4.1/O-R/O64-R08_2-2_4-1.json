It was Ramadan\u2019s midpoint, and I was already behind on my daily Quran reading. I kept reminding myself that tonight, after iftar, I\u2019d catch up, but the guilt pressed on me. A woman approached, holding a blender and no receipt. She pleaded, explaining it was a gift, unused, but the store\u2019s policy was clear: no returns without proof of purchase. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014no exceptions. I could see the frustration in her eyes, and I felt the weight of my uniform, the rules stitched into every seam. At the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder for maghrib and my Quran recitation. I felt torn, the demands of my job and my faith pulling me in opposite directions. My heart raced as I looked at the customer, then at the clock, knowing I was about to disappoint someone\u2014her, my manager, or myself."}
