My hands move quickly, scanning items, bagging, smiling at each customer, even as the man in front of me raises his voice about a coupon that won\u2019t scan. I remind myself to stay calm, to be patient and friendly, because that\u2019s what\u2019s expected of me as a cashier, especially now, when everyone is stressed. But my mind keeps drifting to the letter in my pocket\u2014the one from my doctor, warning that my health may not allow me to travel much longer. This year might be my only chance to perform Hajj, a pillar of my faith I\u2019ve dreamed of fulfilling. My manager expects me to work extra shifts through the holiday rush, and I know the store needs every hand. But my heart aches with the weight of my faith, the urgency of time slipping away. I force another smile for the next customer, but inside, I\u2019m torn, wrestling with the impossible choice between duty to my job and duty to my faith."}
