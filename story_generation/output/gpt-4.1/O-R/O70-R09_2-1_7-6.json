It was a customer, asking politely but urgently about the status of their delivery. As a delivery person, I\u2019m expected to respond quickly and professionally, to reassure customers and keep them satisfied. I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me that good communication is key to our reputation. But tonight was a routine service at the synagogue, and even though attendance is usually fine without me, I know how much it means to my community\u2014and to myself\u2014to be present. I felt the familiar tug between my work responsibilities and my commitment to my faith. My fingers hovered over my phone, my mind racing with the expectations from both sides. I could picture my friends already gathering, the familiar melodies starting, while at the same time, I imagined the customer waiting anxiously for an update. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood there, torn, not yet ready to choose."}
