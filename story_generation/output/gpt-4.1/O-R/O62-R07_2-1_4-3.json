As a lifeguard, I\u2019m expected to check every detail before swimmers arrive. Today, I spotted a broken lane rope, its frayed end floating like a warning. Swim lessons start soon, and if I don\u2019t fix it, the class will be chaotic, maybe even unsafe. My supervisor expects everything to be ready, no excuses.\n\nBut I\u2019d also promised myself\u2014and my sangha\u2014that I\u2019d use this quiet window for meditation. Ten minutes of mindfulness, just me and my breath, before the day\u2019s noise. As a Buddhist, I know how important it is to keep this commitment, to cultivate presence and compassion. Yet, the broken rope tugs at my attention, a physical reminder of my duty to others\u2019 safety.\n\nI stand at the edge of the pool, torn. The tools for repair are in the storage room, but so is my cushion for meditation. My heart pounds with the pressure of both roles, each demanding my full presence, each necessary in its own way. I close my eyes, feeling the weight of the choice pressing in, uncertain which expectation I should meet first."}
