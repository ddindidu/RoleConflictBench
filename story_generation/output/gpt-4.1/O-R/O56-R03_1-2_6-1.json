Her hair was soft and fragrant, clearly just washed. She smiled, \u201cI washed it right before coming, dear.\u201d The salon policy was strict: every client\u2019s hair must be washed and conditioned before a cut. My manager expected consistency, and clients expected the pampering. But Mrs. Patel\u2019s hair was spotless, and I hated the thought of wasting water and her time.\n\nAs I hesitated, my phone buzzed in my pocket. A message from Sister Agnes: \u201cThe Johnsons\u2019 house burned down. They need help now\u2014food, clothes, prayers.\u201d My heart clenched. As a nun, I was expected to drop everything for those in need, to be present, to serve. The community counted on me, especially in moments like this.\n\nI looked at Mrs. Patel\u2019s reflection, her eyes trusting, waiting for my professional care. But my mind was with the Johnsons, picturing their frightened faces, the charred remains of their home. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
