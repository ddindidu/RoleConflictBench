As the lead architect, I was expected to keep everything on schedule, and my team relied on my presence to resolve issues quickly. But today was Friday, and I was also the imam. The community had already announced my name and the topic for the Khutbah. People would be gathering soon, expecting guidance and inspiration. My mind raced, torn between the unfinished building and the waiting congregation. I could picture the workers standing idle, the client\u2019s frustration, the risk to my professional reputation. At the same time, I imagined the mosque filling with worshippers, their trust in me as their spiritual leader, their anticipation for the sermon I had promised. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, each expecting my full commitment, each unwilling to wait."}
