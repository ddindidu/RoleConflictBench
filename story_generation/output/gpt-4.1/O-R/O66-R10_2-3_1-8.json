The passenger slid into the back seat, breathless, clutching a train ticket. \u201cPlease, the station\u2014my train leaves in twenty minutes,\u201d he pleaded. I nodded, shifting into gear, but my mind was elsewhere. Today was the festival I\u2019d been waiting for all year, the one my family had traveled hours to attend. My parents expected me to be there, to join the rituals, to offer prayers and flowers at the temple. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s voice, gentle but firm: \u201cThis is our duty, our tradition.\u201d But now, behind me, the passenger\u2019s anxiety filled the car. He kept checking his watch, his need urgent and immediate. My duty as a driver was clear\u2014get him there safely and on time. But every minute I spent in traffic, every red light, felt like a thread pulling me further from the temple, from my family, from my faith. My hands tightened on the wheel as I wrestled with the impossible choice, torn between the road ahead and the path my heart longed to follow."}
