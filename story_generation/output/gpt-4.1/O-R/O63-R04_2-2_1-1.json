My script only skimmed the surface, and I could sense their impatience growing. I wanted to help, to answer honestly, but my supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cStick to the script, handle objections, don\u2019t improvise.\u201d My eyes flicked to the clock.

I pictured the expectant faces at the mosque, the trust they placed in me to guide them in worship.
