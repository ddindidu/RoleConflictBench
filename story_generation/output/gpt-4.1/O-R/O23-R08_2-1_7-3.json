The doorbell rang, and it was my firm\u2019s new assistant, unexpectedly dropping by to pick up some files. She explained she needed quick access to a client\u2019s documents for a meeting, and it would save everyone time if I just handed them over. As a lawyer, I knew the rules: client confidentiality is sacred, and only those directly involved should access sensitive files. But she was insistent, and I could sense her frustration at my hesitation.\n\nAt the same time, I felt a pang of self-consciousness. I wasn\u2019t dressed for work, and even though my attire was modest by Islamic standards, I worried about appearing unprofessional. Should I let her in, risking both my client\u2019s trust and my own comfort? Or should I stand firm, possibly offending a colleague and making things awkward at the office? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I stood frozen, torn between my professional duty and my personal values."}
