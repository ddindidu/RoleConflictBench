As an engineer, I knew the upcoming audit was still weeks away, but my supervisor had just emailed, urging me to update all our safety documentation now, not later. \u201cGet ahead of the curve,\u201d he wrote, \u201cso we\u2019re not scrambling last minute.\u201d I understood the importance\u2014lives could depend on our compliance, and I prided myself on never cutting corners.\n\nBut tonight was also the weekly religious education class at the parish. As the priest, I was expected to lead the children, answer their questions, and guide them in faith. Parents trusted me to be there, to nurture their kids\u2019 spiritual growth. I could already picture their faces, eager and expectant, waiting for me in the church hall.\n\nMy laptop pinged with another work reminder.
