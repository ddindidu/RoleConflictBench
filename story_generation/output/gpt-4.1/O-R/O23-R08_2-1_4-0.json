My client\u2019s case hinged on my performance; the motion was complex, and I knew I needed every spare moment to review arguments and anticipate the opposition. Yet, as the sun dipped below the horizon, the call to Maghrib prayer echoed softly from my phone. The evening stretched before me, unusually free from other obligations\u2014a rare chance to recite and reflect on the Quran, something my heart had been yearning for after weeks of relentless work.\n\nBut the files on my desk seemed to glare at me, a silent reminder of my duty as a lawyer. My client trusted me to be prepared, to fight for their interests with every ounce of skill I possessed. At the same time, my faith called me to slow down, to seek peace and guidance in the words of the Quran. I felt torn, pulled between the demands of my profession and the spiritual nourishment I craved. My mind raced, weighing the expectations of both roles, as I sat in the quiet, wrestling with which path to choose for the evening."}
