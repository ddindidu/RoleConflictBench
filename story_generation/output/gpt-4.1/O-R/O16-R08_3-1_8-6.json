His fever was dangerously high, and the infection was spreading fast. As a doctor, I knew I had to act quickly\u2014prescribe the strongest antibiotics, monitor his vitals, and do everything in my power to save his life. The weight of my responsibility pressed on me; my patient\u2019s family looked at me with desperate hope.\n\nBut as I reached for the medication chart, my mind wandered to my other role\u2014my faith. I was a Muslim, and the call to perform Hajj echoed in my heart. I had always dreamed of making the pilgrimage, fulfilling this sacred duty. Yet, early in my career, my salary barely covered my needs, let alone the cost of travel to Mecca. I felt torn between the immediate, life-saving demands of my profession and the deep, spiritual longing to fulfill my religious obligation. The expectations of both roles clashed within me, leaving me standing at the crossroads, my heart heavy with uncertainty."}
