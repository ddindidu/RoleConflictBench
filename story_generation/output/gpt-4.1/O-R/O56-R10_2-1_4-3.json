She stared at her reflection, her lips pressed tight, and I could sense her disappointment with the color tone. My training as a hairdresser told me to address her concerns immediately, to make sure she left happy and felt heard. But just as I was about to speak, I noticed another client quietly slipping ahead in the waiting line, bypassing someone who had been waiting patiently. \n\nAs a Hindu, I was raised to value honesty and fairness, to stand up for what\u2019s right, even in small matters. My conscience tugged at me, urging me to address the unfairness. But my client\u2019s growing discomfort demanded my attention too. I felt torn\u2014should I focus on resolving her dissatisfaction, or should I step away for a moment to address the ethical slip I\u2019d just witnessed? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood there, caught between my duty to my client and my duty to my principles, unsure which voice to answer first."}
