The hearing was in two weeks, but I knew the expectation: review every detail, no matter how routine the case seemed. My colleagues and the law demanded diligence, and I prided myself on never cutting corners. Yet, as I opened the first page, the church bell echoed through the window. Today was the main weekly service, the one where the whole community gathered, looking to me not just as a priest, but as a guide and comforter. They expected my presence, my words, my prayers. I felt the pull of both worlds\u2014justice and faith\u2014each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My hands trembled slightly as I tried to focus on the legal arguments, but my mind wandered to the congregation assembling without me. The clock ticked, and I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the silent file before me and the voices rising in prayer just beyond my reach."}
