I stood between the drivers, both agitated, each insisting the other was at fault. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, to listen carefully, gather facts, and make a just decision. But as I glanced at my watch, I realized the Sunday service at my church was about to begin. I hadn\u2019t attended in weeks, and I missed the sense of peace and community it brought me. My faith taught me to be present, to worship, and to support others, but my duty demanded I stay until the dispute was resolved. The drivers\u2019 voices grew louder, and I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the badge on my chest and the cross in my heart. I wrestled with the urge to finish quickly and slip away to church, but I knew that wouldn\u2019t be fair to those involved. Torn between my calling to serve the public and my longing to reconnect with my faith, I stood in the middle of the road, uncertain which path to follow."}
