The order was marked \u201curgent\u201d\u2014the customer had called twice, asking if I could make it before six. Dinner plans, they\u2019d said, and I could hear the worry in their voice. I knew how much people depended on these deliveries, especially on weekends. But as I checked the time again, my heart tightened. Sunday service at church was starting in twenty minutes, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d go this week. I missed the singing, the prayers, the sense of belonging. My pastor always said, \u201cHonor your commitments to God and your neighbor.\u201d But what if those commitments pulled me in opposite directions? If I rushed the delivery, I might make it to church, but risk a mistake or a late drop-off. If I stayed to ensure the customer got their groceries on time, I\u2019d miss worship\u2014again. My hands gripped the steering wheel, torn between the ticking clock and the quiet call of faith, unsure which promise I should keep."}
