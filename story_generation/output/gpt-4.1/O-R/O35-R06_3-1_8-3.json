Today, though, my hands felt clammy on the controls. The transit authority supervisor had just stepped into my cabin, clipboard in hand, his presence a silent reminder that every action would be scrutinized. I knew the expectations: flawless adherence to protocols, unwavering focus, no room for error.\n\nBut as the train sped toward the next station, my mind drifted to the church bells I\u2019d heard that morning. It was Sunday, and my congregation would be gathering soon\u2014singing, praying, sharing stories. I longed to be there, to fulfill my commitment to worship and community, to nurture my faith. Yet here I was, encased in steel and fluorescent light, my duty to the city at odds with my devotion to God.\n\nThe supervisor\u2019s gaze bore into me, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down. I wanted to honor my faith, but I couldn\u2019t abandon my post. The train slowed for the next stop, and I found myself caught between the demands of my profession and the call of my beliefs, uncertain which path to follow."}
