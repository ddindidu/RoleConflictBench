My training as a subway operator was clear: I must report the issue and bring the train to a halt immediately, ensuring the safety of every passenger. My heart pounded as I reached for the radio. But then, through the window of the operator\u2019s cabin, I caught sight of a transit supervisor on the platform, quietly slipping an envelope to a maintenance worker. I\u2019d heard rumors of corruption, but now I saw it with my own eyes. As a Hindu, I am taught to uphold dharma, to act with integrity and confront wrongdoing. The urge to expose this act, to intervene, surged within me. Yet, the safety of my passengers demanded my full attention. My hands trembled, torn between my duty to protect lives and my responsibility to stand against injustice. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding immediate action, each impossible to ignore."}
