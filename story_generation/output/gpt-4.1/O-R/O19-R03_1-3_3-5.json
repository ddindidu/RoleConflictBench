I glanced at the clock\u2014just ten minutes until I was due at the cathedral, where I\u2019d been chosen to lead tonight\u2019s prayer vigil. The sisters were counting on me; it was an honor, a duty to my faith. But here, in this moment, I was a pharmacist, expected to offer more than a rushed answer. My mind raced: I could quickly suggest acetaminophen, but what if she needed more guidance? What if she had allergies, or was on other medications? My conscience tugged at me\u2014my vow as a nun demanded presence at prayer, but my oath as a pharmacist demanded care for this patient. The weight of both roles pressed on my chest, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions. I hesitated, torn, as the woman waited for my advice and the clock ticked closer to the hour of prayer."}
