My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cEverything must be perfect\u2014no exceptions.\u201d I noticed a few pool chairs were slightly misaligned, not a safety hazard, but not up to standard either. I knew I should fix them, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the High Holiday service was tonight. As the rabbi, I was expected to deliver a sermon that would inspire and guide my entire congregation. I hadn\u2019t finished writing it yet. My mind raced with lines of scripture and half-formed ideas, but the pool demanded my attention too. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the whistle around my neck, the yarmulke in my bag. Should I take the time to realign the chairs, ensuring the facility met expectations, or rush to my office to finish the sermon that so many awaited? The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood frozen, torn between the demands of water and word."}
