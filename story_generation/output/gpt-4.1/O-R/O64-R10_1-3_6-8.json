Each customer who approached received my practiced smile and a warm greeting, just as my manager expected. \u201cGood afternoon! Did you find everything okay?\u201d I asked, even as my mind wandered to the festival my family was preparing for miles away. Today was the start of Navaratri, and my parents had called twice, reminding me of the rituals and the importance of being present. I could almost smell the incense and hear the rhythmic chanting, but here I was, folding receipts and bagging groceries. My heart tugged me toward the temple, to the prayers and the vibrant colors, but my hands kept moving, scanning and smiling. The store was quiet, but my thoughts were loud, clashing between the duty to my job and the pull of my faith. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which one I would let down."}
