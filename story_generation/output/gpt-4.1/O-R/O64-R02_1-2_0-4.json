My mind was half on the beeping scanner, half on the clock. In less than fifteen minutes, I was supposed to meet Mrs. Carter at the church office\u2014she\u2019d called me last night, her voice trembling, asking for guidance about her son\u2019s troubles. As a priest, I knew how much she needed someone to listen, to offer comfort and counsel. But as a cashier, I couldn\u2019t just abandon my post, not with my manager watching and the next shift running late. Each beep of the scanner felt heavier, the line behind the register growing just as the weight in my chest did. I could see Mrs. Carter\u2019s anxious face in my mind, waiting for me, hoping for answers. At the same time, I felt the pressure to keep the line moving, to not let my coworkers down. I glanced at the clock again, heart pounding, torn between the demands of my two worlds, unsure which duty I should honor first."}
