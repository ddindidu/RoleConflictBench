I rang the bell, and Mrs. Carter, an elderly woman from my church, opened the door. Her eyes were red, and her hands trembled as she explained her son had just been hospitalized. She\u2019d been up all night, barely functioning, and now she couldn\u2019t find her ID or even hold a pen steady enough to sign. My job demanded I secure the package and confirm delivery with a signature, but my heart ached for her. As a Christian, I felt called to show compassion, to ease her burden, to be present in her pain. The rules were clear, but so was the need for kindness. I stood there, pen in hand, torn between the expectations of my job and the teachings of my faith, wrestling with what to do next."}
