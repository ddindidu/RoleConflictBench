The office was unusually quiet, and my supervisor had just announced we could take our breaks whenever we wanted today. I glanced at the clock, thinking about how I could finally step outside, breathe, and maybe grab a coffee. But then my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a church member. There\u2019d been a sudden accident in town, and several families needed immediate support. As their pastor, I was expected to be there, to offer comfort and guidance in moments like this. My heart ached for them, but I was still on the clock, and I knew I was supposed to stay within my scheduled hours, even if the rules were relaxed today. I stared at my phone, torn between the quiet hum of the office and the urgent need of my community, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
