As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce every safety rule, no exceptions. Today, a group of teenagers laughed and dared each other to dive right beneath the bold, red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d sign. My duty was clear: intervene, stop them, keep everyone safe. But my mind was elsewhere. My family had traveled hours for an important Hindu festival, and I was supposed to be with them, fully present, joining in the rituals and offerings that only happened once a year. My phone buzzed with messages from my mother, reminding me of the sacred timing, the prayers I was missing. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014responsibility to protect these kids, and the deep pull of my faith and family. My heart pounded as I watched the teenagers inch closer to the edge, laughter echoing, while the festival bells rang in my mind. I gripped my whistle, torn between the pool and the prayers, caught in the impossible space between duty and devotion."}
