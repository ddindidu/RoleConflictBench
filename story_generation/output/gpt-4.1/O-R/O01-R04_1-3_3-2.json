The challenge was to make every inch count\u2014storage, light, movement. My mind was deep in the flow of function and form, imagining how I would move through the space, how it would serve my needs. Just as I was refining the entryway, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque committee: a large crowd had gathered for a special remembrance, and the usual imam was delayed. No one else present was authorized to lead the prayer. They needed me, now.\n\nI looked at my half-finished sketch, the ideas still swirling, the sense of urgency to capture them before they faded. But the call to lead the community in prayer was not one I could ignore lightly. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my duty to my craft, to myself, and my responsibility as an imam, to guide and support my community in their moment of need. The pressure of both roles pressed in, each demanding my presence, each too important to set aside. I stared at the unfinished lines, torn between two worlds, unsure which to answer first."}
