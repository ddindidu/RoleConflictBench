The nurse\u2019s voice still echoes in my mind: \u201cThe ventilator\u2019s failing. We need you now.\u201d My heart pounds, knowing a life depends on my skill and speed. As a machine repairer, I\u2019m expected to diagnose and fix the fault\u2014no hesitation, no mistakes. Yet, my phone vibrates with a gentle reminder: the weekly meditation group begins in ten minutes. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to be present, to cultivate calm and compassion, to sit with my sangha and nurture inner peace. The demands pull at me\u2014one from the world of wires and alarms, the other from the quiet refuge of mindfulness. I feel the tension coil in my chest, breath shallow, mind racing. Can I be both the calm observer and the urgent fixer? The ICU doors slide open, and I stand at the threshold, torn between the call to save a life and the call to save my own peace."}
