A quick check confirmed my suspicion\u2014the filtration system was malfunctioning. If I didn\u2019t fix it now, the water could become hazardous, putting swimmers at risk. My mind raced through the maintenance checklist, but then my phone buzzed with a reminder: it was almost time for the midday prayer at the mosque. As the imam, I was expected to lead, even though today the congregation would be small and another worshipper could step in. Still, I knew some members valued my presence and guidance, especially during these quieter times. I stood at the edge of the pool, tools in hand, heart pounding. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding immediate action for safety, the other calling me to spiritual leadership. I stared at the cloudy water, then at the clock, torn between the urgent needs of my community and my duty to protect those who trusted me at the pool."}
