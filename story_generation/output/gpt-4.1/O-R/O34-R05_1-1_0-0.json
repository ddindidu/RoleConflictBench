The radar screen is almost empty, just a few blips moving steadily, no holding patterns, no urgent requests. I lean back, savoring the calm, but my mind drifts to my other calling. Shabbat is weeks away, but the congregation expects a thoughtful, inspiring sermon. I should be using this lull to brainstorm, to let ideas percolate, to find a message that will resonate. Yet, every time I start jotting down notes, my eyes flick back to the screen, half-expecting a sudden burst of activity. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one demanding constant vigilance, the other quiet reflection. I know I can\u2019t give either my full attention right now. The expectation to be ever-ready for a shift in air traffic tugs at me, while the responsibility to guide my community spiritually gnaws at my conscience. I sit, pen in hand, eyes on the radar, heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role to honor in this rare moment of stillness."}
