As a lawyer, I had just finished a tense call with opposing counsel, who hinted\u2014no, demanded\u2014that I reveal information about my client. The law was clear: confidentiality was sacred. Yet the pressure was immense, and I knew that if I didn\u2019t respond soon, my client\u2019s case could be jeopardized. My phone buzzed again, this time with a reminder from the church secretary. The main weekly service was about to begin, and as the priest, I was expected to lead the prayers and offer guidance to my congregation. They relied on me for spiritual comfort, especially today, when so many were seeking hope. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the urgent legal matter and the waiting congregation. Both roles demanded my presence, my integrity, my full self. I felt the expectations of my client and my community pulling me in opposite directions, and I wondered how I could possibly honor both without failing one."}
