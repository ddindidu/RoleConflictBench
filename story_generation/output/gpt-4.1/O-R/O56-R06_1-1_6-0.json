She smiled at me in the mirror, her hair still damp and smelling faintly of her own shampoo. \u201cI just washed it before coming,\u201d she said, \u201cso you can skip the wash.\u201d The salon policy was clear: every client\u2019s hair must be washed and conditioned before a cut. It was about hygiene, consistency, and the professional standard I was expected to uphold as a hairdresser. But Mrs. Lee\u2019s hair was spotless, and I knew she was in a hurry.\n\nAs a Christian, I tried to live honestly and treat others with kindness and respect. I remembered the verse about doing everything as if for the Lord, not just for people. Skipping the wash would be bending the rules, but insisting on it felt rigid and unkind, especially when it seemed unnecessary. My manager expected me to follow protocol, but my faith nudged me toward compassion and understanding. I felt the tension coil in my chest, torn between the rules of my job and the values I tried to live by."}
