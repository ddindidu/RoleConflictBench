The court had just scheduled a procedural hearing for Friday morning\u2014a minor matter, one that could easily be postponed. But as I scanned the date, my stomach twisted. This Friday, I was set to chant Torah at synagogue, something I\u2019d promised weeks ago. My rabbi and community were counting on me; it wasn\u2019t just a reading, it was a commitment to my faith and to the people who would be there, listening, expecting.\n\nYet, as a lawyer, I knew my client relied on me to be present, to represent them, no matter how small the issue. The judge expected professionalism and punctuality. I could ask for a postponement, but would that seem like shirking my duty? Would my client feel abandoned? I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my professional oath on one side, my spiritual promise on the other. I sat at my desk, torn, the phone in my hand, unsure which call to make first."}
