As a telemarketer, I was still three sales short of my weekly target, and management\u2019s reminders echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cNumbers matter, every call counts.\u201d My fingers hovered over the phone, ready to dial again, but my heart tugged in another direction. As a nun, I had promised myself this quiet afternoon for spiritual reading and reflection, a rare oasis in my busy week. The convent was silent, sunlight streaming through stained glass, inviting me to open my prayer book and find peace. Yet, the pressure to perform, to not let my team down, gnawed at me. I could almost hear the gentle voice of my Mother Superior urging me to honor my spiritual commitments, while my supervisor\u2019s emails demanded results. My mind raced, torn between the ringing phone and the open Bible on my desk, wrestling with the weight of two worlds that seemed impossible to reconcile."}
