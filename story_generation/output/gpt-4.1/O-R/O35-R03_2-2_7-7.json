The new operational procedures were strict, and missing the session would mean risking a reprimand or worse. My phone buzzed quietly in my pocket\u2014a message from Sister Agnes. A parishioner, Maria, was waiting in the chapel, desperate to talk. She was in the midst of a crisis of faith, and as a nun, I was expected to offer guidance, to listen, to be present for her spiritual needs. My heart ached, torn between the duty to my passengers and the sacred responsibility to my community. The clock ticked closer to the briefing. I could picture Maria\u2019s anxious face, her hope that I might help her find peace. At the same time, I knew the subway couldn\u2019t run safely without operators who understood the new protocols. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, and I sat frozen, caught between the rails and the rosary, unsure which path to follow."}
