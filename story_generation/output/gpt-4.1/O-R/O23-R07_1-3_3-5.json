The hearing is minor, a procedural matter that could be postponed with a simple request. Yet, as a lawyer, I know my client expects me to be present, to show diligence even in the smallest affairs. My phone buzzes with a reminder: the weekly meditation group meets in an hour, and I am to lead. The group looks to me for guidance, for the calm presence I strive to embody as a Buddhist. I feel the tension coil in my chest\u2014my client\u2019s trust on one side, my sangha\u2019s reliance on the other. I close my eyes, searching for stillness, but my mind races with the weight of both roles. Each path tugs at me, demanding my presence, my commitment. I breathe in, feeling the conflict sharpen, knowing I must choose, but not yet ready to decide."}
