Months of preparation had led to this moment, and I knew that if I didn\u2019t gather the data now, my research\u2014and possibly my funding\u2014would be in jeopardy. As a scientist, I felt the weight of expectation: my team relied on me to lead, to seize this fleeting opportunity, to push the boundaries of knowledge. But just as I was about to begin the experiment, I received a call. A close friend from church was in crisis, desperately needing my help. The timing couldn\u2019t have been worse. My Christian values urged me to be present, to offer compassion and support, to live out my faith in action. I stood frozen, torn between the demands of my profession and the call of my conscience. The hum of the equipment seemed to grow louder, echoing the turmoil inside me. I wrestled with the knowledge that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down\u2014either my colleagues and the pursuit of science, or the values that shaped who I am."}
