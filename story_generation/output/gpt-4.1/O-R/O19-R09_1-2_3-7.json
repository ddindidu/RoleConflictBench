In less than an hour, I was supposed to be at synagogue, ready to chant my assigned Torah portion\u2014a commitment I\u2019d made weeks ago, one that my family and community expected me to honor. But just as I was about to leave, a patient approached, her face drawn with pain. \u201cWhich pain reliever should I take for my headache?\u201d she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. I knew I could give her a quick answer and rush out, but my training as a pharmacist told me I should ask more questions, make sure she wasn\u2019t masking something serious, and counsel her properly. My mind raced with the weight of both roles: the duty to my patient, who trusted me for guidance, and the responsibility to my faith and community, who were waiting for me to fulfill a sacred role. I felt torn, the expectations of both worlds pressing in, and I stood there, caught between the white coat and the tallit, unsure which path to follow."}
