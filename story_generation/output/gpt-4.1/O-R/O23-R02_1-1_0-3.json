It was a standard agreement, nothing urgent, but I knew my reputation as a lawyer rested on my diligence. I should review it thoroughly, make notes, and send back my comments well before the deadline. That\u2019s what my clients expect\u2014timeliness, precision, and unwavering attention to detail.\n\nJust as I started reading, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a parishioner, asking if we could schedule a time to talk. She didn\u2019t say it was urgent, just that she\u2019d like to chat \u201csometime soon.\u201d As a priest, I\u2019m supposed to be available, to listen, to offer comfort and guidance whenever someone reaches out. Even if it\u2019s not an emergency, I know how much courage it takes to ask for help.\n\nI stared at the contract, then at the message. Both roles demanded my presence, my care, my time. I felt the familiar tug-of-war inside me\u2014should I focus on my legal work, or reach out to the parishioner right away? The weight of both expectations pressed down, and I found myself frozen, torn between duty and compassion."}
