She glared at her reflection, her voice rising with every complaint about the cut. My hands trembled as I apologized and offered to fix it, but she wouldn\u2019t be soothed. I glanced at my phone\u2014reminder after reminder flashed: the mosque was filling up for the special remembrance, and I was the only one authorized to lead the prayer tonight. My heart pounded. The congregation expected me to be there, to guide them in worship, especially on such an important evening. Yet here I was, trapped by my duty to this client, who demanded my full attention and professionalism. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, the sacred and the secular, each insisting I could not fail them. My mind raced, torn between the angry woman before me and the faithful waiting at the mosque, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be let down."}
