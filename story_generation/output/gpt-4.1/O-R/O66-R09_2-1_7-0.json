They waved me over, asking if I could help load their bags and if they could split the fare. I nodded, already calculating the time it would take. As a taxi driver, I prided myself on being helpful and professional\u2014going the extra mile for my passengers was part of the job. But as I reached for the first suitcase, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the weekly study session with my kids was about to start. Teaching them about our Jewish traditions and history was something I cherished, a responsibility I took seriously. I knew the lesson could be shifted, but I also knew how much my children looked forward to our time together. Standing there, suitcase in hand, I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my duty to my passengers and my commitment to my family. I hesitated, torn between the expectations of my job and the values I wanted to pass on to my children."}
