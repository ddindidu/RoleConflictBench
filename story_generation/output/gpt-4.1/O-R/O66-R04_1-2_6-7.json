As a taxi driver, I prided myself on keeping my car immaculate\u2014my passengers expected a clean, comfortable ride, and I never wanted to disappoint. Just as I finished, my phone buzzed. It was Brother Ahmed, a long-time member of my congregation. His message was urgent: he needed to meet with me today, his family was in crisis, and he didn\u2019t know where else to turn. As an imam, I knew how much he relied on my guidance, especially in moments like this. But my next fare was already waiting, and I couldn\u2019t afford to cancel\u2014my family depended on every ride I gave. I stared at my phone, torn. My duty as an imam was to be there for my community, to offer comfort and counsel. But as a taxi driver, I had a responsibility to my passengers and my own family\u2019s livelihood. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I sat in the driver\u2019s seat, heart pounding, unsure which path to take."}
