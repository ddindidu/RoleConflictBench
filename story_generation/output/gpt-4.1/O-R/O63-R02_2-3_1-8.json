My script only skimmed the surface, and I could hear the impatience in their voice. My manager expected me to handle objections smoothly, to keep the call going, to close the deal. But my phone buzzed with a message from the parish office: the Martinez family needed me to organize a last-minute, crucial preparation session for their child\u2019s sacrament\u2014tonight. I was the only priest available, and this was a milestone for their family. My mind raced, torn between the pressure to meet my sales quota and the responsibility to guide a child through a sacred rite. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be present, knowledgeable, and compassionate. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on the customer\u2019s questions, but my thoughts kept drifting to the church, to the family waiting for my guidance. I knew I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and the clock was ticking."}
