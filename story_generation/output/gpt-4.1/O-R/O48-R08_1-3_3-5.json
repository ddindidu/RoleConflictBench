It was almost time for Friday prayers, and I hurried to the staff room to change into my abaya and hijab. Just as I was about to leave for the prayer hall, my supervisor called out, \u201cWe need you to take Mr. Lee\u2019s vitals\u2014he\u2019s not looking well.\u201d I hesitated, feeling the weight of my stethoscope in one hand and my prayer beads in the other. As a nursing assistant, I knew how important it was to check on Mr. Lee immediately, to record his temperature and pulse without delay. But as a Muslim, I felt the pull of the congregational prayer, the expectation to dress modestly and join the community in worship on time. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the urgent needs of my patient and the spiritual obligation that called me."}
