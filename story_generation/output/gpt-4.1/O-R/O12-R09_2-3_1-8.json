I know what\u2019s expected of me: clean, maintainable, efficient code. I pride myself on it. But the clock is ticking, and the feature is almost ready for release. If I don\u2019t fix these warnings now, the whole team could be delayed.\n\nMy phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from the synagogue group: \u201cWe need one more for the minyan. Funeral prayer in 30 minutes. Can you come?\u201d I know what this means. Without a tenth person, the prayer can\u2019t happen, and the grieving family will be left without the comfort of tradition. As a Jew, I\u2019m expected to show up, to be there for my community, especially in moments like this.\n\nI feel the pressure mounting from both sides. My team is counting on me to deliver quality work, but my community is counting on me to help them fulfill a sacred obligation. My hands hover over the keyboard, my mind racing, torn between the demands of my profession and my faith."}
