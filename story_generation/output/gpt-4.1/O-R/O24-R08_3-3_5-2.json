The bail hearing ran late, and now the defendant waits in a holding cell, his fate hanging on my written order. The law is clear: I must draft a detailed opinion, outlining the conditions of his release, and sign it tonight. The expectation is unyielding\u2014justice delayed is justice denied. Yet, tonight is also the community Quran study circle, a gathering I have not missed in months. We are to discuss verses I have not yet read, verses I promised myself I would reflect on before joining the group. My heart aches with the weight of both roles. The law demands my clarity and diligence; my faith calls for my presence and contemplation. I stare at the blank order on my desk, the Quran resting unopened in my bag, and feel the tension coil inside me, torn between the demands of justice and the nourishment of my soul."}
