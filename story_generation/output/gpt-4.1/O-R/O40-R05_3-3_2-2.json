The beams for the new community center needed to be cut and fitted today, but before I could even think of starting, I had to inspect every saw, every drill, every blade. Safety was non-negotiable; one careless moment could mean disaster for me or my crew. Yet, as I checked the teeth of my circular saw, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the High Holiday sermon. The congregation would gather tonight, expecting words of wisdom and comfort. I hadn\u2019t written a single line. My mind spun with the weight of both worlds\u2014my duty to keep my team safe, and my responsibility to guide my community spiritually. Each role demanded my full attention, but time was slipping away. I stared at the tools, then at my notes, feeling the pressure build inside me, torn between the calluses on my hands and the words in my heart."}
