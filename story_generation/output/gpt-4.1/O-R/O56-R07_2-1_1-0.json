A woman stood hesitantly at the entrance, her eyes darting from the chairs to the mirrors, clutching her purse tightly. I knew that look\u2014nervous, uncertain, hoping for reassurance. As a hairdresser, it was my job to greet her warmly, to make her feel at ease, to offer her a seat and a cup of tea, to listen to her wishes and worries about her hair. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. The evening chant at the temple would begin soon, and as a practicing Buddhist, I was expected to be there, joining my community in ritual and reflection. The temple was only a few blocks away, but the timing was impossible. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014the client\u2019s hopeful eyes, the imagined sound of the temple bell. My hands trembled slightly as I tried to decide which expectation to honor, feeling torn between the comfort I could offer here and the peace I sought there."}
