My manager\u2019s reminders echo in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d I stare at my call list, dialing number after number, my voice growing hoarse, my nerves fraying. Every rejection stings sharper tonight. But as the sun dips below the horizon, my phone vibrates with a message from the mosque: \u201cStudy circle at 8. We\u2019ll discuss Surah Al-Baqarah, verses 30-50.\u201d My heart sinks. I haven\u2019t read those verses yet, let alone reflected on them.
