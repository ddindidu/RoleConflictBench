My passenger, a nervous businessman, kept glancing at his watch, reminding me that his international flight was leaving in less than an hour. Every red light, every cautious turn, felt like a personal failure. He expected me to get him there safely and on time, but the roads were slick, and accidents dotted the route. My phone buzzed on the dashboard\u2014a message from the parish secretary. The Martinez family was waiting at the church, their daughter\u2019s sacrament only days away. They needed me, their priest, to lead a final, crucial preparation session. I could picture the little girl\u2019s anxious face, the family\u2019s hope resting on my presence. My hands tightened on the wheel. I was being pulled in two directions: the duty to my passenger, desperate to make his flight, and the responsibility to my parishioners, counting on me for a milestone in their faith. The storm outside was nothing compared to the turmoil inside me as I weighed which role I would have to let down."}
