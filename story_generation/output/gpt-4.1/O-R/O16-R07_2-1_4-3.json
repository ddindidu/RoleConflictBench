My patient, Mrs. Lee, sits across from me, her eyes wide with worry as she clutches the pamphlet about her new diagnosis. She asks question after question, her voice trembling, desperate for reassurance and clarity. As her doctor, I know I must be present, patient, and clear\u2014she deserves my full attention and empathy. Yet, in the back of my mind, I am acutely aware that my ten-minute window for mindfulness and meditation is about to begin, a practice I promised myself I would not neglect today. The expectation to be a compassionate guide for Mrs. Lee clashes with my commitment to cultivate inner peace and clarity as a Buddhist. My heart aches with the tension: to stay and support her, or to step away and honor my own need for stillness. I feel the conflict rising, my breath shallow, as I wrestle with the demands of both roles, uncertain which path to choose."}
