The charge nurse had made it clear: \u201cHe\u2019s critical. Don\u2019t leave his side. We need updates every few minutes.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders. My phone buzzed in my pocket. A message from Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation: \u201cPastor, could you call? I\u2019m having a hard day.\u201d I remembered her husband\u2019s recent passing, the way she clung to my words last Sunday. She needed comfort, a gentle voice, a prayer. But Mr. Lee\u2019s monitor beeped again, demanding my attention. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014one by the urgent needs of my patient, the other by the quiet suffering of someone who trusted me for spiritual support. I stared at my phone, then at Mr. Lee, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, unsure which call to answer first."}
