I nodded, reaching for my scissors, but my stomach rumbled\u2014reminding me I hadn\u2019t eaten since morning. I glanced at the clock. My next client was due soon, and I\u2019d only have a short break. \n\nNormally, I\u2019d grab a quick bite from the caf\u00e9 next door, but today, I was in an unfamiliar part of town. The only kosher-certified vendor I\u2019d found was a good ten-minute walk away, and I\u2019d barely have time to get there and back before my next appointment. If I took extra time perfecting Mrs. Klein\u2019s fringe, I\u2019d have to skip lunch or break my kosher observance. If I rushed, I might disappoint her, something I always tried to avoid as a hairdresser. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my commitment to my clients, and my commitment to my faith\u2014each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
