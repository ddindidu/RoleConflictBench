It was a new client, her voice tentative, asking if I could walk her through the basics of the machine I\u2019d just serviced. I glanced at the clock\u2014barely an hour before I was due at the monastery to help with the dawn preparations. The festival was important, a time when the whole community came together, and I\u2019d promised the abbot I\u2019d be there early to help set up the altar. Yet, the client sounded anxious, and I knew how overwhelming new equipment could be. My job wasn\u2019t just fixing machines; it was making sure people felt confident using them. But the thought of missing the opening chants, of letting down my fellow practitioners, gnawed at me. I could hear the gentle clatter of bowls being arranged in the hall, the soft hum of anticipation. My phone felt heavy in my hand as I weighed the needs of the client against the silent call of the monastery, torn between the world of wires and the world of stillness."}
