Dispatch had said the patient\u2019s injury wasn\u2019t life-threatening, but protocol demanded urgency. My mind was on the road, but my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Larkin, a parishioner. She wanted to talk\u2014nothing urgent, she said, just a need for guidance. As a priest, I knew how much courage it took for someone to reach out, even casually. I felt the weight of her expectation, the silent hope that I\u2019d be available, attentive, and compassionate. But as an ambulance driver, I was responsible for the safety of my partner, the patient, and everyone on the road. I couldn\u2019t risk a reckless maneuver, nor could I ignore the call for spiritual support. The city\u2019s chaos pressed in, and I felt torn, my hands tight on the wheel, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which duty should come first."}
