He was upset about a charge on his latest invoice, claiming it was a mistake. As an accountant, I knew my job was to communicate clearly and professionally, to stand by our records, and to ensure the company\u2019s interests were protected. But as I read his frustrated words, I remembered my faith\u2014how I\u2019m called to show love and kindness, even in business. I wanted to respond with patience and understanding, to offer a small gesture of goodwill, maybe even waive the fee as a sign of grace. But I also felt the weight of my responsibility to the company, to be firm and fair, not to set a precedent that could be taken advantage of. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my heart torn between the expectations of my profession and the teachings I try to live by."}
