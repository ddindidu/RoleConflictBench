As her doctor, I knew she needed clear, honest answers, and I owed her my full attention and empathy. I could see her anxiety, and I wanted to reassure her, to explain everything in a way that would ease her mind. But as I listened, my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the parish office. The Martinez family was waiting for me to lead their child\u2019s final sacrament preparation session, a session I had promised to organize and could not be postponed. As their priest, I was expected to guide them spiritually, to be present and attentive, especially now, on the eve of such an important milestone. My mind raced, torn between the patient in front of me who needed my medical care and the family at church who needed my spiritual guidance.
