On one side, a thick stack of merger documents demands my attention\u2014pages of dense legalese, each clause a potential trap for my client. The deadline is tight; if I don\u2019t catch every risk tonight, my client could face financial disaster. My phone buzzes with reminders from the office, the pressure mounting with every passing minute.\n\nBut on the other side, my Buddhist teacher\u2019s gentle message echoes in my mind. Tomorrow, I\u2019m to present a summary of the Heart Sutra at the temple. I promised to reflect deeply, to offer insights that might help others on their path. The expectation is not just to recite, but to embody calm and clarity, to be present and sincere.\n\nI feel torn, my mind pulled in two directions. The lawyer in me is restless, anxious, scanning for loopholes and liabilities. The Buddhist in me yearns for stillness, for the quiet wisdom that comes only with undistracted contemplation. I close my eyes, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, uncertain which to serve first as midnight approaches."}
