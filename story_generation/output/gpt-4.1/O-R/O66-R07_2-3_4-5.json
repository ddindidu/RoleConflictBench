As a taxi driver, I was expected to drive defensively, eyes darting between mirrors and the unpredictable dance of cars weaving through lanes. Every sudden brake light sent a jolt through me, my hands tightening on the wheel. I glanced at the clock\u2014my weekly meditation group would begin in less than an hour, and as the leader, I was expected to guide everyone in calm, mindful presence. The thought of arriving late, or worse, not at all, gnawed at me. My mind tugged in two directions: the duty to my passengers\u2019 safety and the commitment to my sangha. I tried to focus on my breath, but the blare of a horn snapped me back. The city demanded vigilance, not tranquility. My heart pounded, torn between the chaos of the road and the peace I was supposed to embody. The rain kept falling, and I was caught in the tension, uncertain which role to honor as the minutes slipped away."}
