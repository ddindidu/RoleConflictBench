I glance at the clock\u2014just an hour until Shabbat service, and my sermon notes are still scattered in my bag, half-finished. As a hairdresser, I know I should greet her, offer tea, and make her feel at home, especially since the receptionist is idly scrolling through her phone. But as a rabbi, my mind is racing with the unfinished message I need to deliver tonight, words that my congregation expects to inspire and guide them. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me: the expectation to be present and welcoming here, and the responsibility to be spiritually prepared there. My heart pounds as I stand at the crossroads, torn between the comfort of a familiar client and the sacred duty awaiting me."}
