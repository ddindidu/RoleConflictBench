As a doctor, I was expected to deliver the news with clarity and compassion\u2014Mr. Sharma\u2019s diagnosis was grave, and his family waited anxiously inside. I rehearsed the words, knowing how much they would hurt, but also knowing honesty was my duty. Just as I steadied myself, I noticed a colleague quietly slipping ahead of another nurse in the medication queue, a small act but against the fairness I valued deeply as a Hindu. My upbringing taught me to uphold dharma, to act with integrity even in small matters. Yet, the family\u2019s pain pressed on me, demanding my full attention and empathy. Should I address the minor injustice now, risking delay and distraction, or focus solely on the family\u2019s needs? The weight of both roles pressed on my chest, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I felt the tension knotting in my stomach as I reached for the door."}
