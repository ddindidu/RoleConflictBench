My mind raced, absorbing every detail\u2014this knowledge was crucial for my patients\u2019 safety. Yet, as the clock ticked closer to Maghrib, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee: a large crowd had gathered for a special remembrance, and I was the only authorized imam present. My heart pounded. The community expected me to lead the prayer, to offer guidance and comfort. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss the most critical part of the workshop, risking my professional responsibility to stay updated and provide the best care. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest.
