It was a routine matter, one that could easily be postponed if I needed to. As I waited, I overheard two lawyers in the hallway discussing a bribe they had arranged with a court official. Their words were casual, but the implications were serious\u2014someone\u2019s fate was being bought and sold. My heart pounded. As a lawyer, my duty was to my client, to be present and represent them, no matter how small the case. But as a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma, to act with integrity and confront wrongdoing. The expectation to speak out, to take moral action, pressed heavily on me. Yet, if I left to report what I\u2019d heard, I would abandon my client and fail in my professional duty. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I could not give to the other. My mind raced, caught between the courtroom and my conscience, unsure which path to follow."}
