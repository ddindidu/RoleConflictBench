The message was urgent: the synagogue needed one more person for the minyan at a funeral prayer. My supervisor had just reminded me that the manager would be inspecting the rooms today, and I could see the dust gathering in the corners, the fingerprints on the glass. I knew what was expected of me here\u2014every surface spotless, every room perfect. But the message tugged at me. As a Jew, I knew how important it was to help form the minyan, especially for a funeral prayer. Without me, the prayer couldn\u2019t happen, and the grieving family would be left waiting. My mop dripped onto the floor as I stood frozen, torn between the demands of my job and the call of my faith. The clock ticked, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting me to be present, each unwilling to wait."}
