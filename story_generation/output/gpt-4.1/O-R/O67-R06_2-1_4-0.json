I raced the ambulance through the city streets, my mind already running through the steps\u2014splint, pain relief, calm reassurance. When I arrived, she was pale and trembling, her arm at an odd angle. I knelt beside her, gloves snapping on, and reached for the pain medication. But then I saw the small cross around her neck, and she whispered, \u201cPlease, no drugs. I want to offer my pain to God.\u201d\n\nAs an ambulance driver, I\u2019m expected to ease suffering, to follow protocol and provide care. But as a Christian, I\u2019m taught to respect another\u2019s faith, to honor their wishes, even if I don\u2019t understand them. My training screamed at me to help her, to do what I knew was right medically. But my heart ached with the weight of her faith, her trust in something greater. I could feel the tension twisting inside me, torn between my duty to heal and my calling to respect her beliefs. I hesitated, caught in the space between two worlds, unsure which voice to follow."}
