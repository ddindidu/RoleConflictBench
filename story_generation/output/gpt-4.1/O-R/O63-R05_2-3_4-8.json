My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to close strong this week.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, when my phone buzzed with a message from the synagogue president. \u201cRabbi, Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s husband just passed. The family needs you for the funeral as soon as possible.\u201d My heart clenched. I knew how much the Goldsteins relied on me for comfort and guidance, especially in moments like this. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss my target, risking my job and disappointing my team.

The expectations of my two worlds pressed in, each demanding my presence, each impossible to ignore."}
