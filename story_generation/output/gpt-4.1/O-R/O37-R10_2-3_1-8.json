Lately, I\u2019ve noticed dust gathering in the corners and smudges on the windows, so I\u2019ve been cleaning more often, making sure every surface shines. But as a Hindu, I\u2019m also expected to travel to my family\u2019s village for a major festival. The rituals and ceremonies are important, and my parents are counting on me to be there, to help with the offerings and prayers. The festival lasts several days, and I know I\u2019ll have to be away from work. My supervisor has already mentioned how crucial it is to keep up with the cleaning schedule, especially now. I feel torn\u2014if I leave, the house might not meet the standards expected of me, but if I stay, I\u2019ll miss the festival and disappoint my family. The pressure from both sides is overwhelming, and I find myself caught between my duty to my job and my devotion to my faith, unsure of what to do next."}
