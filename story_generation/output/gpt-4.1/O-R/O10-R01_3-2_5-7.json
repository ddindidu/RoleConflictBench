As an accountant, I knew the urgency\u2014any delay in responding could mean penalties for my client, and my reputation was on the line. The numbers on the page swam before my eyes, demanding my full attention, my expertise, my precision. Yet, on the other side of my desk, my open Bible and scattered sermon notes called to me. Sunday was only two days away, and my congregation expected guidance, clarity, and inspiration. They looked to me, their pastor, to help them navigate moral choices, to offer hope and direction. I could almost hear their voices, see their expectant faces. The weight of both roles pressed down on me\u2014one demanding immediate action, the other requiring deep reflection. My mind raced, torn between the urgent call of compliance and the sacred duty to teach. I closed my eyes, feeling the tension coil in my chest, knowing I could not give both the attention they deserved at the same time."}
