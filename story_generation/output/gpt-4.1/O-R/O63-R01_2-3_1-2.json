The phone rang, and another prospect launched into a barrage of technical questions. My job as a telemarketer was clear: handle objections, keep the call on track, and never stray from the script. But the script only skimmed the surface, and I could hear the frustration in their voice as I fumbled for answers I didn\u2019t have. My supervisor expected efficiency and results, not improvisation.\n\nAs soon as my shift ended, I hurried to the church office. A member of my congregation waited, eyes red from crying. They poured out their heart, desperate for spiritual guidance as they faced a decision that could change their life. Here, I was expected to listen deeply, offer wisdom, and help them find peace. But my mind kept drifting back to the calls, the pressure to perform, the feeling of not being enough in either place. I felt torn\u2014how could I be present and compassionate here, when the demands of my other role still echoed in my mind? The weight of both expectations pressed down, and I sat in silence, unsure which part of me to answer."}
