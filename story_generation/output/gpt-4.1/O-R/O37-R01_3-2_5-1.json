My checklist was clear: maintain supplies, never let essentials run out. I felt a knot in my stomach\u2014this was the third time this month something had slipped through. As I stood in the pantry, mentally running through options, my phone buzzed. It was Sarah from church, her voice trembling. She needed to talk, urgently\u2014she was facing a decision that could change her life, and she wanted my guidance as her pastor. I glanced at the empty shelf, then at the clock. The Johnsons expected their home spotless and their heirlooms cared for. Sarah expected compassion, wisdom, and my undivided attention. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My heart pounded as I tried to figure out how to be both the reliable cleaner and the present pastor, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy both at once."}
