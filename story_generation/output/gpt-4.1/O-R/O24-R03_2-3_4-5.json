As a judge, I am expected to write a clear, thorough judgment\u2014every fact weighed, every conclusion justified. The parties await my words, their futures hanging in the balance. Yet, as a nun, my life is also bound by the rhythm of prayer and service. This week, I have been chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the city\u2019s cathedral, a rare honor for our convent. The sisters expect me to guide them, to be present in spirit and body, to inspire faith in the crowd. My mind is pulled in two directions: the solemn duty to the law, and the sacred call to prayer. Each role demands my full presence, my undivided attention. I feel the weight of expectation pressing from both sides, my heart torn between the silence of the courtroom and the hymns of the chapel. I close my eyes, searching for guidance, knowing that soon I must choose where to give my time, and which part of myself to set aside."}
