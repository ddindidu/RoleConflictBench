A fellow church member, Mark, approached, his tone light and friendly. \u201cSo, I heard you\u2019re working on that big case. What\u2019s it about?\u201d he asked, curiosity shining in his eyes. As a lawyer, I knew I couldn\u2019t reveal anything about my client\u2019s case\u2014confidentiality was sacred, and my professional ethics demanded absolute discretion. But Mark was also my brother in Christ, someone I saw every Sunday at church, someone who expected openness and trust within our close-knit community.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My church expected me to be present, honest, and engaged, to share in the joys and struggles of our lives together. Yet, my duty as a lawyer required silence, even if it meant appearing distant or secretive. My heart pounded as I searched for words, torn between the trust of my client and the expectations of my faith community. The conversation hung in the air, and I could feel the tension tightening inside me, unsure which part of myself I could honor without betraying the other."}
