I rushed over, heart pounding, as the warning lights flashed an angry red. The manual was clear: any sign of a leak, no matter how minor, required immediate attention. I checked the clock\u2014ten minutes until the Sunday service began. I\u2019d promised my pastor I\u2019d be there, and I knew my absence would be noticed. My faith community counted on me, not just for worship but for the sense of togetherness we built each week. Yet, as a scientist, I was responsible for the safety of everyone in the lab. If I left now, I\u2019d be ignoring every protocol I\u2019d ever enforced, risking not just equipment but lives. My phone buzzed with a reminder for church, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. I stood frozen, torn between the call to worship and the duty to protect, my mind racing with the expectations of both my faith and my profession."}
