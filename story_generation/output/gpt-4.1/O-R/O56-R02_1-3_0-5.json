Mrs. Lee, a regular, walked in, her face lighting up as she spotted me. I was supposed to greet her warmly, offer her tea, and make her feel at home\u2014she always said my chair was her safe space. The receptionist was free, but Mrs. Lee preferred me. I started toward her, rehearsing my usual cheerful welcome, when my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from the church: a young man had arrived, desperate and in tears, asking for me by name. He needed spiritual guidance, right now. My heart pounded. I could see Mrs. Lee\u2019s expectant smile, and I could almost hear the young man\u2019s sobs echoing through the empty sanctuary. Both needed me, but in such different ways. I stood frozen, torn between the comfort of scissors and the weight of the collar, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me apart."}
