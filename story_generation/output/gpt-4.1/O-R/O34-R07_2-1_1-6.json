My headset crackles with pilots\u2019 voices, all seeking updates, clearances, a way out of the holding patterns stacking up over the city. I scan the approach fixes, calculating, adjusting, trying to keep the delays moderate, the airspace safe. My heart pounds with the pressure\u2014every second counts, every instruction matters.\n\nMy phone vibrates on the desk. It\u2019s Tenzin, my friend from the sangha. He wants to talk about the sermon we heard last night, about letting go of attachment and finding stillness in chaos. He asks if I have a moment to reflect, to share insights, to practice what we preach. I feel the tug\u2014my commitment to spiritual study, the expectation to be present, to listen deeply, to nurture wisdom.\n\nBut the radio is alive with urgency, and the screens demand my full attention. I feel split, torn between the world\u2019s noise and the promise of quiet understanding. My breath catches as I weigh the needs of the sky against the needs of the spirit, caught in the space between duty and devotion."}
