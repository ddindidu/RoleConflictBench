He sounded frustrated, and I knew I needed to explain the charges clearly and professionally. My mind raced through spreadsheets and receipts, searching for the right words to reassure him. Just as I was about to respond, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the community gathering was starting in ten minutes, and I was expected to share a short teaching on honesty and integrity.\n\nI felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As an accountant, I had to be precise and transparent, answering every question with patience. As a pastor, I was supposed to inspire trust and guide others in living out their faith. But now, the two roles collided\u2014if I stayed on the call, I\u2019d be late to the gathering and let down my congregation. If I left the call, I\u2019d risk damaging a client relationship and my professional reputation. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, torn between the demands of my two worlds."}
