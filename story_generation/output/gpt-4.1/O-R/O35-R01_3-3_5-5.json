Suddenly, the emergency alarm blared\u2014a passenger needed urgent medical help. My training as a subway operator kicked in: I had to stop at the next station, alert emergency services, and ensure everyone\u2019s safety. But as I reached for the radio, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from my church deacon: a fire had swept through a member\u2019s home, and the congregation was gathering for support. As their pastor, I was expected to be there, to comfort, to lead prayers, to help them through the crisis. My heart pounded. I could see the fear in the passengers\u2019 eyes, hear the panic in the deacon\u2019s voice. Both needed me\u2014right now. I gripped the controls, torn between the duty to those on my train and the responsibility to my grieving community, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
