His blood pressure had been dropping, and I was supposed to check his vitals every five minutes. The beeping of monitors and the urgency in the air kept me alert, focused on my duty as a nursing assistant. But as I passed the supply closet, I caught sight of a senior nurse slipping a vial of medication into her bag\u2014medication meant for our patients. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act with honesty and protect others from harm. Reporting her would be the right thing, but it would mean leaving Mr. Sharma unattended, even for a few minutes, risking his fragile condition. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the expectation to care for my patient without fail, and the moral imperative to confront wrongdoing. I stood frozen in the hallway, torn between my duty to my patient and my duty to my conscience, feeling the conflict tighten around me with every passing second."}
