It wasn\u2019t critical\u2014users could refresh and move on\u2014but QA kept flagging it, and my manager wanted it fixed before the next release. I knew it would take a few late nights to track down the root cause, and the pressure was mounting. At the same time, my friends were finalizing their plans for Hajj. We\u2019d been saving for years, and this season, everything had finally lined up: the funds, the time, the group. My heart ached at the thought of missing this once-in-a-lifetime journey, but I also felt the weight of responsibility at work. My team was counting on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I found myself torn, caught between my duty to my faith and my commitment to my job, unsure which path to choose."}
