As a judge, I knew the expectation: every case, no matter how routine, deserved my full attention. The hearing was in two weeks, but the file had just arrived, and I prided myself on being thorough and prepared. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I felt a familiar tug. It was nearly time for the Wednesday evening church service\u2014a commitment I rarely missed. My faith was not just a private comfort; it was a community, a source of strength, and a responsibility. I could already imagine the warmth of the sanctuary, the familiar hymns, the quiet moments of prayer. But the file on my desk was a silent reminder of my duty to the law and to those who depended on my diligence. My mind raced, torn between the call to serve my community in worship and my obligation to serve justice with care. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to yield."}
