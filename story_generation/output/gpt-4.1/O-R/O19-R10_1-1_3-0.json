A woman approached, her face pinched with discomfort, and asked which medicine would be best for her headache. I knew I should take a few minutes to counsel her properly, explain the options, side effects, and safe usage. But my mind was elsewhere\u2014today, I hadn\u2019t performed my full morning puja. I\u2019d only managed to whisper a short mantra under my breath between customers, skipping the incense, the offerings, the meditative silence my faith asks of me. Guilt tugged at me from both sides: the expectation to be a thorough, caring pharmacist, and the longing to honor my Hindu rituals completely. As I gave the woman a brief answer, I felt the weight of my divided self\u2014one part wanting to serve my patient fully, the other aching for the spiritual grounding I\u2019d neglected. The conflict pressed in on me, and I hesitated, caught between the demands of my profession and the call of my faith."}
