As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to take my breaks exactly as scheduled\u2014no more, no less. Today, just as my break begins, my phone buzzes with a message from Ahmed, a community member. \u201cImam, do you have a moment? I could really use your advice.\u201d He\u2019s been struggling lately, and I know how much it means for him to reach out. But my break is only fifteen minutes, and if I go over, I\u2019ll get another warning. The call center expects me to be efficient, to return on time, to keep the queue moving. But as an imam, I\u2019m supposed to be available, to listen, to offer comfort when someone needs it most. I stare at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, torn between the rigid schedule of my job and the open-hearted presence my community expects. My hands tremble as I try to decide which role I can afford to disappoint today."}
