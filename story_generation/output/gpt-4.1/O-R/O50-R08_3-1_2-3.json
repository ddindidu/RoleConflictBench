The call came suddenly\u2014an urgent request from the hospital. A life-support device in the ICU was flashing critical fault codes, and I was the only technician nearby. My mind raced as I grabbed my tool kit, but then I hesitated. The hospital\u2019s sterile environment required me to change into their standard-issue scrubs, which were short-sleeved and didn\u2019t meet my usual standards for modesty. As a Muslim, I always made sure to dress according to my beliefs, even at work. But now, a patient\u2019s life depended on how quickly I could get there and start repairs. The hospital expected me to comply with their dress code for hygiene and safety, but my faith expected me to maintain my modesty. I stood in the hallway, torn between the urgent beeping of the machine and the quiet, persistent voice of my conscience, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
