The critical service was lagging, and the traces pointed directly to the functions I\u2019d merged this morning. My team was counting on me to fix it\u2014quickly and cleanly. I knew I\u2019d have to comb through every line, refactor, and test, maybe for hours. But my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder: evening prayers. As a devout Hindu, I never missed my daily rituals\u2014lighting the lamp, chanting, offering flowers. It was my anchor, my peace. But now, the expectation to uphold my faith clashed with the urgent demand to be a responsible developer. My mind raced, torn between the code that needed me and the altar waiting in the next room. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait."}
