As a telemarketer, I was used to handling customer objections, answering questions with practiced patience. Most callers were polite, and the script covered almost everything they asked. But today, my mind was elsewhere. My family and I were traveling across the state for a major Hindu festival. It was my duty to be present, to join in the rituals, to offer prayers and flowers, to chant with everyone else. My mother\u2019s eyes met mine, silently reminding me of the importance of our traditions.\n\nBut my shift wasn\u2019t over. My supervisor expected me to stay on the line, to keep my numbers up. I could hear the temple bells in the distance, the chanting growing louder as we neared the festival grounds. My phone buzzed with another call. I hesitated, torn between the expectation to answer and the pull of my faith. The bus stopped, and my family began to gather their things, ready to step into the sacred space. My heart pounded as I stared at the blinking light on my headset, caught between two worlds, unsure which one to answer."}
