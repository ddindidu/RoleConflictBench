As a lifeguard, I\u2019m expected to keep my eyes glued to the water, scanning for any sign of trouble. Even when the pool is calm, I can\u2019t let my guard down\u2014just now, I noticed a couple of kids drifting toward the deep end, and though they\u2019re not in danger yet, I know how quickly things can change. But as a Christian, Sunday is sacred. My church expects me to be there, worshipping, singing, and joining in the community. I can almost hear the choir starting, the pastor\u2019s voice echoing through the sanctuary. My phone buzzes with a reminder from the church group chat, asking if I\u2019ll help with the food drive after service. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the responsibility to protect lives here, and the call to nurture my faith and community there. My heart aches as I sit in my lifeguard chair, torn between the whistle around my neck and the cross I wear beneath my shirt, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
