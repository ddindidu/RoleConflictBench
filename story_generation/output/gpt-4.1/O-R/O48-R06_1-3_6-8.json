She reached out, her frail hand trembling, and asked if I could stay a little longer. As a nursing assistant, I knew my job was to provide emotional support and companionship, especially to patients like her who had no visitors. But I also had a strict schedule, and other patients were waiting for their care.\n\nInside, my heart ached. My faith as a Christian told me to show love and kindness, to be present for those in need, just as Jesus would. I wanted to sit with her, hold her hand, and listen to her stories. Yet, the demands of my job pulled me in another direction\u2014reminding me of the importance of fairness and responsibility to all my patients.\n\nI stood by her bedside, torn between the expectations of my profession and the teachings of my faith. The clock ticked, and I wrestled with the weight of both roles, unsure which path to choose."}
