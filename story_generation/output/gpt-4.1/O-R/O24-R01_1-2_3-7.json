I knew they expected a message rooted in compassion and faith, something that would resonate and inspire. But the law demanded precision, impartiality, and a certain detachment. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each pulling in a different direction. I felt the tension in my chest, the anxiety of not wanting to let anyone down.
