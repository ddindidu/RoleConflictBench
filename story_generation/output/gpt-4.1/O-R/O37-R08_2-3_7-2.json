The supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts. Safety and hygiene come first.\u201d I knew the protocols by heart, but lately, I\u2019d been rushing, skipping steps to finish early. Tonight, though, I couldn\u2019t afford to be late. The community study circle was meeting, and we were discussing Quranic verses I hadn\u2019t read yet. As a Muslim, I was expected to recite and reflect thoughtfully, to show respect for the words of Allah and the group\u2019s trust in me. But my shift was running long, and if I followed every cleaning step perfectly, I\u2019d miss the start of the circle. If I hurried, I\u2019d compromise safety\u2014something my job demanded I never do. My heart pounded with guilt and anxiety, torn between my duty to my work and my faith. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
