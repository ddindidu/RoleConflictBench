Suddenly, a red light flashed\u2014a brake system malfunction. My heart pounded. Protocol demanded I report it and stop the train immediately, for the safety of everyone on board. My hand hovered over the radio, but just then, my phone buzzed. It was Sarah, a member of my congregation. Her message was desperate: \u201cPastor, I need you. I don\u2019t know what to do. Please call me.\u201d I could hear the weight in her words, the kind of pain that can\u2019t wait. I was expected to be her shepherd, to offer comfort and guidance in her darkest hour. But right now, I was also responsible for hundreds of lives, expected to act swiftly and decisively as a subway operator.
