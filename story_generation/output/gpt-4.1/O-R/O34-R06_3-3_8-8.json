An emergency call crackled through my headset\u2014a passenger was gravely ill, and the flight needed to divert, cutting across three busy sectors. My training kicked in, and I started coordinating with the other controllers, my voice clipped and efficient. Every second mattered. But then, in the midst of the chaos, I heard a colleague\u2019s voice tremble. She was new, overwhelmed, and on the verge of tears. I knew what I should do as a Christian: offer comfort, show kindness, be present for her. But the demands of the job screamed for my full attention\u2014lives depended on my focus and quick decisions.

The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt torn, suspended between duty and compassion, unable to move."}
