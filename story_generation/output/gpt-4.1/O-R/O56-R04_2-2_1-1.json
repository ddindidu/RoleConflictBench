I smiled, setting down my scissors, and moved to greet her, remembering how important it was to make new clients feel welcome. \u201cHi there, how can I help you today?\u201d I asked, trying to put her at ease. Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from the mosque committee. The regular backup imam was away, and the congregation was gathering, expecting me to lead the prayer. My heart pounded. I glanced at the clock; the prayer time was fast approaching. The woman looked at me, hopeful and anxious, clearly needing reassurance. At the same time, I pictured the waiting congregants, relying on me for spiritual guidance. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to fulfill my duty. I stood there, caught between the gentle hum of the salon and the distant call to prayer, unsure which path to take."}
