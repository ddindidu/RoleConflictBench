The radio crackled: \u201cMinor delay at the next station. Adjust speed, but keep on schedule.\u201d My hands gripped the controls, calculating how to slow just enough without jostling the passengers. Punctuality was everything in this job\u2014people depended on me to get them to work, to school, to their lives, safely and on time.\n\nAs I prepared to ease the brakes, I noticed a man in the first car, slumped over, looking pale and distressed. My heart pounded. Was he ill? Should I stop the train and call for help, risking a major delay and breaking protocol? Or should I trust he\u2019d be okay until the next station, as the rules suggested, and keep the train moving?\n\nMy mind raced with the teachings I\u2019d grown up with\u2014love your neighbor, do unto others. But the weight of my responsibility as an operator pressed down on me. I felt torn, caught between the demands of my job and the call of my conscience, unsure which voice to follow as the train sped into the tunnel."}
