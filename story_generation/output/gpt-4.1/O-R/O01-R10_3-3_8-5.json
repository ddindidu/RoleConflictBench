The client is breathing down my neck, and my teams are stretched thin, tempers flaring as the deadline looms. Today, I overheard a heated argument in the break room\u2014one of the contractors bragged about cutting corners, using substandard materials to save time and money. My heart pounded. If I report this, the project could grind to a halt, and I\u2019d be failing everyone counting on me to deliver. But as a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to uphold dharma, to act with honesty and protect others from harm. The thought of people living or working in a building that isn\u2019t safe makes my stomach twist. My mind races with the expectations: the company needs me to keep things moving, but my conscience screams at me to speak up. I stand frozen in the corridor, torn between my duty as a project manager and my responsibility as a human being."}
