It was a rare day off, and I wore my comfortable, modest clothes\u2014loose pants and a long-sleeved shirt, just as my faith guides me. My mother was already preparing breakfast, and I looked forward to a peaceful day. But then my phone buzzed. It was my supervisor from the construction site. He needed me to come in, just for a few hours, to move a stack of unused materials to a different storage area before the end of the day. \n\nI knew what the job would require: heavy lifting, sweating under the sun, and probably getting dirty. The usual work clothes\u2014short sleeves, sometimes even shorts\u2014made it easier to move and stay cool. But I couldn\u2019t ignore my beliefs. I felt the pressure from both sides: my supervisor expected me to work efficiently, not slowed down by extra layers, while my faith expected me to dress modestly, even if it made the work harder. I stood in my room, staring at my closet, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
