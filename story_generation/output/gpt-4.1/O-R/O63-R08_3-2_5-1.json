The sales manager\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cWe\u2019re just a few deals away from the target. Everyone needs to push.\u201d My screen blinks with numbers, names, and scripts, but my thoughts drift to the Quran on my desk. Ramadan\u2019s midpoint is here, and I\u2019m behind on my daily reading. I promised myself I\u2019d catch up tonight, to recite and reflect as I should, but the calls keep coming. Each ring is a reminder of the bonus I need, the penalties I fear. Yet, every minute spent dialing is a minute lost from the quiet reflection I crave. My heart aches with guilt\u2014am I neglecting my faith for my job, or my job for my faith? The clock ticks, and I stare at the Quran, torn between the demands of my livelihood and the peace I find in my faith, unsure which voice to answer first."}
