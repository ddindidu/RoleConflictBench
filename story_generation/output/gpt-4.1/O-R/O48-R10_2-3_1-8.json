His surgery had left him weak, and every movement needed my full attention. As a nursing assistant, I knew my duty was to make sure he was safe and comfortable, especially now when he needed extra help to get dressed and move around. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from my family about the festival. Today was the start of Navratri, and my family had already traveled hours to the temple. They expected me to join them, to participate in the rituals and offerings, to be present for the prayers that only happen once a year. My heart ached with the weight of both worlds. I could see the trust in Mr. Patel\u2019s eyes, and I could hear my mother\u2019s voice in my mind, urging me not to miss the festival. I felt torn, caught between the needs of my patient and the pull of my faith, unsure which path to follow as the minutes ticked by."}
