I knew I had to review it thoroughly before the next session. The expectation was clear: a judge must stay current, must weigh every precedent, must not let anything slip by. Yet, as I reached for the case file, my phone buzzed with a message from my mother: \u201cHave you thought about Hajj this year? You\u2019re not getting any younger, and it\u2019s important.\u201d The weight of her words pressed on me. As a Muslim, performing Hajj is a sacred duty, one I had promised myself I would fulfill as soon as I could. But the reality was harsh\u2014my early career salary barely covered my needs, let alone the cost of pilgrimage. I felt torn, the demands of my profession and my faith pulling me in opposite directions. The law required my full attention, but my heart ached with the longing to answer a higher call. I stared at the legal brief, my mind swirling with questions, caught between two worlds that both demanded everything from me."}
