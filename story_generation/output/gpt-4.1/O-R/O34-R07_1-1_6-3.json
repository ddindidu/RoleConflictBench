The clock ticks closer to the ten-minute window I\u2019ve set aside for meditation\u2014a promise to myself to practice mindfulness amid the chaos. My breath slows, and I prepare to close my eyes, to let go of the constant chatter. But just as I\u2019m about to begin, a blip on the screen catches my attention: Flight 482 is approaching the sector boundary, ready to hand off to the next controller. Protocol demands I coordinate with the neighboring sector, confirm the handoff, and ensure the airspace remains safe and orderly. My colleagues expect me to be alert, responsive, a seamless part of the team. Yet, my heart aches for the stillness I crave, the quiet I promised myself. The demands of the tower and the demands of my practice pull at me, each insistent, each urgent. My fingers hover over the radio, my mind torn between duty and devotion, the noise of the world and the silence within."}
