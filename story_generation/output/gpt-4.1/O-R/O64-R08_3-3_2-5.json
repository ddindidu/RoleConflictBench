As a cashier, I was responsible for closing out the register, counting every bill and coin with precision. Today, the transactions were unusually high, and the pressure to avoid mistakes weighed heavily on me. My manager expected nothing less than perfect accuracy, especially with so much money at stake. But as I glanced at my watch, I realized it was nearly time for Jummah prayer. As a Muslim, I needed to change into my modest attire before entering the main prayer hall. The expectation was clear: I should be dressed appropriately, ready to join the congregation. My heart pounded as I looked at the stack of receipts and the cash drawer, knowing I couldn\u2019t rush the process without risking errors. Yet, the thought of missing the prayer or entering the hall improperly dressed filled me with guilt. I stood there, torn between the demands of my job and my faith, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
