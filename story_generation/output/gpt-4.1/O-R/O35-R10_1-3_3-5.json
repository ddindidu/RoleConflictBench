A passenger\u2019s voice crackled through, asking for directions to the city library. I was about to respond when, through the window of the next car, I caught sight of a transit officer slipping a wallet from a sleeping commuter\u2019s bag. My heart pounded. As a subway operator, my duty was clear: keep the train running smoothly, answer passengers\u2019 questions, and ensure everyone\u2019s safety. But as a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma\u2014righteousness\u2014and never ignore wrongdoing. The passenger\u2019s voice repeated, \u201cExcuse me, can you help me?\u201d while the officer glanced around, pocketing the wallet. I felt torn, my hands gripping the controls. Should I break protocol and report the officer immediately, risking chaos and neglecting my passengers? Or should I fulfill my operator duties and address the wrongdoing later, knowing that justice delayed might be justice denied? The train sped on, and I was caught between the demands of my job and the call of my conscience."}
