The first-time client in my chair stared at her reflection, lips pressed tight, eyes flickering with disappointment. I could feel her expectation\u2014she wanted me to fix it, to listen, to make it right. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of the time. Friday prayers were less than an hour away. As the imam, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah, to guide the congregation, to be present in both body and spirit. But today, the guest speaker was ready, his notes in hand, prepared to step in if I couldn\u2019t make it. My heart pounded as I weighed the client\u2019s growing frustration against the sacred duty awaiting me at the mosque. I could see both worlds pulling at me\u2014one demanding my professional care and attention, the other my spiritual leadership. I stood there, scissors in hand, caught between the mirror and the minbar, unsure which expectation I would have to let down."}
