The foreman\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cKeep it moving, we\u2019re on a tight schedule!\u201d I could see the carpenter waiting, tapping his foot, eyes searching for me. I knew if I didn\u2019t get him the next stack soon, the whole crew would be delayed. My job was clear: work hard, don\u2019t slow anyone down.\n\nBut as I passed the break area, I caught sight of Miguel, slumped on a bench, head in his hands. He\u2019d been quiet all morning, and I remembered the prayer group mentioning his family troubles. My heart tugged at me\u2014wasn\u2019t I supposed to show compassion, to be there for others in their pain? The teachings of Jesus rang in my ears: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d Yet, the weight of the lumber in my hands reminded me of my duty to the team.\n\nI stood frozen for a moment, torn between the urgent call of my job and the quiet plea of my faith, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
