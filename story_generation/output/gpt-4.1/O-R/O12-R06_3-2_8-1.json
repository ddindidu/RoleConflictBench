My heart pounded as I traced the issue back to a piece of code I\u2019d written last week. Customers were locked out, and the team was looking to me for a fix\u2014fast. My manager messaged, \u201cWe need a root cause analysis for the client, but keep it high-level. Don\u2019t mention your code.\u201d I knew what he meant: gloss over the details, protect the company, avoid blame. But as a Christian, honesty is non-negotiable. I stared at the draft report, my fingers hovering over the keyboard. If I told the whole truth, I risked my reputation and maybe my job. If I followed my manager\u2019s lead, I\u2019d be complicit in a half-truth. The pressure from both sides was crushing\u2014my duty to my team and company, and my commitment to integrity. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the weight of both roles, knowing I had to choose which expectation to honor."}
