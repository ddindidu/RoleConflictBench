The broken lane rope floated limply, threatening to tangle swimmers and disrupt the lessons scheduled for the afternoon. As the senior lifeguard, it was my responsibility to fix it before the children arrived, to keep the facility safe and running smoothly. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from my doctor about my health, and a message from my family: \u201cThis year is your chance for Hajj. The doctor says you may not be able to travel next year.\u201d The weight of my faith pressed on me. Hajj is a pillar, a once-in-a-lifetime duty, and my heart ached at the thought of missing it. Yet, the pool needed me now, and my team relied on me to keep things in order. I stared at the broken rope, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the sacred call of my faith, feeling the tension coil inside me, unsure which duty I could bear to set aside."}
