My manager expects me to be precise, to never let a cent slip by, and I take pride in my accuracy. But as I hand a receipt to a customer, my mind drifts to the conversation I had with my mother last night. She reminded me that, as a Muslim, performing Hajj is a duty I must fulfill when I am able. I feel the weight of that expectation pressing on me, but my paycheck barely covers rent and groceries, let alone the cost of a pilgrimage to Mecca. Each beep of the scanner is a reminder of how far I am from saving enough. I want to be a good employee, to keep this job, but I also want to be a good Muslim, to fulfill my religious obligation. The two roles pull at me from opposite sides, and I feel caught in the middle, unsure how I can meet both demands."}
