The carpenter glanced at me, impatience flickering in his eyes. He needed the next load quickly so he could keep working, and I knew the foreman would be watching, expecting me to keep the materials coming without delay. My muscles ached, but I pushed myself harder, not wanting to let anyone down.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the festival. Today was the day of the important puja, and my family had already left for the temple, traveling hours to reach the sacred site. As a Hindu, I was expected to be there, to join in the prayers, the offerings, the rituals that only happened once a year. My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me of my duty to our faith and ancestors.\n\nI felt torn, caught between the demands of my job and the pull of my religion. The weight on my shoulders was more than just the lumber; it was the burden of choosing between two worlds, each expecting my full devotion. I stood there, heart pounding, unsure which path to take."}
