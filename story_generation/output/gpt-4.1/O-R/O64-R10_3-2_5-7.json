The end of my shift was minutes away, and the line of customers seemed endless. As a cashier, I knew I couldn\u2019t rush the large cash deposit waiting for me in the back office. Store policy was clear: every bill counted, every form filled, no shortcuts. The manager had warned us\u2014mistakes meant audits, and audits meant trouble. But tonight was different. My family was waiting for me at home, the house already filled with the scent of incense and marigolds. It was the night of our festival, and as a Hindu, I was expected to arrive on time, dressed in my best, to join the prayers and rituals. My mother had called twice, reminding me not to be late. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me\u2014my duty to my job, and my devotion to my faith and family. I stared at the deposit bag, my hands trembling, torn between the rules of the store and the traditions of my home."}
