I glanced at the screen\u2014urgent: main production unit down, sensor errors, thirty minutes and counting. My mind immediately began mapping out possible causes, the familiar logic of diagnostics kicking in. But before I could respond, Sister Agnes burst in, her face pale. \u201cThe mayor is here. He needs you. The hurricane\u2019s left so many without homes. He says you\u2019re the only one who can organize the relief effort.\u201d My heart twisted. As a nun, I was expected to serve, to be present for those in need, especially now, when the community was reeling. Yet, as a machine repairer, I knew the factory\u2019s halt meant lost wages for dozens of families\u2014families who might soon need that very relief. Both roles demanded my full attention, both urgent, both vital. I felt torn, the weight of expectation pressing from all sides, my mind racing as I stood between the mayor and my ringing phone, unable to move."}
