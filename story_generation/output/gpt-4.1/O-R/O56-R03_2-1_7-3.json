The strands clung together, greasy and tangled, and I knew she expected the full treatment\u2014wash, condition, and style\u2014before her important meeting. My fingers worked the shampoo through her scalp, but my mind was already drifting to the convent\u2019s bell, which would soon ring for morning prayers. As a nun, I was expected to be present in the main chapel, joining my sisters in our daily devotion, a sacred rhythm that shaped our lives. The weight of both worlds pressed on me: the trust of my client, who relied on my skill and care, and the silent expectation of my religious community, who counted on my presence and commitment. My heart pounded as I rinsed the suds away, torn between the hum of the hairdryer and the solemn hush of the chapel, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
