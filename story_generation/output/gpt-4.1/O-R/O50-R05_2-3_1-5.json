The supervisor hovered, his voice tight: \u201cWe\u2019re losing thousands every minute. We need you to find the fault\u2014now.\u201d I nodded, heart pounding, scanning the tangled wires and blinking sensors, mind racing through possible causes. But my phone vibrated, and I glanced at the screen: a reminder for Rivka\u2019s final study session before her Beit Din. She\u2019d waited months for this, her questions growing deeper, her anticipation palpable. As her rabbi, I was expected to guide her through the last, crucial teachings, to answer her doubts and help her prepare spiritually for the most important moment of her life. I could picture her waiting, anxious and hopeful, expecting my full attention and wisdom. Yet here, the factory\u2019s demands pressed in, the weight of lost time and money heavy on my shoulders. I felt torn, pulled by the urgent needs of both worlds, each expecting my undivided presence. My hands trembled, caught between the wrench and the Torah, between the machine\u2019s silence and the soul\u2019s longing."}
