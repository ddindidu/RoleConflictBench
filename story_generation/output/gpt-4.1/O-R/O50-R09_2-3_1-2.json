The production line had been down for half an hour, and the supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford more delays\u2014find the fault, fast.\u201d My phone vibrated in my pocket. A message from my wife: \u201cHe\u2019s struggling with the Torah portion. Can you come home early to help him practice? The bar mitzvah is so soon.\u201d I pictured my son\u2019s anxious face, the way he looked to me for guidance, for reassurance that he could do this. But here, surrounded by blinking lights and frustrated coworkers, I was the only one who could fix the sensor error. The pressure to get the machines running warred with the responsibility to guide my child through this milestone. My hands trembled\u2014not from the tools, but from the weight of being needed in two places at once, each demanding all of me."}
