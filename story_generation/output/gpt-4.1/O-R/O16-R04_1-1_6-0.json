My patient, a young man with a sore throat and fever, sat across from me, waiting for my diagnosis. As a doctor, I knew I needed to prescribe antibiotics for his strep throat and explain the importance of completing the course. Yet, as I reached for my prescription pad, my phone buzzed with a reminder: it was nearly time for the midday prayer at the mosque. As the imam, I was expected to lead, but today, the congregation was small and another worshipper, fully qualified, was present and willing to step in.\n\nStill, I felt the pull of duty. The community looked to me for spiritual guidance, and even a small group deserved my presence. But my patient needed my full attention, and I couldn\u2019t rush through his care. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of my profession and my faith, the stethoscope around my neck feeling heavier with every passing second."}
