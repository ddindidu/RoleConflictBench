The contractor was clear: the project had to be finished by Friday, and any delay would set the whole team back. My phone buzzed on the workbench. It was a message from Mrs. Evans, letting me know that Tom, one of our congregation, was having a rough week. I knew he\u2019d been struggling since his wife passed, and as his pastor, I felt a deep responsibility to check in, maybe sit with him for a while, offer a prayer or just a listening ear. But the clock was ticking, and the crew was waiting for my part to be done before they could move forward. I stared at the unfinished cabinet, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. Each role called to me, each with its own urgency, and I stood there, torn, unsure which demand to answer first."}
