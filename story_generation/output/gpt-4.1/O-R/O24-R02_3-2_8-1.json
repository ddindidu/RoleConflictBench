Suddenly, my clerk slipped me a note\u2014urgent, trembling. The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was explaining. My mind raced. As a judge, I was expected to stay current, to uphold the law as it stood, not as it was a moment ago. I had to stop, reconsider, perhaps even call a recess. But the clock on the wall reminded me of another duty: the main weekly service at my church was about to begin, and as the priest, my congregation expected me to lead them in prayer, to be present, to guide their faith. Both roles demanded my immediate attention, both communities relying on me for guidance and stability. My heart pounded with the weight of their expectations, torn between the law and the spirit, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
