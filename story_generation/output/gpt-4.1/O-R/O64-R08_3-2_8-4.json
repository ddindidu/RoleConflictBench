I force a smile as the next customer slams her items on the counter, her voice sharp and accusing about a sale price. My manager\u2019s eyes flick over, reminding me to stay cheerful, to be the calm in the holiday storm. I nod, apologizing, my hands steady even as my heart pounds. But beneath my uniform, I\u2019m uneasy. The office function is this afternoon, and the memo said \u201cfestive attire\u201d\u2014something bright, something fun. My colleagues will be there, men and women, and I know the expectation: to blend in, to look the part. But my faith asks for modesty, for sleeves that reach my wrists and a scarf that covers my hair. I can already hear the questions, the curious glances. I want to be a good coworker, a friendly face behind the register, but I also want to honor my beliefs.
