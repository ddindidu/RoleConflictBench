My inspection revealed a troubling rattle\u2014something was wrong with the filter. If I didn\u2019t address it now, the water could become unsafe, putting everyone at risk. As a lifeguard, I knew my duty: safety first, always. But my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder from my Buddhist teacher. The temple session was tomorrow, and I was to present a summary of the key teachings. I hadn\u2019t even started. The expectation was clear: to honor my commitment, to reflect deeply, and to share insights with the sangha. My mind raced, torn between the urgent, practical responsibility at the pool and the quiet, spiritual obligation at the temple. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each vital in its own way. My heart pounded as I stared at the faulty filter, the sacred texts still unopened in my bag, caught in the tension of two worlds that suddenly seemed impossibly far apart."}
