As a taxi driver, I prided myself on keeping my car clean and welcoming, knowing that every customer expected a professional, hygienic ride. But as I checked my phone, a pang of anxiety hit me. Sunset was approaching, and I hadn\u2019t yet lit the lamp or offered my evening prayers at my home altar, a daily ritual that grounded me as a Hindu. My mother\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNever let the day end without your prayers.\u201d Yet, the app pinged\u2014a new ride request, just a few minutes away. If I accepted, I\u2019d miss my ritual. If I declined, my rating might drop, and I\u2019d lose precious income. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, torn between the duty to my passengers and the devotion to my faith, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in from either side."}
