The safety audit was in two days, and I\u2019d already been warned about the aging centrifuge and the loose gas valve. As the lab\u2019s lead scientist, it was my responsibility to ensure every piece of equipment was up to code, every protocol followed. My supervisor\u2019s email was clear: \u201cNo more oversights, please.\u201d\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series was tonight. As the parish priest, I was expected to guide the team, inspire new ideas, and set the tone for the coming season. Parents and catechists were counting on me to be present, to listen, to lead.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I stayed late at the lab, I could fix the flagged issues and avoid another warning. If I left now, I\u2019d be at the church in time to welcome everyone, to show them their spiritual growth mattered. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which expectation I would have to let down."}
