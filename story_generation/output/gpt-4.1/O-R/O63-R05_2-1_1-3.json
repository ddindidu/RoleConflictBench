My script only skimmed the surface, and I felt the familiar anxiety rise. I was supposed to handle objections, keep the call moving, but she wanted real answers. I glanced at the clock. In twenty minutes, I was supposed to be at the synagogue, leading the adult education class. It was optional, but I knew several regulars would be there, expecting me to guide them through the week\u2019s Torah portion, to answer their questions with patience and depth. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t let them off the hook. Keep them engaged.\u201d But as a rabbi, I was expected to be present, attentive, a source of wisdom and calm. My stomach twisted. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, couldn\u2019t meet both sets of expectations. The woman on the phone waited for my answer, and my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cAdult Ed class in 15 minutes.\u201d I closed my eyes, torn between two worlds."}
