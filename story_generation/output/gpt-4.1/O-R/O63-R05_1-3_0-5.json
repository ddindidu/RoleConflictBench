The calls today were easy\u2014most people listened politely, and the few questions they had were ones I\u2019d answered a hundred times. I felt the rhythm of the work, the comfort of routine. Then my phone buzzed with a reminder: in fifteen minutes, I was supposed to meet with Miriam, the conversion candidate. This was her last study session before her Beit Din, the culmination of months of learning. She was nervous, and I knew how much she needed my guidance and reassurance.\n\nBut my supervisor had just asked me to stay on the line for another hour\u2014apparently, we were close to hitting a daily target. I could hear the expectation in his voice, the unspoken pressure to be a team player. At the same time, I felt the weight of my responsibility as a rabbi, the promise I\u2019d made to Miriam, and the sacredness of her journey. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the demands of my job and the calling of my faith, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
