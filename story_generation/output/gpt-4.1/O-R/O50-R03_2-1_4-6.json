The temperature gauges blinked red\u2014three of the presses were running hotter than they should, a direct result of missing their last maintenance. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a breakdown. Keep them running smooth.\u201d I knew what was expected of me. I reached for my toolkit, but my gaze drifted to the small clock on the wall. It was nearly time for afternoon silence, the hour I\u2019d set aside for spiritual reading and reflection. As a nun, I was expected to honor these moments, to nurture my soul and deepen my faith. The convent was quiet, the other sisters already in their cells, and I felt the weight of my commitment to God pressing gently but firmly on my heart. My hands hovered between the wrench and my worn prayer book. The machines needed me, but so did my spirit. The demands of both worlds pulled at me, and I stood there, torn, the noise of the machines and the promise of silence battling within me."}
