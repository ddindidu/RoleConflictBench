My phone buzzed\u2014a new client, polite but clearly lost, asked if I could walk them through the basics of their new machine. I could hear the anxiety in their voice, and I knew how overwhelming unfamiliar equipment could be. As a machine repairer, I prided myself on being patient and thorough, always making sure clients felt confident and supported. But my laptop screen was filled with half-finished notes for my Shabbat sermon, and the words I needed to inspire my congregation still eluded me. The community expected wisdom and presence from their rabbi, especially as the sun set and the week\u2019s worries faded into sacred time. My heart pounded as I weighed the client\u2019s need for reassurance against my responsibility to my congregation. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, uncertain which expectation I could afford to disappoint."}
