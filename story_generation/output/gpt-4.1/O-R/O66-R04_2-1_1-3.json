A young man rushed in, breathless, clutching his ticket. \u201cPlease, my train leaves in twenty minutes. Can you get me to the station?\u201d I glanced at the dashboard clock, calculating the route and the traffic. As a taxi driver, I knew my duty: deliver him safely and on time. But my phone vibrated with a message from the mosque committee\u2014reminding me of the Friday prayer. I was the imam, expected to deliver the Khutbah. The congregation looked to me for guidance, but today, a guest speaker was ready, just in case. My heart pounded. If I drove fast, I might make it back in time, but what if I didn\u2019t? Would the community feel let down? Yet, if I refused the ride, I\u2019d fail this passenger who trusted me to help him catch his train. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, and I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the road ahead and the pulpit waiting behind."}
