His train was leaving in twenty minutes, and the station was clear across town. As a taxi driver, I knew he was counting on me to get him there safely and quickly. The city traffic was thick, but I could take a few shortcuts, maybe push the speed limit a little. My hands tightened on the wheel, but my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Maria: the family next door had lost everything in a fire. They needed help\u2014food, clothing, comfort\u2014right now. As a nun, I was expected to be there, to serve and support those in crisis. My heart ached, torn between the desperate look in my passenger\u2019s eyes and the urgent plea from my community. I could only be in one place, but both needed me. The weight of both uniforms pressed on my shoulders as I reached the next intersection, caught between duty and compassion, unsure which road to take."}
