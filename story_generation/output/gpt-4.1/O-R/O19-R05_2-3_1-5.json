She depended on these medications to keep her heart and diabetes in check, and I knew any mistake could be dangerous. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the conversion candidate\u2019s final study session was in fifteen minutes. He had worked so hard, and this session would determine if he was ready for the Beit Din. As a rabbi, I was expected to guide him, to be present and attentive, especially now. But the pharmacy was short-staffed, and the line was growing. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my duty to ensure Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s safety, and my responsibility to shepherd a soul at a pivotal moment. My hands trembled as I counted the pills, my mind torn between the demands of healing the body and nurturing the spirit."}
