The defendant\u2019s anxious face haunted me; the law required me to write a clear, detailed order for his release, and I knew every word mattered. The court expected precision and speed\u2014he couldn\u2019t leave custody until I finished. My robe felt heavy with the weight of responsibility.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from my church group: Sarah, a friend, was in crisis. She needed someone to talk to, someone to pray with her. As a Christian, I felt a deep pull to show compassion, to be present for her as Jesus would be. Yet, the clock ticked, and the defendant\u2019s freedom depended on my swift action.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at the blank order on my screen, torn between the demands of justice and the call to love. I wrestled with the impossible choice\u2014fulfill my duty to the court, or answer the call to care for a friend in need."}
