Dispatch had said it was a possible heart attack\u2014every second mattered. I glanced at the dashboard clock. 6:55 a.m. In five minutes, the chapel bell would ring, calling all the sisters to morning prayer. As a nun, I was expected to be present, kneeling in silent devotion with my sisters, my heart and mind focused on God. But as an ambulance driver, my duty was to the patient whose life might depend on my swift response and calm care.\n\nMy habit felt heavy on my shoulders, a reminder of my vows and the rhythm of convent life. Yet the uniform beneath it, the stethoscope in my pocket, pulled me in another direction. I could almost hear Mother Superior\u2019s gentle voice, reminding me of the importance of community prayer. At the same time, I pictured the patient\u2019s face, pale and frightened, waiting for help that only I could bring. My heart pounded with the weight of both callings, torn between the chapel\u2019s peace and the urgency of the road ahead."}
