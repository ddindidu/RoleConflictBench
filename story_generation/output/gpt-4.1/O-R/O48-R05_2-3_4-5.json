Still, protocol demanded I monitor her again in fifteen minutes. My phone buzzed in my pocket: a reminder for the conversion candidate\u2019s final study session. He\u2019d been preparing for months, and this was the last chance to review before his Beit Din. I knew how much this meant to him, how much he relied on my guidance as his rabbi. But here, in my scrubs, I was responsible for my patient\u2019s safety. The nurse in me knew I couldn\u2019t leave Mrs. Goldstein unattended, not with her recent procedure and these numbers. The rabbi in me felt the weight of spiritual responsibility, the promise I\u2019d made to be present for this pivotal moment. I stood in the hallway, torn, the beeping of monitors and the echo of ancient words both calling me, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait."}
