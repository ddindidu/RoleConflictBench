The project was still in its early stages, nothing set in stone, but my manager wanted me to join a brainstorming session tonight\u2014an opportunity to pitch new ideas, to shape the direction from the ground up. As an engineer, I felt the pull of responsibility, the excitement of possibility, and the unspoken expectation to be present, to contribute.\n\nBut tonight was also the regular synagogue service. I\u2019d promised myself to attend consistently, to be part of the community, to honor my faith. Even though the minyan would likely have enough people without me, I knew my absence would be noticed by a few, and I\u2019d feel the weight of missing out on something meaningful, something grounding.\n\nI stared at my calendar, the two events overlapping. The pressure built inside me\u2014my professional drive clashing with my spiritual commitment. I wanted to be both the reliable engineer and the devoted Jew, but tonight, I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My hands trembled slightly as I weighed the expectations, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing minute."}
