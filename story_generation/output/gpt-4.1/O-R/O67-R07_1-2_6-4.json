My shift is almost over, and I\u2019m supposed to move the vehicle to the satellite station for the next crew. The radio crackles with routine updates, but my mind is elsewhere. Today is the weekly group meditation at the temple\u2014a sacred hour I look forward to all week, a time to practice mindfulness and reconnect with my breath. The expectation is clear: I should be present, calm, and centered with my sangha.\n\nBut the clock is ticking. If I drive too cautiously, I\u2019ll miss the meditation. If I rush, I risk the safety of the ambulance and everyone on the road. My heart pounds with the weight of both roles. The city blurs past, and I feel the tug-of-war inside me\u2014duty to my job, duty to my practice. I can almost hear the chanting begin in my mind, even as the siren\u2019s echo lingers in my ears. I glance at the dashboard clock, torn between the demands of the world and the call of inner peace, not yet knowing which path I\u2019ll choose."}
