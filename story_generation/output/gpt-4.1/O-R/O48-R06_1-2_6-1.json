He looked up, his eyes tired but hopeful. \u201cCould you stay a while?\u201d he asked, voice trembling. As a nursing assistant, I knew how important it was to provide comfort and companionship, especially to patients like Mr. Harris who rarely had visitors. I pulled up a chair, ready to listen.\n\nAs we talked, he confided in me about his regrets and fears, and then, almost in a whisper, he asked if I could help him with something that went against my Christian beliefs. My heart pounded. I wanted to be there for him, to ease his loneliness and pain, but the request clashed with the values I hold dear. The expectation to support my patient warred with my commitment to live by my faith. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure how to honor both without betraying one."}
