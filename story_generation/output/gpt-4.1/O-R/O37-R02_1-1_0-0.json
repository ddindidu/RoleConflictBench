The living room still needed vacuuming, and the bathroom mirror was streaked with toothpaste. As the housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to keep the house spotless, but lately, I\u2019d only managed to tidy up the obvious messes and do a quick sweep of the shared spaces. My supervisor\u2019s reminders echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cWe expect thoroughness, not just surface cleaning.\u201d\n\nBut today, the optional daily prayer service I was supposed to lead as a priest was about to begin. The community looked to me for spiritual guidance, even if this service wasn\u2019t mandatory. I knew some of them found comfort in these moments, and I felt responsible for their peace of mind. My phone buzzed with a message: \u201cWill you be leading prayers today?\u201d I stared at the half-cleaned room, my cleaning supplies in one hand and my prayer book in the other, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. I couldn\u2019t ignore either expectation, but I couldn\u2019t fulfill both at once. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the demands of cleanliness and the call to spiritual duty."}
