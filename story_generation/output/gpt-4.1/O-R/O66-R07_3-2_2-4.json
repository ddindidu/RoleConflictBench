My passenger, a nervous businessman, checks his watch for the third time in as many minutes. \u201cPlease, I can\u2019t miss this flight,\u201d he pleads, his voice tight with anxiety. I know the airport is still a good forty minutes away in normal weather, but today, the roads are slick and slow. As a taxi driver, I feel the pressure to get him there safely and on time, to be the reliable link in his journey. But my phone buzzes with a gentle reminder: the weekly meditation group starts in ten minutes. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to be present, to cultivate calm and mindfulness, to sit with my sangha and nurture peace within myself. The storm outside mirrors the storm inside me\u2014torn between the urgency of my passenger\u2019s need and the quiet commitment to my own spiritual practice. My hands grip the wheel, my mind racing, caught between the demands of the road and the call to stillness."}
