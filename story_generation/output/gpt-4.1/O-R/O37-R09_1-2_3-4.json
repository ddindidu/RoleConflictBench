The list was long, and I was expected to make sure nothing ran out\u2014no excuses. My supervisor had been clear: if we ran out of anything, it would be on me. As I counted the bottles, my stomach growled. I glanced at the clock. Lunch break was coming up, but I was far from home, working in a new part of town. I remembered there was only one small vendor nearby, a place I\u2019d heard was kosher-certified. If I didn\u2019t eat there, I\u2019d have to wait until I got home, hours later. But if I left now, I\u2019d risk not finishing the inventory on time, and the supplies order would be delayed. My job demanded I stay and finish, but my faith demanded I eat only kosher food, and this was my only window. I felt the pressure building inside me, torn between my responsibility as a cleaner and my commitment as a Jew, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy both at once."}
