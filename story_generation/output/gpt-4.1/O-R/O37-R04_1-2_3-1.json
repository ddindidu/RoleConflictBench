The backup imam was still out of town, and the congregation was gathering for the midday prayer. I glanced at the nearly empty shelf of disinfectant and the list of items I still needed to order. My supervisor expected a full inventory report by the end of my shift, and I knew she\u2019d be frustrated if I left it incomplete. But as imam, the community looked to me for guidance and spiritual leadership, especially now when no one else could lead the prayer. My heart pounded as I weighed the responsibility of ensuring a clean, well-stocked facility against the sacred duty of leading my community in worship. Both roles demanded my presence, both were urgent, and I felt the pressure of letting someone down no matter what I chose. I stood frozen in the supply closet, torn between the mop and the prayer mat, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
