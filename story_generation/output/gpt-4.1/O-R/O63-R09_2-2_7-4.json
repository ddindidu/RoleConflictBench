The phone queue is relentless, and management has sent two reminders today about sticking to our scheduled breaks\u2014no exceptions. I\u2019m supposed to log out for lunch in exactly five minutes, but I know every second away from my desk is scrutinized. My stomach growls, and I remember the kosher vendor a few blocks away\u2014the only place I can eat without breaking my dietary laws. It\u2019s a ten-minute walk each way, and I\u2019ll need time to order and eat. There\u2019s no way I can make it back within my allotted break. If I stay, I\u2019ll go hungry or have to eat something that isn\u2019t kosher, betraying my commitment to my faith. If I go, I risk a reprimand or worse from my supervisor. My hands tremble as I hover over the break button, torn between the demands of my job and the expectations of my faith, feeling the weight of both pressing in on me."}
