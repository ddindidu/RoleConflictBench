I slipped into my most comfortable pajamas\u2014short sleeves and loose pants, perfect for lounging but not quite meeting the modesty I usually uphold outside. Just as I settled in, my phone buzzed. The pharmacy was short-staffed, and a regular patient with complex chronic conditions needed their medications urgently. I was the only one who knew the intricacies of their prescription. My mind raced. As a pharmacist, I knew the patient depended on me to dispense their medications accurately and safely. But as a Muslim, I felt the weight of my commitment to dress modestly, even if I was just running a quick errand. I stared at my reflection, torn between the urgency of my professional duty and the personal expectations of my faith. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands of both roles, feeling the tension rise with every passing second."}
