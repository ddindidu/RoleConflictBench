The new office design was due tomorrow, and every detail mattered\u2014lighting, flow, comfort. My phone buzzed with reminders: \u201cDon\u2019t forget the festival service tonight.\u201d As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers for our most sacred holiday, a night when the temple would be filled with hope and expectation. My congregation needed me to guide them, to be present, to offer words that would carry them through the year. But the office project was at a critical stage; my client depended on me to deliver a plan that would shape their business for years.
