The nurse\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cThe ventilator\u2019s failing. We need you now.\u201d My heart pounded, knowing a life hung in the balance. As I reached the ICU, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the children\u2019s holiday lesson. The holiday was just days away, and I\u2019d promised to teach them the blessings, to pass on the traditions my parents had given me. I could picture their eager faces, waiting for stories and songs, for the warmth of our shared heritage. But here, in this sterile room, a different kind of urgency pressed on me. The machine\u2019s alarms screamed, demanding my focus, my skill. I felt torn, pulled between the sacred duty to preserve life and the equally sacred duty to nurture faith. My hands hovered over the ventilator\u2019s panel, but my mind was with the children, the blessings unsaid. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I stood frozen, caught between two calls I could not ignore."}
