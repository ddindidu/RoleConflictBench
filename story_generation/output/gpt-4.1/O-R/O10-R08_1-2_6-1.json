It was from one of our regular vendors\u2014a standard automated confirmation of the payment I\u2019d processed yesterday. Company policy was clear: every confirmation, no matter how routine, deserved a formal reply. I opened a draft, fingers poised over the keyboard, but my mind wandered. Ramadan had reached its midpoint, and I was already behind on my daily Quran reading. The guilt pressed on me; I\u2019d promised myself to catch up today, to not let work crowd out my spiritual commitments. Yet here I was, expected to be the diligent accountant, responsive and professional, while the quiet voice inside reminded me of my duty as a Muslim\u2014to recite, to reflect, to reconnect. The minutes ticked by, each one a tug-of-war between the demands of my job and the longing in my heart to fulfill my faith. I stared at the screen, torn, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which to answer first."}
