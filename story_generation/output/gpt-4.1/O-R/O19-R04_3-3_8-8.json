My notepad was already filled with scribbles about new drug interactions and treatment protocols\u2014information I needed to keep my license and serve my patients well. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the message: someone at the mosque needed me. I was the imam, too, and a community member had just suffered a devastating loss. He was waiting, desperate for comfort and guidance, and I knew how much my presence could mean in this moment of grief.\n\nMy mind raced. The seminar was mandatory, and missing it could jeopardize my standing as a pharmacist. But the pain in that man\u2019s eyes haunted me; as an imam, I was expected to be there, to listen, to offer solace. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between duty and compassion, between my profession and my calling."}
