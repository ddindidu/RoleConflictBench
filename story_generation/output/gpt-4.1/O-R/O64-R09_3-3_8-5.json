I force a smile as the next customer slams a box of pastries on the counter, voice sharp, demanding a refund for a mix-up. My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cStay calm, be friendly, no matter what.\u201d I nod, apologize, and try to soothe her, even as my heart pounds with the pressure of the holiday rush.\n\nLater, at the staff holiday party, I scan the buffet table. The platters are piled high, but none of the food is kosher-certified. My coworkers urge me to try the special pastries, their faces expectant, and I feel their eyes on me. I want to fit in, to be part of the team, to show gratitude for their hard work. But my faith tugs at me, reminding me of the rules I\u2019ve kept since childhood. My stomach twists with hunger and anxiety, caught between the warmth of belonging and the quiet voice of tradition."}
