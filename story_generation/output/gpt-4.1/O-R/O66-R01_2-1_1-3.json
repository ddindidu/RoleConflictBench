His train was leaving in twenty minutes, and the station was clear across town. As a taxi driver, I knew he expected me to get him there quickly and safely, weaving through traffic but never crossing the line into recklessness. My hands tightened on the wheel as I calculated the best route, my mind racing with shortcuts and traffic lights.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Lee, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her pastor, I\u2019d promised to check in whenever I could. The message was brief: \u201cHaving a hard day. Could use a prayer.\u201d I felt a pang of guilt. She needed comfort, a gentle word, maybe even a call. But my passenger\u2019s anxious glances in the rearview mirror reminded me of my other duty\u2014getting him to his train on time.\n\nMy heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides. Should I pull over for a moment to call Mrs. Lee, risking my passenger\u2019s schedule? Or focus on the road, leaving her to wait for comfort she needed now?"}
