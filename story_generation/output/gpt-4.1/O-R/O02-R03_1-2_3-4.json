The audit was still weeks away, but I knew the documentation needed careful review\u2014every detail had to be perfect to meet the strict safety standards. My supervisor trusted me to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks. As I highlighted a section on emergency protocols, my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes: a special healing service was being held tonight for Sister Maria, who had fallen gravely ill. Attendance was expected; our presence was a sign of unity and faith. I glanced at the clock, calculating how much I could finish before evening prayers, but the work was more complex than I\u2019d hoped. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my duty to my colleagues and the safety of our project, and toward my sisters, who needed my prayers and support. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt the familiar ache of being split between two worlds, each demanding all of me."}
