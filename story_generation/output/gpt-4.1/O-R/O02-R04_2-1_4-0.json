The new safety standard would take effect tomorrow, and I was responsible for ensuring our product met every requirement before release. The documentation was incomplete, and the evidence of conformity wasn\u2019t ready. My manager expected me to stay late, double-check every detail, and submit the final report tonight. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: Maghrib prayer was in half an hour. As the imam, I was expected to lead, even though the congregation was small and another qualified brother was present. I knew the community valued my presence, especially the elders who found comfort in my familiar voice. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my duty to uphold safety and protect lives through my engineering work, and my responsibility to guide my community in worship. The clock ticked, and I felt torn, anxiety rising as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
