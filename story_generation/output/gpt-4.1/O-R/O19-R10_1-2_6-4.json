New drugs, new protocols\u2014so much to keep up with, and I knew my patients depended on my knowledge. Just as I was making a mental note to research a new medication, I overheard voices from the hallway. My friend Priya, who also worked at the pharmacy, was being reprimanded by our supervisor for a mistake she didn\u2019t make. I could hear the frustration and injustice in her voice, and my heart twisted. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma\u2014for what is right\u2014even if it means facing discomfort. But I also felt the weight of my professional duty: to stay focused, to keep up with the relentless pace, to not get involved in workplace conflicts that could distract me from my responsibilities. My mind raced, torn between the urge to intervene for Priya and the pressure to stay updated and professional. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between what I should do and what I must do."}
