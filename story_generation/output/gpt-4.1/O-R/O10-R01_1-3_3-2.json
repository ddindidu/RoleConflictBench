The tax law seminar was scheduled for tomorrow morning\u2014an essential update for any accountant, especially with the looming changes that could affect every client I serve. Missing it could mean falling behind, risking mistakes, and failing the trust my clients place in me to keep them compliant and secure.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed. It was Sarah, her voice trembling. She needed to meet, urgently. She was facing a crisis, her choices heavy with moral weight, and she wanted my guidance\u2014not as her accountant, but as her pastor. She needed someone to listen, to help her find clarity and hope in the darkness.\n\nI felt the expectations pressing in from both sides. My profession demanded diligence and up-to-date knowledge; my calling as a pastor demanded compassion and presence. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My mind raced, torn between duty and devotion, between the rules of the world and the needs of the soul. I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
