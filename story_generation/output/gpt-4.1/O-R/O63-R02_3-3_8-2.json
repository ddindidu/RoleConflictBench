The automated compliance system was merciless\u2014one minute off schedule, and I\u2019d get flagged. My supervisor had already warned me twice this month. But today was different. Today was the most significant religious holiday of the year, and as the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers and rituals. The congregation would be waiting, some traveling hours just to attend. My phone buzzed with reminders from both worlds: a calendar alert for the service, a system notification for my next call. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands\u2014my job\u2019s rigid schedule against my spiritual duty to the community. I could feel the pressure mounting, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between logging out for the service and staying logged in to avoid disciplinary action."}
