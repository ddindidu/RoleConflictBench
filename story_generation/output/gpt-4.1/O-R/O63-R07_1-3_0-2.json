I straighten my headset, ready to greet the next customer with practiced warmth. Most days, the script is my shield\u2014every objection, every question, I have a line ready. Today, though, my mind drifts to the monastery. The annual festival starts at dawn, and I promised to help with the preparations. The community expects my presence, my hands folding lotus petals, my voice chanting with the others. But here I am, reciting product benefits, fielding questions I\u2019ve answered a hundred times. My supervisor expects me to stay until my shift ends, to keep my numbers up. The festival is sacred, a time for reflection and service, but the call queue is long, and my absence would be noticed. I feel the tension coil in my chest\u2014two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my full attention, each with its own quiet urgency. The next call beeps in, and I hesitate, caught between duty and devotion, unsure which voice to answer."}
