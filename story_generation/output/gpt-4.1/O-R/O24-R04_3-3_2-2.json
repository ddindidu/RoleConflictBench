As a judge, I was expected to review every detail, to weigh the evidence with care and impartiality, and to deliver a ruling that could change lives. My phone buzzed with a message from the mosque: the congregation had gathered for a special remembrance, and I was the only authorized imam present. The call to prayer would begin in minutes. My heart pounded as I stared at the legal documents, my mind torn between the urgent needs of justice and the spiritual responsibility to lead my community in prayer. Both roles demanded my full presence, both were matters of trust and duty. I felt the weight of expectation pressing in from all sides, my conscience wrestling with the knowledge that, no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
