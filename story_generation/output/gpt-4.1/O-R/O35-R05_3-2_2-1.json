The train was packed, and I was responsible for every soul on board. Suddenly, a red alert flashed: brake system malfunction. My training screamed at me\u2014stop the train, report immediately, ensure everyone\u2019s safety. My hand hovered over the radio, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a reminder: Shabbat service in one hour. As the rabbi, I was expected to deliver a message of hope and guidance, to be present for my congregation, especially today when so many needed comfort. My mind raced. If I stopped the train, I\u2019d be late, maybe miss the service entirely. But if I ignored the alert, I\u2019d be risking lives, betraying the trust placed in me as an operator. The weight of both uniforms pressed on my shoulders, each demanding my full devotion, each impossible to ignore. My heart pounded as I stared at the blinking alert, torn between two worlds, unable to move."}
