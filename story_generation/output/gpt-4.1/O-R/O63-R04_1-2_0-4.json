As a telemarketer, I was used to handling objections, answering questions, and following the script. Most days, the calls were routine\u2014people listened, sometimes asked about the product, and I responded with the lines I\u2019d practiced a hundred times. But today, my mind kept drifting to the mosque. I was the only imam scheduled for the Friday sermon, and the community had already announced my topic. I knew the congregation expected a thoughtful, inspiring khutbah, and I could picture the rows of faces waiting for me to speak. \n\nBut here I was, headset on, trying to focus on a customer\u2019s question about our latest offer. My supervisor expected me to meet my call quota, to stay on script, to close sales. Yet, every minute I spent on the phone was a minute less to prepare my sermon. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me\u2014my duty to my job, and my responsibility to my community. My heart pounded as I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between two worlds that demanded all of me at once."}
