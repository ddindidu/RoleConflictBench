I\u2019m counting out the day\u2019s final high-value transactions, my hands steady but my mind racing. Every bill, every coin, every receipt must be perfect\u2014one mistake, and the drawer won\u2019t balance, and I\u2019ll be held responsible. My phone vibrates in my pocket. I know what it is: a reminder for Daniel\u2019s bar mitzvah, the ceremony I\u2019ve promised to lead, the one his family has been planning for months. They\u2019re expecting me at the synagogue in less than an hour. My manager glances over, expecting me to finish the count and close out the register without error. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014my duty to my job, to accuracy and trust, and my duty to my community, to tradition and celebration. My heart pounds as I stare at the stack of bills, torn between the numbers in front of me and the sacred words I\u2019m meant to speak."}
