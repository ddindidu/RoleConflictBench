Next week\u2019s shutdown was my only window to service the machines\u2014cleaning, oiling, checking every belt and gear. If I missed it, the factory risked costly breakdowns, and I\u2019d be letting down the team that counted on me to keep things running smoothly. \n\nBut as I closed my toolbox, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the final Torah study session with Miriam, the conversion candidate. Her Beit Din appearance was set, and this last lesson was crucial. She was anxious, full of questions, and I was the one she trusted to guide her. The community expected me to be there, to teach, to support her spiritual journey.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. The machines needed me\u2014my hands, my focus. Miriam needed me\u2014my heart, my wisdom. I could hear the hum of the factory in my mind, the quiet anticipation of the study room. I stood in the hallway, torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me as the days ticked closer."}
