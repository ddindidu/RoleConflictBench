The emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just landed on my desk, the file thick and urgent. As a judge, I was expected to review every detail, analyze the facts, and make a ruling within the hour. The pressure was immense; someone\u2019s safety might depend on my decision. Yet, as I reached for the first page, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a colleague\u2014her mother was in the hospital, and she needed someone to cover her shift at the courthouse coffee stand, just for a few minutes. She sounded desperate, and I knew she often relied on small acts of kindness to get through her days. As a Christian, I felt the pull to help, to show love in action, just as I\u2019d been taught. But the weight of the case file in my hands reminded me of my duty to the law and to those seeking justice. My heart pounded as I stared at the file, torn between the urgent demands of my profession and the quiet call to kindness."}
