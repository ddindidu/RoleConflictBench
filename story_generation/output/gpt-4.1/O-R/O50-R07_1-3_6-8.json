It was a new client, her voice bright but uncertain, asking if I could walk her through the basics of the machine I\u2019d serviced earlier. I could hear the expectation in her tone\u2014she needed reassurance, guidance, and a bit of patience. As a repairer, I knew it was my responsibility to help her feel confident, to make sure she wouldn\u2019t damage the equipment or hurt herself. But my teacher\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cTomorrow, you will share the essence of the Dharma with the sangha. Prepare well.\u201d I had promised to summarize the teachings, and the weight of that promise pressed on me. The minutes I spent on the phone would be minutes lost from my study and reflection, yet to ignore the client felt like neglecting my duty. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my full presence, and I sat there, phone in hand, torn between the world\u2019s needs and the path of inner cultivation."}
