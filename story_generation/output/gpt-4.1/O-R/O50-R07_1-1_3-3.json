The machines would be silent, the perfect time to clean and tune every gear and belt. My supervisor expected nothing less than flawless performance\u2014no delays, no excuses. Yet, tucked in my pocket was a small slip of paper, a reminder from my sangha: \u201cTen minutes of quiet, every day.\u201d Next week, they planned a group meditation, a rare chance to sit together in stillness, just as the shutdown began. I could already hear the hum of expectation from both sides\u2014my supervisor\u2019s sharp eyes, my teacher\u2019s gentle encouragement. I felt the tension coil in my chest. Could I step away from the machines, even briefly, without letting someone down? The thought of missing the meditation left me uneasy, but so did the idea of neglecting my duties. I stood in the workshop, the scent of oil and metal mixing with the memory of incense, torn between the clamor of responsibility and the call to quiet."}
