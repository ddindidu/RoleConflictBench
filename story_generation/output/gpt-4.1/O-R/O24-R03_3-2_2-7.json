The emergency motion demanded my full attention; the law required swift, careful judgment, and I knew the parties involved were waiting anxiously for my ruling. Yet, my phone vibrated with a message from Sister Agnes: a parishioner was in distress, seeking guidance and comfort from me, her spiritual sister. My heart ached, torn between the duty to uphold justice and the call to offer solace and prayer. The expectation to be thorough and impartial as a judge clashed with the compassion and presence required of me as a nun. I stared at the legal briefs, feeling the weight of the law, while my rosary pressed against my palm, a silent reminder of my other calling. The minutes slipped away, and I wrestled with the impossible choice, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be leaving something vital behind."}
