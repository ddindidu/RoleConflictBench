My checklist for the pre-departure inspection lay on my lap, each item a reminder of my duty to keep hundreds of passengers safe and on time. The intercom crackled with updates from the control room, urging punctuality. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Maria: \u201cWe need all hands for the food drive. The shelter is counting on us.\u201d I could picture the convent kitchen, the bustle of my fellow sisters preparing meals, the grateful faces of those we served. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014one toward the steel tracks and the city\u2019s pulse, the other toward the warmth of the convent and the promise of comfort for the hungry. The clock ticked closer to departure, and I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to yield."}
