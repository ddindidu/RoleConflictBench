As a software developer, I knew how important it was to show up, to contribute ideas, to be seen as a team player. The session was technically optional, but everyone knew that the people who showed up were the ones who shaped the direction of the project. I wanted to be there, to have my voice heard, to help design something meaningful.\n\nBut just as I was about to log in, my phone buzzed. A message from the church secretary: someone was waiting in the sanctuary, desperate for guidance. As a priest, I was the one people turned to in moments of crisis. I could picture them now, sitting alone in the pew, hoping for comfort, for answers, for someone to listen. My heart ached at the thought of letting them down.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest. My team needed my ideas; this person needed my presence. I sat frozen at my desk, torn between the demands of my two worlds, unsure which call to answer first."}
