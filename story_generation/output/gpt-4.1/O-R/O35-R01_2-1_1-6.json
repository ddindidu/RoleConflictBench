The control panel glowed softly, reminding me of my duty: keep the train safe, keep it on time. A minor delay had just been announced\u2014nothing serious, but enough to require my full attention. I adjusted the speed, careful not to jolt the passengers. My mind, though, wandered back to the community gathering from last night. As a pastor, I\u2019d shared a story about honesty and faith, hoping to inspire. But someone had later approached me, questioning if I was imposing my beliefs too strongly. Now, as the train rumbled forward, I felt the weight of both roles. The city expected me to deliver them safely and punctually. My congregation looked to me for guidance and moral clarity. I gripped the controls tighter, feeling the tension between the world of steel tracks and the world of spirit. Could I truly serve both without failing one? The signal flickered green, but my thoughts remained tangled, caught between the demands of the rails and the pulpit."}
