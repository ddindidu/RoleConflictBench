Their voices were uncertain, and I realized they hadn\u2019t reviewed the safety protocols. As the machine repairer, it was my duty to guide them, to make sure no one got hurt. I could see the confusion in their eyes, the way they looked to me for reassurance. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was Miriam from the synagogue. Her father had passed away, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral\u2014immediately, if possible. As their rabbi, I was expected to be there, to offer comfort and lead the service. My heart twisted. The staff needed my expertise to prevent a possible disaster, but the grieving family needed my presence and compassion. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent, and I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of two worlds pressing in on me."}
