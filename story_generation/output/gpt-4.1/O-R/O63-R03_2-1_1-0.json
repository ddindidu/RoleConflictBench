My script only covers the basics, and I fumble for answers, trying to sound confident. My supervisor expects me to handle objections smoothly, to keep the call going, to make the sale. But my mind keeps drifting to the convent\u2019s kitchen, where the other sisters are packing food for the shelter. Today is the monthly drive, and I promised Sister Agnes I\u2019d help. The community counts on us, and I feel the weight of their expectation pressing on my heart. I glance at the clock, torn between the ringing phone and the memory of Sister Maria\u2019s gentle reminder: \u201cCharity is our calling.\u201d My hands tremble as I prepare for the next call, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me. I want to be present for both worlds, but the demands are pulling me apart. The phone rings again, and I hesitate, caught between duty and devotion, unsure which voice to answer first."}
