The contractor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cWe need to finish by Friday, or we lose the client.\u201d I glanced at the blueprints, mentally calculating how much work was left: hinges, shelves, the final polish. My phone buzzed with a message from the synagogue: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, the children\u2019s holiday lesson is tomorrow. They still need to learn the blessings for the festival.\u201d I pictured their eager faces, waiting for me to teach them the words my own father taught me. My chest tightened. The crew depended on me to keep the project moving, but my community and my faith expected me to guide the children, especially now, with the holiday so close. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of unfinished wood in one hand, the responsibility of tradition in the other, unsure how I could possibly meet both demands."}
