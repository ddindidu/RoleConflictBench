He mentioned he was in no rush, just heading to a casual meeting. As a taxi driver, I felt relief\u2014no pressure to speed, just a simple ride. But my mind kept drifting to the office function scheduled for this afternoon. It was a big event, and all my colleagues would be there, men and women mingling freely. \n\nAs a Muslim, I always tried to dress modestly, long sleeves and loose clothing, even in the summer heat. But I knew the office culture leaned toward more casual, even trendy attire. I could already imagine the curious glances, the subtle questions about my choice of dress. Part of me wanted to blend in, to avoid standing out, but another part of me felt the weight of my faith, the importance of holding onto my values. \n\nDriving through the city streets, I felt the tension building inside me, torn between the comfort of fitting in and the conviction of staying true to myself.
