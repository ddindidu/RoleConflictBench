The pain in his hands made every movement a struggle, and I knew he needed my help to eat. As a nursing assistant, it was my duty to make sure he was comfortable and nourished, no matter what. But as I glanced at the tray, my heart sank. The meal\u2014chicken in a creamy sauce, mashed potatoes, and a dessert\u2014had no kosher certification. At the communal event, the kitchen was bustling, and there was no way to substitute the food or prepare something else. \n\nI could feel the weight of my Jewish upbringing pressing on me, the expectation to keep kosher as my family always had. Yet, Mr. Harris looked at me with pleading eyes, hungry and in pain, relying on me for help. My hands hovered over the tray, torn between my commitment to my faith and my responsibility to care for him. The room felt smaller, the air heavier, as I wrestled with what I should do next."}
