The equipment hummed quietly, everything in perfect order. The checklist was due soon, and as a scientist, I knew the importance of following every protocol, even if nothing seemed amiss. My supervisor expected diligence\u2014no shortcuts, no assumptions. But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the new intern, Anna, who had been struggling lately. She\u2019d confided in me about her homesickness, and I\u2019d promised to have coffee with her after my shift. As a Christian, I felt a deep responsibility to show kindness, to be present for her, to live out the compassion I believed in. But the checklist would take time, and if I delayed it, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to the lab. If I skipped coffee, I\u2019d be turning away from someone in need. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, standing between the humming machines and the break room where Anna waited, uncertain which path to take."}
