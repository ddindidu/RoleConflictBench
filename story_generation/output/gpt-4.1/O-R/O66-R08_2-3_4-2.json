The city was restless tonight\u2014cars darted between lanes, brake lights flaring unpredictably. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to stay alert, hands steady on the wheel, eyes scanning for sudden stops. My passengers trusted me to get them home safely, and I couldn\u2019t let my guard down, not even for a moment.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the Quran verses I hadn\u2019t yet read. The study circle at the mosque was meeting tonight, and I was expected to recite and reflect on passages I barely remembered. My community valued thoughtful participation, and I didn\u2019t want to disappoint them or seem unprepared. Guilt gnawed at me\u2014should I pull over and read, risking my passengers\u2019 safety and my own job, or keep driving and arrive at the mosque unready, letting down my faith community? The rain kept falling, and I gripped the wheel tighter, torn between the road ahead and the words I longed to understand."}
