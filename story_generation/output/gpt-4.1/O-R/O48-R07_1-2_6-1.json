Mrs. Lee, frail and soft-spoken, looked up at me with hopeful eyes. \u201cWill you stay a little longer?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling. I knew she\u2019d been feeling lonely lately, and as a nursing assistant, I was expected to offer not just medical care but also companionship and comfort. I pulled up a chair, feeling the weight of her need for connection.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about the memorial service at the temple tonight. As a Buddhist, I was expected to join the community in honoring those who had passed, to chant and meditate with others. The ceremony was important, not just for me, but for the whole sangha. I could already imagine the gentle glow of candles, the sound of chanting, the sense of unity.\n\nSitting beside Mrs. Lee, I felt torn. My heart ached for her loneliness, yet my mind drifted to the temple, to my spiritual family waiting for me. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I sat there, caught between two worlds, unsure which path to follow."}
