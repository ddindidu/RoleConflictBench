I promised them we\u2019d practice tonight, that I\u2019d help them understand why we light the candles and sing the songs. But the clock is ticking, and every minute I spend away from the phone is a sale I might miss. My team is counting on me, and so are my kids. The guilt gnaws at me\u2014am I a good parent if I let work come first? Am I a good colleague if I walk away now? The demands of both worlds pull at me, and I sit frozen, headset in hand, torn between the ringing phone and the voices of my children waiting at home."}
