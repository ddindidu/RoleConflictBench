My train leaves in twenty minutes,\u201d he pleaded, his voice tight with worry. The station was clear across town, and traffic was already thickening. As a taxi driver, I felt the pressure to get him there safely and on time\u2014my reputation depended on it. But as I gripped the steering wheel, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the main weekly service at the church would begin in half an hour. As the priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, to be present for my community, especially today when so many would gather. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my passenger and the responsibility to my congregation. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my best. My heart pounded as I approached the intersection where I\u2019d have to choose which road to take."}
