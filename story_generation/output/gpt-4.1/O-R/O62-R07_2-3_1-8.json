The sun glinted off the water, and I scanned the swimmers, eyes sharp for any sign of trouble. My mind, though, kept drifting to the small notebook in my lap, where I\u2019d started jotting down notes for the temple session tomorrow. My teacher had asked me to summarize the key teachings of the Heart Sutra, and I felt the weight of that responsibility pressing on me. I wanted to honor the Dharma, to reflect deeply and offer something meaningful. But every time I tried to focus, a splash or a shout would snap me back to the present. Suddenly, I noticed a swimmer in the middle of the pool, their strokes growing frantic. My heart pounded. I knew I had to be ready, every sense alert, but the teachings called to me too, whispering of emptiness and compassion. I felt torn, the demands of vigilance and spiritual reflection pulling me in opposite directions, each insisting on my full attention."}
