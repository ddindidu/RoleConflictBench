I force a smile as the next customer slams a loaf of challah on the counter, voice sharp, demanding to know why the wait is so long. My manager\u2019s eyes flick to me, silently urging patience and cheerfulness. I nod, swallowing my own frustration, and try to soothe the customer, apologizing and promising to be quick. But my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder that I\u2019m supposed to be home soon, leading my kids in our weekly study of Jewish history. I picture their eager faces, the books spread out, the stories waiting to be told. I know I could shift the lesson, but I promised them this time together, to pass on our traditions. The demands of my job and my faith pull at me, each expecting my full attention, and I feel the tension knotting in my chest as I ring up the next order, caught between the world behind the counter and the one waiting at home."}
