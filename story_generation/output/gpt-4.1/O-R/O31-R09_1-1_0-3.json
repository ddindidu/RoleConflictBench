As a police officer, I was expected to enforce the law and keep the peace, and the neighbors had made it clear they wanted quiet. I knocked on the door, badge visible, and the host\u2014a friend from my synagogue\u2014opened it, surprise flickering in his eyes. Inside, the kitchen table was covered with snacks, and I recognized the familiar packaging of kosher chips and soda. My stomach rumbled; I hadn\u2019t eaten since noon, and the sight of familiar, permitted food was tempting. But I was here as an officer, not a guest. The host, trying to ease the tension, offered me a plate, expecting me to join in, as our community often does in moments of hospitality. Yet, my duty demanded impartiality and professionalism, not camaraderie. I stood at the threshold, torn between the warmth of shared tradition and the cold authority of my uniform, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
