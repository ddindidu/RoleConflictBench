The roads were clear, the sky deceptively calm after last night\u2019s hurricane. As a taxi driver, I was expected to obey every traffic law, to drive safely and never take risks. But my phone buzzed again with another urgent message from the mayor\u2014my other life, as Sister Maria, was calling. The community center was overwhelmed, and they needed me to help coordinate food and shelter for the families who\u2019d lost everything. I could picture the faces of the children, the elderly, all waiting for help. My heart ached to be there, to serve as I\u2019d vowed. But I was still on shift, and my next passenger was waiting. If I sped or cut corners, I\u2019d be breaking the rules I\u2019d promised to uphold as a driver. If I didn\u2019t hurry, I\u2019d be failing my calling as a nun. The light turned green, and I sat for a moment, torn between the demands of the road and the cries for help echoing in my soul."}
