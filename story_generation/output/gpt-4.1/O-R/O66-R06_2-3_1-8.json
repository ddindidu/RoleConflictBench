My passenger, a young woman clutching a suitcase, slid into the back seat, her voice trembling. \u201cPlease, my train leaves in twenty minutes. Can you get me to the station?\u201d I nodded, feeling the familiar pressure of the clock. As I merged into traffic, she began to cry softly, her hands shaking. Between sobs, she told me her mother was in the hospital, and this train was her only chance to say goodbye. My heart ached for her. As a Christian, I knew I should offer comfort, maybe even a prayer, but the traffic was thick and the minutes were slipping away. If I slowed down to talk, she might miss her train. If I focused only on driving fast, I\u2019d ignore her pain. The city\u2019s demands and my faith\u2019s call to compassion pulled me in opposite directions, and I gripped the wheel, torn between getting her there on time and being the comfort she so desperately needed."}
