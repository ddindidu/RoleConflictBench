As a cashier, I prided myself on being efficient and accurate, making sure every item scanned correctly and every customer left satisfied. The line was short, and I was almost done with my shift when an elderly woman approached, her hands trembling as she placed a few basic groceries on the belt. She fumbled with her wallet, her face flushed with embarrassment as she realized she was short on cash. The people behind her began to sigh and shift impatiently. \n\nAs a Christian, I felt a deep urge to show her kindness, to help her in her moment of need, just as Jesus would have wanted. But as a cashier, I was expected to follow store policy\u2014no giving away items, no exceptions. My manager watched from a distance, and I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My heart ached for the woman, but my mind raced with the rules I was supposed to uphold. I stood there, torn, the expectations of my job and my faith pulling me in opposite directions."}
