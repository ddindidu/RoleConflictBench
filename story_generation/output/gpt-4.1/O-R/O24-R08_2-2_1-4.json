As a judge, I knew I had to review every detail, every argument, to ensure a fair hearing. The weight of responsibility pressed on me; justice demanded my full attention. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the office function was this afternoon. It was a casual event, but I knew from past experience that my colleagues would dress informally, and the atmosphere would be relaxed. \n\nAs a Muslim, I was expected to dress modestly, covering my arms and legs, and wearing a loose scarf. I could already imagine the curious glances, the subtle questions, the feeling of being set apart. I wanted to be approachable, to fit in with my peers, but I also wanted to honor my faith. The clock ticked on, and I felt the tension rising\u2014torn between the demands of my profession and the expectations of my beliefs, unsure how to reconcile them as the afternoon approached."}
