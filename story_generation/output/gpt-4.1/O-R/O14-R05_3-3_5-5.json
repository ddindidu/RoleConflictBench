The journal\u2019s submission portal blinked a warning: only a few hours left to upload my finalized report and datasets. As a scientist, I knew the importance of accuracy and timeliness\u2014my team was counting on me to represent our findings with integrity. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the conversion candidate\u2019s final study session was about to begin. As their rabbi, I was their guide, their reassurance before the Beit Din, and this session could shape their entire Jewish journey. My mind raced with the weight of both responsibilities. I imagined the disappointment of my colleagues if I missed the deadline, the potential setback for our research. At the same time, I pictured the candidate\u2019s anxious face, relying on me for support and wisdom. The clock ticked louder, and I felt the tension coil in my chest, torn between the demands of science and the sacred duty of teaching Torah."}
