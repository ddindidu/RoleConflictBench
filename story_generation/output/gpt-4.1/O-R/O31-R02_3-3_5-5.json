Bystanders at risk.\u201d My hand instinctively reached for my badge and sidearm. Duty surged in my veins\u2014protect, intervene, save lives. But just then, the heavy oak door creaked open. A young woman stumbled in, eyes red, hands trembling. \u201cFather, please, I need you. I can\u2019t do this anymore,\u201d she whispered, voice breaking. Her pain was raw, desperate, and I saw in her the fragile hope that someone might listen, might care. My heart pounded. As a police officer, I was sworn to act, to run toward danger and shield the innocent. As a priest, I was called to offer comfort, to be present for the broken and lost. Both roles demanded everything of me, right now, in opposite directions. I stood frozen, torn between the siren\u2019s call of duty and the silent plea for grace, feeling the weight of two worlds pressing in, waiting for me to choose."}
