As a lawyer, I was reviewing confidential files when an assistant, new to the firm, knocked and asked for access to a client\u2019s documents. She explained it would help her organize the office, but I knew the rules\u2014client confidentiality was absolute. I could see her frustration when I hesitated, her expectation that I\u2019d make her job easier.\n\nLater that afternoon, as a pastor, I met with a church member who was struggling with a family crisis. She needed guidance, someone to listen and offer hope. She looked at me with trust, expecting compassion and support, not the guarded reserve I wore in the office.\n\nThe demands of both roles clashed within me. As a lawyer, I was trained to protect secrets, to be cautious and precise. As a pastor, I was called to be open, empathetic, and available. I felt torn, wondering how I could honor both callings without betraying the expectations of either. The tension gnawed at me, and I found myself wrestling with what to do next."}
