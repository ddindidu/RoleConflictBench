My team expects me to lead the experiment, to gather the data that could validate months of hypotheses. I feel the weight of their trust, the pressure to deliver results, and the excitement of discovery. Just as I\u2019m preparing, my phone buzzes\u2014a message from my Buddhist friend. They want to meet and discuss a recent sermon, seeking my insight and presence. I know the importance of spiritual study, of being there for a friend on their path, and I feel the gentle tug of my Buddhist commitments. My mind is split: the sterile, focused world of the lab on one side, the quiet, compassionate space of spiritual reflection on the other. Both demand my full attention, both are urgent in their own way. I stand in the hallway, heart pounding, torn between the pursuit of knowledge and the call to mindful presence, uncertain which path to follow."}
