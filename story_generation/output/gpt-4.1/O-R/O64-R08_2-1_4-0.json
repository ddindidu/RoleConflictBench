She looked tired, hopeful, and explained she\u2019d lost her receipt but needed to return it. My training as a cashier was clear: no returns without proof of purchase. The policy was strict, and my manager had reminded us just last week\u2014no exceptions. I could see the disappointment in her eyes as I explained the rule, her voice trembling as she pleaded for understanding.\n\nAs she spoke, my mind drifted to the evening ahead. I had planned a quiet night, just me and the Quran, a rare chance to recite and reflect without interruption. It was something I\u2019d been looking forward to all week, a spiritual need that felt as urgent as any physical hunger. But now, standing here, I felt torn. The store demanded I enforce the rules, but my faith urged me toward compassion and understanding. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I could feel my resolve wavering as I looked from the customer to the return policy taped to the counter."}
