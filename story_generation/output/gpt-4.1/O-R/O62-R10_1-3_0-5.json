My job was clear: watch every swimmer, never let my attention waver. A few kids drifted toward the deep end, but they seemed safe for now. Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the pool manager slipping cash into his pocket after a heated exchange with a vendor. I recognized the vendor\u2014he\u2019d been complaining about unfair treatment for weeks. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act against injustice and corruption. But if I left my post to confront the manager, even for a moment, I\u2019d be abandoning my duty to protect the swimmers. The rules were strict: never leave the chair unattended. My mind raced, torn between the ethical call to act and the professional demand to stay vigilant. I gripped the armrests, feeling the tension coil inside me, unsure which duty I could bear to betray."}
