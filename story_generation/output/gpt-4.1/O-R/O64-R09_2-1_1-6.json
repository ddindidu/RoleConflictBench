My manager\u2019s eyes flick to the clock, reminding me that accuracy is just as important as speed. I know every mistake means more time fixing it, more frustration for the customers, and a reprimand for me. But as I hand change to a customer, my phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a reminder for tonight\u2019s synagogue service. I promised my family I\u2019d be there, and I know how much it means to them, even if the minyan would be fine without me. My shift isn\u2019t over for another hour, and the line doesn\u2019t seem to be getting any shorter. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be a reliable cashier, and the pull of my faith and community. My heart pounds as I glance at the clock, torn between staying at my post and slipping away to honor my commitment at synagogue."}
