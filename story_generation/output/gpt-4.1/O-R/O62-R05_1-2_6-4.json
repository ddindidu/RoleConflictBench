I know the rules\u2014no one in the water without a lifeguard watching, especially not the little ones. But today, the clock ticks closer to four, and my phone buzzes with a reminder: the children are gathering in the synagogue classroom, waiting for me to teach them Torah, to guide them in the ways of our faith. I feel the weight of both uniforms\u2014the red lifeguard shirt clinging to my back, the rabbinic kippah tucked in my bag. Parents expect me to keep their children safe here, but they also trust me to nurture their souls, to be present and wise in the classroom. My heart pounds as I watch the swimmers, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once. The pool rules are clear, but so is my commitment to my students. I stand at the edge, torn, the sounds of laughter and splashing mixing with the imagined voices of children waiting for their rabbi."}
