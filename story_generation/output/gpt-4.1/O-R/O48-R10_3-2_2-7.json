My shift as a nursing assistant was almost over, and my family was waiting for me at home to begin the puja for a special Hindu festival. I had promised to be there on time, dressed in my clean kurta, to help with the prayers and rituals. But as I moved through the ward, I saw Mr. Patel, one of my patients, grimacing in pain, struggling to lift his spoon. He looked at me with pleading eyes, and I knew he needed help eating his dinner. My supervisor expected me to make sure every patient was comfortable before I left, and I couldn\u2019t ignore someone in pain. Yet, my family was counting on me, and missing the ceremony would disappoint them deeply. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing down on me, unsure which duty I should honor first."}
