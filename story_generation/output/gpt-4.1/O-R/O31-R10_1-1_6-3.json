The driver, an elderly man, was inside, eyes closed in prayer. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness\u2014rules were rules, and issuing a ticket was my duty. Yet, as a Hindu, I was taught to act with compassion and uphold dharma, the moral path. I remembered the teachings about kindness and understanding, especially toward elders and those engaged in worship. My hand hovered over my ticket pad, heart pounding. Was it fair to penalize someone for a minor infraction while they sought spiritual solace? But if I let him go, was I being unfair to others who had received tickets? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different. I stood there, torn, wrestling with the expectations of my badge and my beliefs, unsure which path to choose."}
