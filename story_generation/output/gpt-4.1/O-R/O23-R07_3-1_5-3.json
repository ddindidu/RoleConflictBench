My client\u2019s future, and a substantial sum of money, hang in the balance. The judge has made it clear: no delays, no excuses. My phone vibrates with a gentle reminder\u2014my daily ten-minute meditation, a practice I\u2019ve never missed in years. As a Buddhist, I am expected to honor this window of stillness, to cultivate mindfulness and compassion, especially in moments of stress. But the courtroom is no place for silence or retreat; my client expects unwavering focus, sharp arguments, and total presence. My heart pounds as I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The lawyer in me demands action, strategy, and control. The Buddhist in me pleads for pause, breath, and acceptance. I close my eyes for a moment, caught between the urgent call to serve justice and the quiet pull toward inner peace, uncertain which voice I will heed."}
