As a carpenter, I know the importance of a clean, organized space\u2014one careless moment, and someone could get hurt. My supervisor expects nothing less; safety is the rule here, and I take pride in meeting it. But as I wipe sweat from my brow, my thoughts drift to Mecca. My parents call every week, gently reminding me of my duty as a Muslim to perform Hajj. I feel the weight of their hopes, the longing in their voices. Yet, my pay barely covers rent and groceries, let alone the cost of pilgrimage. I want to honor my faith, to fulfill this pillar of Islam, but I also need to prove myself at work, to keep this job and stay safe. The pressure builds inside me\u2014am I neglecting my faith for my career, or am I being responsible by waiting? My heart aches with the pull of both worlds, and I stand in the middle of my tidy workshop, unsure which path to take."}
