My mind was already drifting to the church hall, where the committee would soon gather for the first planning meeting of our adult faith formation series. I was supposed to lead, to inspire, to be present. But here, in the fluorescent-lit store, I noticed a small discrepancy in the register\u2014just a few dollars off, nothing that would change the day\u2019s total, but enough to catch my eye. Store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, every irregularity reported. My manager expected diligence, honesty, and attention to detail. Yet, if I stayed to sort it out, I\u2019d be late for the meeting, letting down the parishioners who looked to me for guidance and organization. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: the store\u2019s demand for precision and accountability, the church\u2019s need for my leadership and presence. I felt pulled in two directions, each role demanding my full attention, each with its own set of values and responsibilities. I stared at the register, torn, the clock ticking toward the meeting\u2019s start."}
