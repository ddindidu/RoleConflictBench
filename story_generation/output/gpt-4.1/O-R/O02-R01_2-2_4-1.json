The new safety standard had just been released, and I was responsible for ensuring every detail of our design met the updated regulations. My team depended on me to catch any oversight\u2014lives could be at stake, and the company\u2019s reputation was on the line. As I reviewed the compliance checklist, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was waiting in my office, desperate for guidance about a life-altering decision. I knew she needed my full attention, my empathy, and my prayers. But the evidence of conformity for the project was due by the end of the day, and any delay could jeopardize everything we\u2019d worked for. My mind raced, torn between the weight of technical responsibility and the call to offer spiritual support. Both roles demanded my presence, my care, and my integrity. I felt the pressure mounting, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which need was greater or how I could possibly meet them both."}
