I tried to soothe her, offering to fix the layers, but my mind kept drifting to the church hall across the street. The children would be gathering soon, waiting for me to lead their weekly religious class. As a priest, I was expected to be there on time, to guide and inspire them, but as a hairdresser, I couldn\u2019t abandon a client in distress. My hands trembled as I held the scissors, torn between the duty to calm Mrs. Evans and the responsibility to my parish. The salon\u2019s fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, echoing the tension inside me. I could picture the children\u2019s expectant faces, the parents\u2019 trust in my guidance, and at the same time, I felt the weight of Mrs. Evans\u2019s disappointment. Both roles demanded my full presence, but I could only be in one place. My heart pounded as I stood between the mirror and the door, caught in the impossible pull of two worlds."}
