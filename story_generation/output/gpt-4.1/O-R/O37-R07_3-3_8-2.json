Today was the monastery\u2019s annual festival, a day I cherished as a Buddhist. The community would gather, chanting and preparing offerings, and I was expected to help with the rituals, to be present in body and spirit. But as the housekeeping cleaner, I was also responsible for sanitizing the main hall before the crowds arrived. The rules were clear: gloves, mask, and sanitizer for every surface, no exceptions. My supervisor had reminded me yesterday\u2014no shortcuts, especially with so many people coming.\n\nAs I wheeled my cart past the incense smoke and the sound of morning bells, I saw the monks already arranging flowers and food. They called to me, asking for help with the altar. My heart ached to join them, to fulfill my spiritual duty. But my hands were gloved, my face masked, and I could not touch the sacred objects without breaking hygiene protocol. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with its own rules. I stood in the hallway, torn between the safety I was sworn to uphold and the spiritual community I longed to serve."}
