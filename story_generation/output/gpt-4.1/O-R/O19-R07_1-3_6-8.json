My phone buzzed with a new pharmacy newsletter\u2014another reminder to keep up with the latest medications and treatment guidelines. I scrolled through the updates, trying to absorb the essentials about a new anticoagulant, but my mind kept drifting. My Buddhist teacher had asked me to summarize key teachings for tomorrow\u2019s temple session, a responsibility I cherished. I should be reading the sutras, reflecting on impermanence and compassion, but instead, I was parsing clinical trial data and side effect profiles. The expectation to be a competent, up-to-date pharmacist pressed on me, but so did the call to deepen my spiritual understanding and serve my sangha.

The clock ticked down my break, and I stared at my phone, paralyzed between two worlds, unsure which path to follow in this moment."}
