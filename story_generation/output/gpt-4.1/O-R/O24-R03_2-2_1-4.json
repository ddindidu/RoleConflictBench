As a judge, I knew the importance of being prepared\u2014every detail could tip the scales of justice. My mind raced through legal arguments, precedents, and the weight of responsibility I carried for those awaiting my decision. Just as I began to make notes, the chapel bell rang, signaling the start of a special healing service for Sister Agnes, who had fallen gravely ill. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to pray and offer comfort, especially during moments like this. My heart ached with the pull of duty; the community needed my presence, my prayers, my faith. Yet the case files on my desk seemed to grow heavier, reminding me of the people depending on my careful judgment. I closed my eyes, torn between the silent call of justice and the gentle summons of compassion, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
