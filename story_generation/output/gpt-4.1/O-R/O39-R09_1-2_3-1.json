My boots crunched over dust and debris, and I grabbed the broom, knowing the expectation: leave the site spotless, safe for the next crew. But as I swept, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014just two days until the holiday. My kids were waiting at home, their eyes bright with questions about the blessings and stories I\u2019d promised to teach them. I pictured their faces, eager to learn, and felt the weight of my responsibility as a Jewish parent. The site was still a mess, and the foreman\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts. Safety first.\u201d But the thought of my children missing out on our traditions gnawed at me. I glanced at the clock, broom in hand, torn between the duty to my job and the duty to my family and faith. My heart pounded as I stood in the middle of the half-swept floor, wrestling with which role I could afford to let down."}
