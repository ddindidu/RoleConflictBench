The scent of bleach clung to my hands, and I could hear the faint hum of the washing machine in the background. As a housekeeping cleaner, it was my job to make sure nothing ran out, that every room was spotless and every supply was in its place. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized it was almost time for my daily puja. As a Hindu, I was expected to pause, light the lamp, and offer prayers at my home altar\u2014an act that brought me peace and connected me to my faith.\n\nBut the mop bucket was still half full, and the guest bathroom needed fresh towels. If I stopped now, I\u2019d fall behind on my cleaning schedule, and my supervisor would surely notice. Yet, if I delayed my prayers, I\u2019d feel a deep sense of guilt and disconnection from my spiritual duties. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood in the hallway, torn between the demands of my job and the call of my faith, unsure which to answer first."}
