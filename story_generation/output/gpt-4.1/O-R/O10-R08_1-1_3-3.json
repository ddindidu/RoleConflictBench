I had planned to wear my comfortable, loose pajamas and a simple headscarf, just enough to feel at ease around my parents and siblings. As I was making breakfast, an email popped up from my manager: a last-minute online seminar on upcoming tax law changes was being held today, and attendance was strongly encouraged for all accountants. I knew how important it was to stay updated and compliant, especially with the ever-shifting regulations. But the seminar required us to have our cameras on for group discussions, and I realized my home attire, while modest for family, didn\u2019t meet the professional standards I usually uphold in public or mixed company. I felt a knot in my stomach\u2014should I rush to change into more formal, modest clothing, disrupting the comfort of my day at home, or risk appearing unprofessional or not fully observing my religious guidelines? The pressure from both sides weighed on me as I stared at the clock, the seminar start time drawing closer."}
