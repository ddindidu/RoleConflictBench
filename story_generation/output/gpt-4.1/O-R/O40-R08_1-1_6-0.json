She looked desperate, explaining how much the toy meant to her son. As a carpenter, I knew I should examine the damage, estimate the cost, and reassure them I could fix it. The boy\u2019s hopeful eyes made it hard to say no. But tonight, I had promised myself something different. With no other commitments, I had planned to spend the evening reciting and reflecting on the Quran, something I\u2019d been neglecting for weeks. The peace I felt at the thought of reconnecting with my faith was suddenly clouded by the responsibility in front of me. My hands itched to get to work, but my heart longed for spiritual nourishment. I stood there, torn, the weight of both roles pressing in on me, unsure which expectation I should fulfill."}
