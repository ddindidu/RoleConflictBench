My train leaves in fifteen minutes,\u201d he pleaded, his voice tight with worry. As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get him to the station safely and on time, but traffic was thick and the city lights blurred in the rain. My phone buzzed on the seat beside me\u2014a message from the church secretary: \u201cFather, someone is here in crisis. She\u2019s crying and asking for you. Please come quickly.\u201d My heart twisted. As a priest, I was expected to offer comfort and guidance, to be present for those in pain. But right now, I was behind the wheel, responsible for this man\u2019s urgent journey. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to put their need first. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I wrestled with the impossible choice, torn between the road ahead and the soul in need behind church doors."}
