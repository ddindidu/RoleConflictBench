The hospital\u2019s address blinked on my delivery app, a red warning flashing: \u201cUrgent\u2014medical supplies for patient care.\u201d I knew the importance of getting these packages there on time; someone\u2019s health depended on it. But as I turned onto the main road, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the call to prayer was in fifteen minutes. I was the imam, expected to lead the small congregation at the mosque. Even though Brother Ahmed could step in, I knew the community looked to me for guidance and consistency. My mind raced with the weight of both roles\u2014one demanding punctuality for a stranger\u2019s well-being, the other expecting my presence for spiritual leadership. The hospital was still ten minutes away, and the mosque was in the opposite direction. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the expectations pulling me apart, the city lights blurring as I tried to decide which responsibility I could bear to let down."}
