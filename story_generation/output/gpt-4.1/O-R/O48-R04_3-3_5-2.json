As a nursing assistant, I knew I had to stay close, checking her vitals every few minutes, ready to alert the nurse if anything changed. The weight of responsibility pressed on me; her life could depend on my vigilance. My phone buzzed in my pocket. A message from the mosque committee: the congregation was waiting, the special remembrance about to begin, and no one else could lead the prayer. As the imam, I was expected to guide them, especially on such an important occasion. I looked at the patient, then at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. My heart pounded with anxiety. If I left, I\u2019d be abandoning my duty here; if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my community. Both roles demanded my presence, both were urgent, and I felt torn in two, paralyzed by the impossible choice before me."}
