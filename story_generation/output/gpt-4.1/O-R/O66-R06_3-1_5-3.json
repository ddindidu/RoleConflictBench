The construction cones forced all the cars into a single file, and just beyond the orange barriers, a cluster of children waited at the curb, backpacks swinging. As a taxi driver, I knew the rules\u2014slow down, be vigilant, protect every life. My foot hovered over the brake, heart pounding with the weight of responsibility. But as I inched forward, my phone buzzed with a reminder: Sunday worship at church. I hadn\u2019t attended in weeks, always caught up in the demands of my job. Guilt gnawed at me. My faith called me to gather with others, to worship and serve, but my shift often overlapped with service times. Now, as I navigated the chaos of the school zone, I felt torn\u2014between the duty to my passengers and the children outside, and the longing to fulfill my spiritual commitments. The pressure mounted, and I wondered which expectation I would have to let down this time."}
