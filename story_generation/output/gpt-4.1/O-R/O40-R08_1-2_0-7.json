As a carpenter, I know the importance of being on time\u2014my foreman is strict, and any delay means rushing, which could lead to mistakes or even accidents. Safety is everything, and I can\u2019t afford to let my guard down, not with the heavy machinery and sharp tools we use every day.\n\nBut this year, my heart is pulled in another direction. My friends are preparing for Hajj, and I\u2019ve finally saved enough to join them. The thought of standing in Mecca, fulfilling a pillar of my faith, fills me with longing. Yet, the pilgrimage means taking time off work, leaving my team short-handed during our busiest season. My boss expects commitment, and my family relies on my steady income.\n\nI sit at the edge of my bed, torn between the duty to my craft and the call of my faith. The weight of both expectations presses on my chest, and I wonder how I can honor both without letting someone down."}
