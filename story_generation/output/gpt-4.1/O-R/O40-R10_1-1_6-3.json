She looked worried, and the boy clutched the pieces tightly. I promised to take a look and give her a fair quote. As I examined the toy, I noticed another customer quietly slip ahead of her in the queue, eager to get my attention. He insisted his job was urgent and tried to hand me cash under the table to bump him up the list. \n\nAs a carpenter, I know my job is to serve customers honestly and repair what\u2019s broken, giving each person their turn. But as a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to act with integrity and fairness, to stand up for what\u2019s right even in small matters. My heart pounded as I glanced at the mother and her son, waiting patiently, and then at the man, who looked at me expectantly. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure how to balance my duty to my craft and my moral principles."}
