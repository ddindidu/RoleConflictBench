The supervisor\u2019s sudden entrance made my heart race\u2014clipboard in hand, eyes sharp, ready to scrutinize every move. I knew the rules: no distractions, perfect timing, absolute focus. My job, my livelihood, depended on this audit. Yet, my phone vibrated in my pocket, a reminder of the sacred duty awaiting me above ground. Today was the holiest day of the year, the one service my congregation counted on me to lead. They expected my presence, my words, my guidance. I could almost hear the hymns, feel the weight of their hopes. But here, underground, the city demanded something else: precision, discipline, unwavering attention. My mind spun between the two worlds\u2014one of steel and schedules, the other of faith and community. The supervisor\u2019s pen hovered, ready to judge. My congregation waited, trusting I would not let them down. I gripped the controls tighter, torn by the impossible pull of both callings, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
