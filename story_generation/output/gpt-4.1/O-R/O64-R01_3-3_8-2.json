I force a smile as the next customer, red-faced and loud, slams a dented can on the counter, demanding a discount. My manager\u2019s eyes flicker over, reminding me to stay calm and friendly. I nod, swallowing my frustration, and try to soothe the customer, even as my heart pounds. My phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a text from Sarah, a member of my congregation. \u201cCan you talk? It\u2019s urgent. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d I know her crisis is serious; she\u2019s been struggling, and she trusts me to guide her. But I\u2019m trapped behind the register, expected to be patient and cheerful, while inside, I ache to step away and offer the comfort and wisdom she needs. The demands of both worlds press in on me, and I feel torn, my hands scanning groceries while my mind wrestles with the weight of someone\u2019s soul."}
