I had made sure my clothes were modest and clean, as is expected of me as a Muslim, especially on this day. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a new client, calling for a quick check-in. He sounded friendly, but a little lost, asking for some basic tips on operating the machine I\u2019d installed last week. As a machine repairer, I\u2019m expected to be helpful and available, especially for new clients who rely on my guidance. But standing there, shoes off, about to join the congregation, I felt torn. If I answered, I\u2019d have to step outside, possibly missing the opening of the prayer. If I ignored the call, I\u2019d risk disappointing a client and maybe even my reputation. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, caught between the demands of my faith and my responsibility to my work."}
