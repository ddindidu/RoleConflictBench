The lines on the paper were simple, focused on function\u2014just enough to make the space usable for my work. I was deep in thought, considering how to maximize the light from the single window, when my phone buzzed. A message from the mosque committee: \u201cThe backup imam is away. Can you lead the prayer today? Everyone is expecting you.\u201d\n\nI glanced at the clock. The prayer was in less than an hour, and I was nowhere near finished with the layout. My mind raced. As an architect, I felt the pressure to deliver a thoughtful design, even for my own space. But as an imam, I knew the congregation relied on me for spiritual guidance, especially when others were unavailable. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding my creative focus, the other my presence and leadership. I stared at my unfinished sketch, heart pounding, torn between the quiet demands of my craft and the urgent call of my community."}
