The app pinged again\u2014my passenger, impatient, sent another message: \u201cPlease hurry, I really need to get there on time.\u201d As a taxi driver, I knew my duty was to provide reliable, timely service. My rating depended on it, and so did my income. But my phone buzzed with another notification, this one from Sister Maria: \u201cPlease come, the healing service is starting soon. Sister Agnes needs all our prayers.\u201d The service was unscheduled, called for the sake of a beloved, ailing member of our community. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and faith, especially in moments like this. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds\u2014one demanding my presence behind the wheel, the other at the altar. I stared at the intersection ahead, torn between the urgent needs of a stranger and the sacred call of my sisters, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
