For weeks, I\u2019ve tracked the weather, waiting for this rare atmospheric alignment. If I miss this window, my research\u2014years of work\u2014might not survive the next funding review. My team is counting on me to run the experiment tonight. But as I check my phone, a reminder pops up: the weekly study session with the children at the synagogue. I promised to teach them about Shavuot, to share stories and traditions, to be present as a role model. The lesson could be moved, but I know how much the kids look forward to our time together, how important it is to nurture their connection to our heritage. My mind races, torn between the demands of my scientific career and my responsibility to my community. The weight of expectation presses on me from both sides, and I feel the tension in my chest as I stand in the lab, uncertain which path to choose."}
