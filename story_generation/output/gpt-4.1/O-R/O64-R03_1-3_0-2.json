My manager expects me to keep the line moving, to count change with precision, to smile and thank each customer. I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of my habit beneath my uniform. Just this morning, the mayor called the convent, his voice urgent\u2014hundreds are without shelter after the hurricane, and he needs me to help organize food and blankets at the community center. My sisters are already there, sorting donations and comforting families. But here I am, behind the counter, my hands moving automatically, my mind torn. The customers expect efficiency, my manager expects reliability, but my heart aches to be with those in need. I feel the pressure mounting, the demands of duty and compassion pulling me in opposite directions, and I wonder how I can possibly choose."}
