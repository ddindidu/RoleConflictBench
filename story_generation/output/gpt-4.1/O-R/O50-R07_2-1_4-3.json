The machines in the corner are humming louder than usual, their metal casings radiating heat. I know they missed their last service window, and now they\u2019re running hotter than they should. My supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime. Keep everything running smoothly.\u201d I reach for my toolbox, but then my phone vibrates with a gentle reminder: it\u2019s time for my daily ten-minute meditation. I promised myself I\u2019d never skip it, that I\u2019d always make space for mindfulness, no matter how busy things got. The expectation to be present, to breathe, to let go of stress, is just as strong as the demand to keep these machines from breaking down. My hands hover between the toolbox and the meditation cushion I keep tucked under my desk. The machines need me now, but so does my mind. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the impossible choice, torn between the urgent clamor of the machines and the quiet promise I made to myself."}
