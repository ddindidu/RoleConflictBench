As the company\u2019s accountant, I\u2019m responsible for ensuring every figure is accurate, every document compliant with the law. My manager expects nothing less than perfection, and I know a single mistake could cost us dearly. Yet, my heart is elsewhere. My doctor\u2019s words echo in my mind: if I want to perform Hajj, it must be this year\u2014my health may not allow it again. The pilgrimage is a pillar of my faith, a lifelong dream, and my family is urging me to seize this chance. But the dates overlap with the tax filing. If I leave, the company could face penalties; if I stay, I might lose my only chance to fulfill a sacred duty. The weight of both worlds presses on me, and I sit at my desk, torn between the demands of my profession and the call of my faith, unable to see a way forward."}
