Mrs. Evans sat across from me, her pill bottles lined up like soldiers. As her pharmacist, I needed to carefully review her medications\u2014blood thinners, heart pills, a new antidepressant. She trusted me to catch any dangerous interactions, to explain side effects, to keep her safe. But as I listened, I noticed her hands trembling, her eyes red-rimmed. The pastor in me recognized the silent plea for comfort, the pain she carried that no prescription could touch. I wanted to reach out, to offer a prayer or a gentle word about hope, but I worried about crossing boundaries in this sterile consultation room. My pharmacy training demanded focus on the clinical, the measurable. My pastoral heart ached to address the spiritual ache beneath her medical chart. I felt torn, the expectations of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each necessary, yet somehow at odds in this moment."}
