My muscles ache, but I\u2019m used to that. What I\u2019m not used to is the tug in my chest as I check my watch\u2014just two hours until the weekly study session with the kids at the community center. I promised their parents I\u2019d teach them about Shabbat, about the stories and values that shaped us. They look forward to it, and so do I. But the lesson could be moved; it\u2019s not set in stone. Still, I know how much it means to them, and to me, to keep that commitment. I feel the weight of the materials and the weight of my promise, both pressing down on me. I stand there, torn, the sun dipping lower, wondering how I can be in two places at once, how I can meet the expectations of both my worlds."}
