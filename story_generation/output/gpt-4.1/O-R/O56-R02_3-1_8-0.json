She needed a deep cleanse and careful detangling before I could even think about cutting\u2014if I rushed, I\u2019d risk damaging her hair. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder for the noon prayer service at the chapel. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the daily prayers, even if today\u2019s was routine and optional. I pictured the small group already gathering, waiting for my guidance, expecting my presence and calm. Meanwhile, Mrs. Kim trusted me to restore her hair, to take my time and do it right. My hands trembled slightly as I rinsed the suds away, torn between the sacred duty of spiritual care and the professional promise to my client. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides, forcing me to choose which part of myself to honor in this moment."}
