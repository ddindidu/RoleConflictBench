My phone buzzed\u2014a client, Mrs. Lee, had emailed with a question about a charge on her latest invoice. As an accountant, I knew I needed to respond promptly and clearly, ensuring her trust in our business. But my Bible lay open beside me, half-filled notes for Sunday\u2019s sermon scattered across the pages. As a pastor, I was expected to guide my congregation, to offer them wisdom on making honest, compassionate choices in their daily lives. The sermon was unfinished, and I felt the weight of expectation from my church family, who looked to me for spiritual direction. My mind raced between the numbers on the invoice and the words of scripture, torn between the immediate demand for financial clarity and the deeper call to prepare a message that could touch hearts. I stared at the blinking cursor in my email, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
