As a laborer, I know the drill\u2014drop everything, no questions, and head straight to the muster point. Safety is non-negotiable, and the foreman\u2019s eyes are already scanning for stragglers. But just as I turn to leave, I catch sight of a small group from the community, gathered near the fence, their faces anxious. One of them, a young man I know from church, asks about the story I\u2019d mentioned last Sunday\u2014the one about faith in the face of fear. As a pastor, I feel the pull to offer comfort, to teach, to be present in this moment of uncertainty. My heart pounds with the weight of both roles: the strict protocol of the site, the urgent need to shepherd my flock. I stand frozen, torn between the blaring alarm and the expectant eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice between duty and calling."}
