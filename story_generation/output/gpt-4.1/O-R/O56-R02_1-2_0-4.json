Mrs. Carter, a regular, beamed at me, her eyes expectant. I knew she loved our little chats, the way I remembered her grandkids\u2019 names and always asked about her garden. The receptionist was free, but Mrs. Carter always preferred my personal greeting, and I could see her waiting for that familiar warmth. At the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that Mr. Lee, a member of my congregation, was due in ten minutes. He\u2019d confided in me last Sunday, his voice trembling, and today he needed my undivided attention as his priest. My heart twisted. I could see both worlds pulling at me: the comfort I offered with a smile and a gentle touch of the comb, and the solace I was expected to give as a spiritual guide. I felt the weight of their needs, the impossibility of being fully present for both at once, and I stood there, scissors in hand, caught between the two calls."}
