An email notification pinged: a vendor had sent a standard payment confirmation. As the accountant, I knew I was expected to reply promptly and formally, maintaining the professional relationship and ensuring our records were in order. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, already composing the polite response in my mind.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was my friend from the temple, asking if I had time to discuss the sermon we\u2019d both attended last night. As a Buddhist, I valued these moments of spiritual reflection, the chance to deepen my understanding and share insights. I felt the pull to set aside my work, to be present and attentive, as my practice encouraged.\n\nBut the demands of my job pressed in. The vendor expected efficiency and professionalism; my friend expected mindfulness and presence. I felt the tension knotting in my chest, torn between the world of numbers and the world of spirit, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
