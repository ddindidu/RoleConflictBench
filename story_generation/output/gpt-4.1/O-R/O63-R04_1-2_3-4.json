I glance at the sales dashboard\u2014my numbers are soaring, and management\u2019s emails are full of praise, but also reminders: \u201cKeep pushing, don\u2019t let up.\u201d The pressure is real, but I\u2019m riding the momentum. Then my phone buzzes with a message from the mosque committee: a reminder that I\u2019m the only imam scheduled for Friday\u2019s sermon, and the topic\u2014\u201cCompassion in Community\u201d\u2014has already been announced to everyone. I know how much the congregation looks forward to these sermons, how they rely on me for guidance and inspiration. But Friday is also the last day of the sales week, and my manager has hinted at a bonus if I break the record. My mind spins with scripts and sermon notes, guilt and ambition tangling together. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that whichever role I choose to focus on, I\u2019ll be letting someone down\u2014my team, my community, or maybe even myself."}
