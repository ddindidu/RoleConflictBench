The emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just landed on my desk, and the law demanded my immediate attention. I knew I had to review every detail, every affidavit, and make a ruling within the hour\u2014someone\u2019s safety could depend on it. Yet, my Bible lay open beside the files, sermon notes scattered around. Sunday was approaching, and my congregation expected guidance, clarity, and hope from my words. I was supposed to teach them about forgiveness and justice, to help them navigate their own moral crossroads. My mind raced between the legal jargon and the scripture, the demand for swift, impartial judgment and the call to nurture souls. I felt torn, the expectations of the court and the church pulling me in opposite directions, each urgent, each sacred. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, knowing I could not fail either calling, yet unsure how to honor both."}
