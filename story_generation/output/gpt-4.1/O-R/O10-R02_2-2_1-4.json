The deadline for closing the books loomed just hours away, and every number demanded my full attention. As an accountant, accuracy was everything\u2014one mistake could ripple through the entire organization. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the reminder: a parishioner was coming in soon, seeking counsel for a struggle that had weighed on their heart for months. As their priest, I was expected to listen, to offer comfort and guidance, to be fully present. My mind raced, torn between the pressing need to finish the financial records and the sacred duty to provide spiritual support. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my undivided self. My hands hovered over the keyboard, but my thoughts drifted to the person who would soon walk through my door, hoping for solace. The clock ticked on, and I sat suspended between two callings, uncertain which to answer first."}
