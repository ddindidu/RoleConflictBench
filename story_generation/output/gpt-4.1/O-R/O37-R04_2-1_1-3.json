The hotel manager had just walked by, her eyes scanning the floor, and I could feel her silent expectation: every corner spotless, every surface gleaming. I knew the standards\u2014guests would arrive soon, and the rooms had to be perfect. Yet, my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of the time. Friday prayers were approaching, and as the imam, the congregation expected me to deliver the Khutbah, to guide them with words of wisdom and comfort. This week, though, a guest speaker was ready, prepared to step in if I couldn\u2019t make it. I could almost hear the disappointment in the elders\u2019 voices if I wasn\u2019t there, the subtle questions about my commitment. My hands trembled, torn between the mop and the pulpit, between the silent demands of cleanliness and the spoken expectations of faith. The clock ticked, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which to let down."}
