But here I was, still in my delivery uniform, clutching a moderately valuable package that required a signature. The customer wasn\u2019t home, and I\u2019d already called twice. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo signature, no delivery. Secure the package, confirm delivery, or bring it back.\u201d \n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPrepare for the service.\u201d I imagined the pews filling, the expectant faces of my community waiting for me to guide them in prayer. My heart pounded as I weighed my responsibilities. If I left now, I\u2019d let down my employer and risk losing my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d disappoint my congregation, who counted on me for spiritual support. The pressure of both worlds pressed in, and I stood frozen on the doorstep, torn between duty and devotion, unable to move."}
