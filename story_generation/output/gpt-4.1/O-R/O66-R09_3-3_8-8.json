I accept, glancing at the clock\u2014just enough time to get to the synagogue for the funeral prayer. But as I pull up, the passenger is already outside, waving frantically, phone pressed to his ear. \u201cPlease, I need to get to the hospital, fast,\u201d he says, urgency in his voice. My heart pounds. I know the minyan at the synagogue is waiting for one more to make the quorum for the kaddish, and I promised I\u2019d be there. My community expects me, especially for a funeral prayer\u2014without me, the prayer can\u2019t happen. But the passenger is desperate, and as a taxi driver, I\u2019m supposed to be reliable, to get people where they need to go, especially in emergencies. I grip the steering wheel, torn between the duty to my faith and my responsibility to my passenger, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which way to turn."}
