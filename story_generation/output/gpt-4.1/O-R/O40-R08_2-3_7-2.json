The homeowner\u2019s voice echoed in my mind\u2014she needed the deck safe for her children by tomorrow. As a carpenter, I knew the job would take hours: measuring, sawing, fitting each board just right. My hands itched to get started, to meet her expectations and prove my reliability.\n\nBut as I unloaded my tools, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the community study circle was tonight. We\u2019d be discussing verses from the Quran I hadn\u2019t yet read, let alone reflected on. As a Muslim, I was expected to come prepared, to contribute thoughtfully, to honor the words of Allah with my attention and presence.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing in. The deck needed me now, but so did my faith and my community. My mind raced, torn between the satisfaction of a job well done and the peace of spiritual growth. I stood there, caught between the scent of sawdust and the promise of sacred words, unsure which path to follow as the sun dipped lower in the sky."}
