I know I need to respond quickly, to keep everyone safe, to coordinate the new altitudes as the weather shifts. My hands hover over the console, but my mind drifts to the clock. My family is waiting, dressed in bright saris and kurtas, the puja thali ready for the ceremony. Today is special\u2014my father\u2019s voice echoed in my head this morning, reminding me not to be late, to honor our traditions. I promised I\u2019d be there, on time, in proper attire, to chant the prayers and light the lamp. But the radio blares again, another pilot needing guidance. My heart pounds, torn between the sacred duty of my faith and the critical responsibility of my job. The seconds tick by, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait."}
