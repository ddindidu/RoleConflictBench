I glanced at the dashboard clock. The city traffic was picking up, but I could make it if I left now. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, but my eyes drifted to the collar at my neck. Today was the main weekly service, the one that drew nearly everyone from the parish. They would be gathering soon, waiting for me to lead them in prayer, to offer comfort and guidance. I could already picture Mrs. Patel in the front row, her hands folded, and the children fidgeting in the pews. The ambulance dispatcher's voice urged me to hurry, but the church bells in my mind tolled insistently. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing down on me\u2014one demanding speed and action, the other presence and devotion. My heart pounded as I sat at the crossroads, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
