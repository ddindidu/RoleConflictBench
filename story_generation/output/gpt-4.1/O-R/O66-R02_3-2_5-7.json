Children clustered near the curb, their laughter rising above the hum of engines. The construction detour had squeezed the lanes, and traffic was barely moving. I glanced at the dashboard clock\u2014fifteen minutes until the religious education class I was supposed to lead at the parish. As a priest, I knew the parents and children counted on me to be there, to guide them, to keep the rhythm of their faith steady. But as a taxi driver, I was bound by the law, by the responsibility to keep these children safe, to drive slowly and carefully, no matter how late I was running. My phone buzzed with a message from the parish secretary: \u201cAre you on your way?\u201d My heart pounded. I could see the expectant faces of the children waiting for me at the church, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the vulnerable children just outside my window. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other."}
