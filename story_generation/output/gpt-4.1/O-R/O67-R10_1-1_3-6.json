Just across the street, the neighborhood was alive with color\u2014marigold garlands, incense smoke, and the rhythmic chanting of a Hindu festival. My heart tugged toward the celebration; today was a special day, one my family and community had been preparing for all week. I could almost feel the sandalwood paste on my forehead, the warmth of the diya in my hands.\n\nBut as I lingered, my mind kept circling back to the ambulance. I was expected to be ready, to provide care at a moment\u2019s notice. If a call came in, I\u2019d have to drop everything and go, no matter how much I wanted to join the prayers and rituals. The weight of my uniform pressed against my skin, a reminder of my duty. Yet, the pull of my faith was just as strong, whispering that I belonged among the devotees, not just as a bystander but as a participant. I stood there, torn, the sounds of celebration and the sterile scent of antiseptic mingling in the air, unsure which role I could honor without betraying the other."}
