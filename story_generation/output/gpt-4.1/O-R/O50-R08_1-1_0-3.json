My plan was simple: relax at home with my family, no need for the usual work attire or even a hijab since it was just us. Then my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent message from the plant manager. The old packaging machine, the one that almost never runs, was acting up again. They needed me to come in and diagnose the glitch before the next shift started.\n\nI glanced at my clothes, feeling the comfort of home, and then at the clock. If I left now, I could get there before the problem got worse. But I wasn\u2019t dressed modestly, and I knew I\u2019d have to pass by male colleagues and security staff. Changing would take time, but going as I was felt wrong, a violation of my beliefs. The expectation to be the reliable repairer clashed with my commitment to dress modestly. My mind raced, torn between the urgency of the call and the values I hold close, the weight of both roles pressing in on me as I stood frozen in the hallway."}
