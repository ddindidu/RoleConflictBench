As an architect, I was trained to catch every detail, every inconsistency, no matter how small. Today, I noticed a few minor discrepancies in the building plan\u2014nothing that would cause immediate harm, but still, not quite right. My mind raced with the responsibility to ensure safety and compliance, to uphold the standards I\u2019d sworn to maintain.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. A message from the church group: \u201cSarah\u2019s been feeling down lately. Could you check in on her?\u201d As a pastor, I knew how much a simple word of encouragement could mean. The congregation expected me to be present, to offer comfort and support, especially when someone was struggling.\n\nI stared at the plans, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. If I left my desk now, I might miss the chance to fix the plans before tomorrow\u2019s deadline. But if I waited, Sarah might feel even more alone. My heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding something different, and I sat there, torn, unsure which call to answer first."}
