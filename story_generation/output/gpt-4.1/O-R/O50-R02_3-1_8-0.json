The clock on the wall ticked closer to noon, the time I was expected in the chapel to lead the daily prayer. It was a small service, not mandatory, but the community looked to me for spiritual guidance and comfort. Yet, just down the hall, I overheard the new staff preparing to run a batch through the old press. Their laughter and nervous chatter told me they hadn\u2019t grasped the safety protocols I\u2019d tried to explain earlier. My duty as a machine repairer was clear: I needed to ensure they understood the risks, to guide them and prevent disaster. But as a priest, I was also expected to be present, to offer peace and stability through prayer. My heart pounded with the weight of both responsibilities, torn between the urgent need to protect and the quiet call to serve. I lingered in the hallway, caught between the clang of machines and the distant chime of the chapel bell, unsure which path to take."}
