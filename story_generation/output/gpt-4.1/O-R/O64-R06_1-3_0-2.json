As a cashier, I prided myself on being accurate and efficient, always double-checking prices and making sure every transaction was correct. A woman approached my register, her cart filled with groceries. As I scanned her items, I noticed a small, expensive bottle of vitamins tucked beneath a loaf of bread. It hadn\u2019t been rung up. My training was clear: process every item, no exceptions. But as I looked up, I saw her eyes dart away, and I sensed she was struggling\u2014maybe financially, maybe in some other way.\n\nAs a Christian, I was taught to show compassion, to help those in need, and to forgive. But I was also taught not to lie or enable wrongdoing. My heart pounded as I weighed my responsibilities. Should I quietly let the vitamins go, showing mercy? Or should I point out the missed item, upholding honesty and my duty as a cashier? The expectations of my job and my faith pressed in on me, each demanding something different. I hesitated, caught between the rules of my workplace and the teachings of my faith, unsure which path to take."}
