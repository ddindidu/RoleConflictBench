As a telemarketer, I was expected to take my breaks only at scheduled times, and any unscheduled absence could mean a warning or worse. My supervisor\u2019s reminders echoed in my mind: \u201cEvery minute counts.\u201d Yet, as a nun, my heart ached for the family next door whose home had just burned down. The convent phone rang with Sister Agnes\u2019s voice, urgent and pleading, \u201cWe need you to help gather food and clothing for the family\u2014right now.\u201d I could almost see their faces, frightened and lost, waiting for comfort. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the rigid demands of my job and the call to serve those in desperate need. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions, and I felt the tension coil in my chest as I tried to decide what to do next."}
