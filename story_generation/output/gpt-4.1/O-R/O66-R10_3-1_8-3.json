As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get them there quickly and safely, to be professional and efficient. But as I pulled up to the busy curb outside the mall, I saw a man step in front of the woman who\u2019d clearly been waiting longer for a cab. He flagged me down, waving cash, trying to get in before her. \n\nMy heart tightened. As a Hindu, I was taught to act with dharma\u2014to do what\u2019s right, to be fair and just. The woman looked at me, her eyes pleading, while the man insisted he was in a hurry. The app told me to pick up the man, but my conscience whispered that I should honor the woman\u2019s patience. I gripped the steering wheel, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I should meet."}
