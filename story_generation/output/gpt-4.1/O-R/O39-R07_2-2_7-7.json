I wipe the sweat from my brow, shovel still in hand, and glance at the clock\u2014two minutes to get to the trailer. The crew expects me there, alert and ready, part of the team. Missing it means risking a warning, maybe worse. But my mind drifts to the book in my backpack, the one our Buddhist study circle will discuss tonight. I haven\u2019t read the chapter yet. The others will expect thoughtful insights, honest reflection. I promised myself I\u2019d be prepared, that I\u2019d honor my commitment to the sangha. My heart pounds with the weight of both worlds: the hard hats and steel-toed boots, the quiet search for wisdom. I feel the pressure mounting, the sense that I can\u2019t fully belong to either place if I let the other down. The foreman\u2019s voice grows sharper, and I stand frozen, torn between the call of duty and the call of the Dharma, knowing I can\u2019t answer both at once."}
