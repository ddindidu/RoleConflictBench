My client\u2019s anxious voice echoed in my mind\u2014he needed my analysis before the end of the day, or he risked signing away his company\u2019s future. Every clause seemed to hide a potential pitfall, and I knew a single oversight could cost him dearly. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. In less than an hour, I was expected at the synagogue, where a roomful of children waited for their weekly Torah lesson. Their parents trusted me to guide them, to share wisdom and tradition, to be present and attentive. I could picture their eager faces, the questions they would ask, the stories I had prepared. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my client\u2019s livelihood on one side, my community\u2019s faith on the other. I felt torn, the expectations of lawyer and rabbi pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding all of me, neither willing to wait."}
