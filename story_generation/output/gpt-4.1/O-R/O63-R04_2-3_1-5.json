As a telemarketer, I was supposed to handle every objection, every question, with patience and precision. But today, the calls were relentless\u2014prospects kept asking about the technical details of our new service, details my script only skimmed. My supervisor\u2019s messages popped up: \u201cDon\u2019t transfer calls. Handle them yourself.\u201d My heart pounded as I fumbled through answers, feeling the pressure mount.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a reminder. I was the imam, too. Today was the community\u2019s milestone Friday, and people had travelled from far and wide to hear my sermon. They expected inspiration, guidance, a voice steady with faith. The mosque committee had called twice already, asking if I\u2019d arrive early to greet the elders.\n\nI glanced at the clock. The calls wouldn\u2019t stop, and neither would the expectations. My mind raced between the demands of my job and the weight of my spiritual duty. I felt torn, my chest tight with anxiety, as I tried to decide which role I could let down the least."}
