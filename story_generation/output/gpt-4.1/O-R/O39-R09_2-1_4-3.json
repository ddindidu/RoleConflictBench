My supervisor always says safety comes first\u2014any spill, no matter how minor, has to be cleaned up right away. I grabbed the mop and bucket, but as I reached for the cleaning supplies, I realized my hands were still sticky from the kosher snack I\u2019d just eaten. I\u2019d been careful to keep my food separate, following the rules I grew up with\u2014no mixing, no contamination. The cleaning rags, though, were stored right next to the non-kosher lunch leftovers from the other guys. If I used them, I\u2019d risk getting non-kosher residue on my hands, maybe even on my clothes, and I\u2019d have to go through the whole process of washing up before I could eat again. But if I hesitated, someone could slip and get hurt. My heart pounded as I stood there, mop in hand, torn between the safety everyone expected from me and the laws I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never break."}
