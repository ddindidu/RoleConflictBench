As the team\u2019s engineer, I was expected to provide accurate time estimates for the new project. The session was informal, and I knew the timeline could still shift, but everyone looked to me for clarity. I wanted to be thorough and professional, to show my commitment to the team.\n\nBut my mind kept drifting to the office function scheduled for this afternoon. It was a big event, with colleagues from every department, men and women mingling freely. As a Muslim, I always tried to dress modestly, following Islamic guidelines. I worried about standing out or being judged if I wore my usual long sleeves and loose clothing, especially since most of my colleagues would be dressed more casually for the occasion.\n\nThe pressure built inside me\u2014on one hand, the expectation to be a reliable, approachable engineer, blending in with the team; on the other, my commitment to my faith and the modesty it required. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something different, and I sat there, torn, unsure how to move forward."}
