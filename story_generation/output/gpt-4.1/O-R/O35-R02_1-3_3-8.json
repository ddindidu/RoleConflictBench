I answered calmly, giving clear directions, as expected of me\u2014always helpful, always alert. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a message from the parish: the Martinez family needed me tonight for their child\u2019s final sacrament preparation. It was the only time before the ceremony, and they were counting on me to guide them, to be present, to fulfill my promise as their priest. My shift wouldn\u2019t end until late, and I couldn\u2019t leave the train. My mind raced\u2014my duty to the passengers, to their safety and needs, versus my responsibility to my parishioners, to their faith and their child\u2019s milestone. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me, the collar and the cap, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait. The train rumbled on, and I stared at the tunnel ahead, heart pounding, torn between two worlds that needed me now."}
