I\u2019ve been with your company for years!\u201d My script as a telemarketer urged me to stay calm, to answer every objection with patience and clarity, to keep him on the line and win back his trust. My supervisor\u2019s expectations echoed in my mind: never let a customer go unsatisfied.\n\nBut as I tried to explain the offer, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014Eli\u2019s bar mitzvah was in less than an hour. As his rabbi, I was expected to be present, to guide him through this sacred rite, to support his family with warmth and wisdom.
