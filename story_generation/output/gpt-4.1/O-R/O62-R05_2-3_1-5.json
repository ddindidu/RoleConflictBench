The sun glinted off the surface, and the usual chatter of children echoed around me. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the conversion candidate\u2019s final study session was about to begin. He\u2019d waited months for this, and I was the one who\u2019d guided him through every step. He needed me now, to answer his last questions, to reassure him before his Beit Din. But as I glanced at the deep end, I saw a swimmer\u2019s arm flail, a sign of distress. My training screamed at me to stay alert, to be ready to dive in at any second. Yet my heart tugged toward my student, who was waiting for me in the synagogue library, counting on my presence and wisdom. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the red lifeguard shirt and the rabbinic kippah\u2014pressing on my shoulders, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My mind raced, torn between the urgent needs of body and soul, between saving a life in the water and guiding a soul on land."}
