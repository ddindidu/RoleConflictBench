As a telemarketer, I was used to handling objections\u2014most callers were polite, and their questions rarely strayed from what my script could answer. Today, though, my mind wandered. In just a few hours, I would be leading an intensive workshop for community leaders at church, diving into complex theological concepts that demanded clarity and depth. The congregation expected me to guide them, to teach with patience and wisdom.\n\nBut now, as a customer asked about a product feature, I caught myself reciting the script mechanically, my thoughts tangled in tomorrow\u2019s lesson plan. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one demanding efficiency and adherence to a script, the other calling for deep reflection and spiritual insight. My heart raced as I realized I couldn\u2019t give my full self to either. The phone line buzzed with the customer\u2019s next question, and I hesitated, torn between the demands of my job and the expectations of my calling."}
