How can I help you today?\u201d The customer\u2019s voice was sharp, firing off technical questions about our new internet package\u2014questions my script only half-covered. I tried to sound confident, flipping through the FAQ, but my answers felt hollow. My supervisor expected me to handle every objection smoothly, to never let a customer sense uncertainty. Each call left me more tense, my mind racing with what I should have said.\n\nBetween calls, my phone buzzed with a message from Farid, a community member from the mosque. \u201cImam, I\u2019d love to talk when you have a moment. Need some advice.\u201d I knew what was expected of me as an imam: to listen, to guide, to be present and compassionate. But the calls kept coming, and my break was only ten minutes. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the demands of my job and the needs of my community. My heart ached with the weight of both roles, unsure how to be enough for either."}
