The courtroom was silent, every word I spoke carrying the weight of the law. Suddenly, my clerk slipped me a note\u2014an urgent alert. The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was relying on. My mind raced. I was expected, as a judge, to stay current, to ensure justice was served according to the latest law. I knew I had to stop, reconsider, and possibly rewrite everything on the spot.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. The special healing service for Sister Agnes was about to begin. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to pray and support my community, especially in moments of need. The sisters would notice my absence, and I felt the pull of my vows, the call to compassion and solidarity.\n\nI stood frozen, the weight of the gavel in one hand and my rosary in the other, torn between the demands of justice and the call of faith, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
