My next client, Anna, rushed in, cheeks flushed and hair damp from her gym session. She apologized for being late, mentioning she\u2019d come straight from her workout. I could see the sweat and oil in her hair, and as a hairdresser, I knew I should wash and condition it before starting the cut. That was my professional duty\u2014to ensure cleanliness and give her the best service.\n\nBut today was supposed to be different. I had arranged my schedule so I could return to the convent early. The sisters were all spending the afternoon in quiet spiritual study, and I longed for that peace, to sit with my scriptures and reflect. As a nun, I was expected to devote myself to these moments of contemplation, to nurture my soul and deepen my faith.\n\nStanding there, scissors in hand, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. Anna looked at me expectantly, trusting me to care for her hair. Yet my heart ached for the silence and stillness waiting for me at the convent. I hesitated, torn between the needs of my client and the call of my spiritual life."}
