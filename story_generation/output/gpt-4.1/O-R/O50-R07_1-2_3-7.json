The machines, old and temperamental, needed careful cleaning and tuning\u2014if I missed this window, their performance would suffer, and the team would be frustrated. My supervisor had already reminded me twice: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any delays, especially from you.\u201d I felt the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders.\n\nBut tonight, the sangha was gathering for our weekly study circle. We were finally discussing a chapter I\u2019d been waiting for, one that delved into mindfulness and detachment\u2014teachings I\u2019d hoped would deepen my practice. The group expected me to be there, to share insights and help guide the discussion. My teacher had gently encouraged me, \u201cYour presence matters to the community.\u201d\n\nI felt torn, the hum of the machines echoing in my mind alongside the quiet call of the Dharma. The demands of my hands and the needs of my heart seemed to pull me in opposite directions. I stood in the workshop, caught between the clang of metal and the promise of stillness, uncertain which path to follow."}
