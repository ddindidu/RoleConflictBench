It was Sunday morning, and the church bells across the street had just begun to ring. My heart ached a little; I hadn\u2019t missed a service in years, and the thought of not joining my church family in worship made me feel hollow. But I was on shift, uniform crisp, ready to respond to any emergency. The dispatcher\u2019s voice crackled in my ear, reminding me to stay alert. I knew the expectation: lives depended on my speed, my focus, my presence here. Yet, as the hymns drifted through the open window, I felt the pull of my faith, the need to be present in the pews, to pray and sing and be part of something bigger than myself. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my loyalty, each unwilling to wait. The radio stayed silent, but my mind was anything but."}
