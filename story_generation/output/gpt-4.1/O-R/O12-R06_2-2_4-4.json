My phone buzzed with another Slack message from the product team, asking for my input on the new feature. The deadline was looming, and I knew the other teams were waiting on me to move forward. My manager had emphasized the importance of collaboration, and I didn\u2019t want to let anyone down. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized the church service would start in less than an hour. I hadn\u2019t missed a Sunday in months, and being present was more than a habit\u2014it was a commitment to my faith and my community. I could already imagine the warmth of familiar faces, the comfort of worship, and the sense of belonging. Yet, the weight of my professional responsibility pressed on me. If I left now, I\u2019d be letting my colleagues down; if I stayed, I\u2019d be neglecting a core part of who I am. My heart pounded as I sat at the crossroads, torn between two worlds that both mattered deeply to me."}
