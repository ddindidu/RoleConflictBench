My heart leapt. I knew I had to shout, to break the silence and warn him, just as my phone buzzed in my pocket. I glanced down: a message from the synagogue president. \u201cRabbi, Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s family needs you. The funeral must be this afternoon.\u201d My mind spun. As a laborer, I was responsible for everyone\u2019s safety, to act without hesitation. But as a rabbi, I was expected to drop everything, to be present for grieving families, to guide them through their darkest hour. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014one demanding immediate action, the other calling me to sacred duty. My throat tightened as I stood between the clang of steel and the silent ache of loss, torn by the urgency of both calls."}
