The station was clear across town, and traffic was already thickening. As a taxi driver, I felt the weight of his expectation\u2014get him there safely, but quickly. My hands tightened on the wheel.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Miriam, a member of my congregation. Her father had just passed away. \u201cRabbi, we need you for the funeral as soon as possible,\u201d she wrote. My heart clenched. As their rabbi, I was expected to be present, to guide them through grief, to honor the deceased.\n\nI stared at the red light ahead, feeling pulled in two directions. My passenger\u2019s anxious eyes met mine in the rearview mirror, while Miriam\u2019s words echoed in my mind. Both needed me, both urgently. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014how could I possibly fulfill both roles at once? My mind raced, torn between the road ahead and the sacred duty waiting for me."}
