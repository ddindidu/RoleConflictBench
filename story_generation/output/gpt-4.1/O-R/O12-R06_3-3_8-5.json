The production outage was traced back to a bug in my code, and now hundreds of customers couldn\u2019t access the service. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need you on this, now.\u201d I felt the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders\u2014users were counting on me, and the company\u2019s reputation was at stake.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I realized it was almost time for the weekly church service. I\u2019d promised to help set up, and my pastor had reminded me how important it was to be present, not just for worship but for the community that relied on me. I could already imagine the disappointment if I didn\u2019t show up\u2014my absence would be noticed, and I\u2019d feel like I was letting down my church family and my faith.\n\nCaught between the urgent demands of my job and the deep commitments of my faith, I felt torn. My mind raced, anxiety building as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which responsibility I should honor first."}
