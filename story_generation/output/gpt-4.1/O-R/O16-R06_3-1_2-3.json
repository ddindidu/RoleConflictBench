As a doctor, I knew my duty: every patient deserved my full attention, especially the man who had just been rushed in, gasping for breath, his skin pale and clammy. His symptoms were baffling, and I needed to focus, to sift through every possible diagnosis, order the right tests, and act quickly. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized the church bells would soon ring. My congregation would gather, voices rising in worship, and I felt the familiar tug of my Christian faith. I had promised myself I\u2019d make it to service this week, to reconnect with my community and God. Yet here I was, torn between the sacred call to worship and the urgent need to heal. My heart ached with guilt and longing, caught between the expectations of my profession and my faith, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
