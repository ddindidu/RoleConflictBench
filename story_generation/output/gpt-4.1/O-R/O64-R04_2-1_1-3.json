My manager\u2019s eyes flicked to the clock, urging me to keep the line moving. Every beep of the register reminded me of the time\u2014Jummah was approaching, and as the imam, I was expected to deliver the sermon. The congregation counted on me for guidance, especially today, when the topic was unity in hardship. Yet, the store was short-staffed, and my manager had already asked me to stay through the rush. I knew a guest speaker was ready at the mosque, but I also knew the community valued my presence and words. My hands moved automatically, but my mind raced between the demands of my job and my duty to my faith. Each expectation pulled at me, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides, and I felt the tension knotting in my chest as the clock ticked closer to prayer time."}
