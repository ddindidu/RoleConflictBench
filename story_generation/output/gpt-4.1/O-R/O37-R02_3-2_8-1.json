The hospital\u2019s safety protocols were strict\u2014no exceptions. Every surface had to be sanitized, every tool disinfected, and I was expected to set an example for the other cleaners. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart pounded faster. The main weekly service at the chapel was about to begin, and as the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, offer comfort, and be present for everyone who needed spiritual guidance.\n\nI could already imagine the congregation gathering, waiting for me to appear in my robes, calm and composed. But here I was, still in my cleaning uniform, surrounded by the sharp scent of bleach and the weight of responsibility. If I left now, I\u2019d be breaking protocol, risking contamination and possibly endangering others. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my community, who looked to me for hope and connection. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt torn, caught between duty and devotion, unable to see a way forward."}
