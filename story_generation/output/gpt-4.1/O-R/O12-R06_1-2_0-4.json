The module was a mess\u2014spaghetti logic, cryptic variable names, and a tangle of quick fixes. My team lead had given me a generous deadline, trusting I\u2019d refactor it into something clean and maintainable. I knew I could do it right if I put in the hours now, and I wanted to prove myself, to show I cared about the craft.\n\nBut Sunday was approaching, and with it, the expectation to be present at church. Not just to sit in a pew, but to worship, to connect, to serve. I\u2019d missed a couple of services lately, telling myself I\u2019d make up for it, but the guilt gnawed at me. My faith wasn\u2019t just a checkbox; it was supposed to shape my life, my priorities. Yet here I was, torn between the satisfaction of a job well done and the call to be part of something bigger than myself.\n\nThe clock ticked on, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my time, my heart, my best."}
