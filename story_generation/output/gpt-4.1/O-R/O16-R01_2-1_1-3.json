The symptoms didn\u2019t fit neatly into any box\u2014fever, fatigue, a rash that came and went. As a doctor, I was expected to find answers, to give clarity and hope. But nothing in the tests or textbooks matched what I saw. I felt the weight of my white coat, the silent pressure to be certain, to be right.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. A message from the church secretary: \u201cMrs. Evans is having a hard time. She could use a visit.\u201d As a pastor, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and a listening ear. I remembered how Mrs. Evans always smiled at me after Sunday service, and guilt pricked at me for not noticing her sadness sooner.\n\nI looked at the clock, torn. My patient needed answers, but Mrs. Evans needed support. Both roles demanded my full attention, my compassion, my time. I felt split in two, the expectations of healer and shepherd pulling me in opposite directions, and I sat there, heart heavy, unsure which need to answer first."}
