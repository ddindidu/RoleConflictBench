My job as a telemarketer is clear: follow the script, handle objections, and answer questions as best I can. But today, the calls are different. Prospects keep asking technical questions that the script only half-answers. My supervisor expects me to keep the calls moving, not to get bogged down, but I feel the pressure to be honest and helpful. My stomach rumbles. I reach for a snack, remembering the kosher crackers in the pantry. I always make sure to observe kosher laws, even at work, and I\u2019m grateful for the options. But as I chew, another call comes in. The customer\u2019s questions are sharp, and I feel the tension between giving a full answer and sticking to the script. My Jewish values push me toward honesty and integrity, but my job demands efficiency and adherence to the script. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, my mind racing as I try to decide what to do next."}
