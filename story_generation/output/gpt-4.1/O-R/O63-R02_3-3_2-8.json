My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cHandle every objection, don\u2019t let them hang up.\u201d I tried to keep my tone calm, explaining every detail, but he kept interrupting, wanting proof, reassurance, something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Lopez: \u201cFather, we need you for the final sacrament class. It\u2019s the only time before Sunday.\u201d I pictured her anxious face, her child\u2019s wide eyes, the whole family counting on me to guide them through this sacred milestone.
