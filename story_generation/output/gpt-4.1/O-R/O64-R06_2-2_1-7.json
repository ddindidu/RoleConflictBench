My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cKeep the line moving, no mistakes.\u201d I scan groceries, punch in codes, and force a polite smile, but my heart isn\u2019t in it. Halfway through, I spot Mrs. Evans, a regular from church, her face drawn and eyes red. She fumbles with her wallet, hands trembling. I remember the prayer request she shared last Sunday\u2014her husband\u2019s illness, the mounting bills. I want to pause, to offer a gentle word or a prayer, to show the compassion my faith calls me to. But the line behind her grows restless, a man sighs loudly, and my supervisor glances over. I feel torn\u2014my job demands speed and efficiency, but my faith urges me to slow down and care. My hands hover over the register, my mind racing, caught between the expectations of my workplace and the teachings I hold dear."}
