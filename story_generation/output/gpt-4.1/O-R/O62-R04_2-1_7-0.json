A group of teenagers laughed, daring each other to dive from the shallow end, right beneath the bold red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d sign. My training as a lifeguard screamed at me to intervene\u2014safety rules weren\u2019t just guidelines, they were lifelines. But as I took a step forward, my phone buzzed. It was nearly time for Asr prayer, and I was expected at the mosque to lead. I knew another brother could step in, and the congregation would be small, but I also knew the weight of my responsibility as imam. The community looked to me for guidance, for presence, for consistency. My heart pounded as I watched the teens edge closer to danger, while the minutes ticked toward prayer. I felt torn, pulled by the urgent need to enforce safety here and the quiet, steady expectation of spiritual leadership there. The demands pressed in from both sides, and I stood frozen, caught between the pool\u2019s edge and the mosque\u2019s call."}
