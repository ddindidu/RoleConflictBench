The label matched, the dosage was correct, and I felt the familiar satisfaction of fulfilling my duty as a pharmacist\u2014ensuring every detail was perfect for the patient\u2019s safety. Just as I was about to hand the medication to the waiting mother, my phone buzzed urgently. It was a reminder: the bar mitzvah I was to officiate would begin in less than an hour. Months of preparation, a family\u2019s anticipation, and a young boy\u2019s rite of passage all depended on my presence as their rabbi. \n\nBut the pharmacy was short-staffed today, and my manager had already asked me to stay late to cover for a sick colleague. If I left now, prescriptions would be delayed, and patients might go without their needed medications. If I stayed, I would let down a family and a community who trusted me to guide them through a sacred moment. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both white coat and tallit pressing down on my shoulders, torn between two worlds that needed me at the very same time."}
