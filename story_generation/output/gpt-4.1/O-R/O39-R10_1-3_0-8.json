My supervisor called me over, pointing to a stack of unused bricks. \u201cMove these to the back storage before you leave today,\u201d he said, his tone leaving no room for argument. I nodded, feeling the weight of the task settle on my shoulders. But my mind was already elsewhere\u2014today was the festival of Navratri, and my family was waiting for me to join them at the temple, hours away. As a Hindu, it was my duty to participate in the rituals, to offer prayers and be present with my loved ones. The thought of missing the festival filled me with guilt and sadness. Yet, the expectation at work was clear: finish the job, no excuses. I glanced at the bricks, then at the clock, feeling the pressure from both sides. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice\u2014fulfill my responsibility as a laborer, or honor my faith and family."}
