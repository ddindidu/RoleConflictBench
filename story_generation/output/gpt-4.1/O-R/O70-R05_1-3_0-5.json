The delivery window was tight, but I\u2019d made it\u2014barely. My boss had texted twice already, reminding me that late deliveries meant complaints, and complaints meant trouble. I hurried up the steps, package in hand, but my mind was elsewhere. In just thirty minutes, I was supposed to meet Miriam, the conversion candidate, for her final study session before her Beit Din. She was anxious, and I\u2019d promised to help her review the laws and prayers one last time. I could picture her waiting at the synagogue, clutching her notes, counting on me to guide her through this pivotal moment. My phone buzzed again: another delivery added to my route, just a few blocks away, but it would eat into the time I\u2019d set aside for Miriam. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my job demanded punctuality, but my calling as a rabbi demanded presence and care. I stood on the porch, package in hand, heart pounding, torn between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
