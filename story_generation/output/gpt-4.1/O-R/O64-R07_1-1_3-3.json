The store is quiet, and I\u2019m supposed to have my ten-minute meditation soon\u2014a promise I made to myself to practice mindfulness, to breathe and let go. But as I tally the drawer, I notice a small discrepancy. It\u2019s not much, just a few coins off, and it doesn\u2019t affect the total sales. Still, the store policy is clear: every cent must be accounted for, every mistake reported. My manager expects precision, no exceptions.\n\nI glance at the clock. My meditation window is about to start. I feel the tension rising in my chest\u2014the urge to let go, to sit quietly and observe my breath, clashing with the responsibility to follow procedure, to double-check, to fill out forms. My hands hover over the register, torn between closing it up and stepping away, or staying to investigate. The store is empty, the world outside silent, but inside me, the demands of duty and the call for inner peace wrestle for my attention."}
