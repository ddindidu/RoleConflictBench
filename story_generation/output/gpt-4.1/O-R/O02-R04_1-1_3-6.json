This week, I finally had a stretch of quiet time\u2014perfect for updating our safety records before the next routine audit, which is still months away. I sat at my desk, spreadsheets open, feeling the satisfaction of being ahead of schedule.\n\nThen, my phone buzzed. It was Ahmed, a member of my congregation. He\u2019d mentioned after Friday prayers that he wanted to talk, \u201cwhenever you have a free moment, Imam.\u201d I knew from his tone it was important, though he hadn\u2019t pressed for a specific time. Now, as I stared at my screen, I felt the weight of both roles. My engineering side urged me to seize this rare uninterrupted time to perfect our compliance files. But as an imam, I knew Ahmed might be struggling, waiting for guidance, and expecting me to be available when I could.\n\nThe expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my duty to my team and my responsibility to my community. I sat there, torn, the cursor blinking, my phone silent but heavy in my hand, unsure which role to answer first."}
