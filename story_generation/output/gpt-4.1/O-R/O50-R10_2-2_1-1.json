My mind, though, kept drifting to home. At 7:00, I was supposed to light the lamp and offer prayers at my altar, a daily ritual that brought me peace and connection. My mother had called earlier, gently reminding me not to miss it again. The expectation weighed on me: to be present, to honor my faith, to keep the tradition alive. But here, the team relied on me to fix the machine, to keep production moving. I felt the pressure from both sides\u2014my hands trembling as I tightened a bolt, my heart aching with guilt and anxiety.
