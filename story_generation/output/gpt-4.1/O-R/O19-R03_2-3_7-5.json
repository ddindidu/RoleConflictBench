My phone buzzed with a reminder: the workshop on updated prescription guidelines was starting in an hour. As a pharmacist, I knew how crucial it was to stay current\u2014patients depended on my knowledge, and the hospital expected me to provide the best counseling possible. But just as I was gathering my notes, Sister Agnes entered, her face alight with excitement. \u201cYou\u2019ve been chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the cathedral tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor for our convent.\u201d\n\nMy heart pounded. The vigil was at the same time as the workshop. The sisters expected me to represent our faith, to guide the prayers with devotion and grace. Yet, my colleagues at the pharmacy relied on me to be diligent and informed. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the sacred and the scientific, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to yield. I closed my eyes, torn between the call of my profession and the call of my faith, unsure which path to follow."}
