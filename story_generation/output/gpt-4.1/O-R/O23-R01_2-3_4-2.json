My client\u2019s future depended on my preparation and presence; they trusted me to defend their interests with every ounce of skill I possessed. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from the church secretary: someone from the congregation was in crisis, waiting in my office, desperate for spiritual guidance. Their choices now could shape the rest of their life, and they needed me not as a lawyer, but as a pastor\u2014someone to listen, to pray, to help them find clarity in the storm. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be wholly present. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the courtroom and the sanctuary, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
