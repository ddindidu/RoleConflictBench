My Bible and journal waited on my desk, sunlight slanting through the window, promising peace. But just as I settled in, my phone buzzed: a last-minute delivery request. I hesitated, torn. As a delivery person, I was expected to respond promptly, to greet customers with a smile and hand over their packages with professionalism and warmth. But as a nun, I was supposed to honor my commitment to spiritual growth, to carve out time for prayer and contemplation. Now, standing at the customer\u2019s door, I felt the weight of both roles. I forced a polite smile, but my mind was still in the quiet of my room, longing for the solace I\u2019d planned. The customer chatted, expecting my full attention, while my heart wrestled with guilt for neglecting my spiritual duties. I wondered if I could truly serve both callings, or if I was failing at both."}
