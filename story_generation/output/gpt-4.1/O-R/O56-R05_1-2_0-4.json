As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to greet every client warmly, make them feel at home, and today, the salon was quiet enough for a real conversation. The receptionist was free, but Mrs. Goldstein always preferred my welcome. I could see her looking for me, expecting that familiar comfort. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the children\u2019s Torah class at the synagogue was about to begin. As the rabbi, I\u2019m responsible for teaching them, guiding them through stories and laws that shape their lives. I could picture the kids gathering, waiting for me to start. My heart pounded as I stood between the salon chair and the door, torn by the weight of two communities, each expecting my presence, my warmth, my guidance. I felt the pressure mounting, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once, and the decision pressed in on me, heavy and unresolved."}
