The design documents for our new feature were due tomorrow, and the other teams were waiting for my technical input. My manager had just sent a reminder: \u201cLet\u2019s finalize everything at the office function this afternoon. Everyone will be there\u2014great chance to collaborate!\u201d I knew how important it was to be present, to answer questions, to show I was a team player. But as I glanced at the invitation, I remembered the dress code: \u201cBusiness casual\u2014no jeans, please!\u201d I felt a knot in my stomach. For me, dressing modestly isn\u2019t just a preference; it\u2019s a part of my faith. I always wore long sleeves and loose clothing, but I worried about standing out, about being judged or misunderstood by colleagues who didn\u2019t know my reasons. I wanted to be seen as professional, not difficult or distant. The pressure to fit in, to be approachable, clashed with my need to stay true to my beliefs. As the clock ticked closer to the event, I felt torn, caught between my commitment to my team and my commitment to my faith, unsure how to move forward."}
