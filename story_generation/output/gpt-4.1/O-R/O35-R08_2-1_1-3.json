I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d need to leave the house, let alone work. But just as I was settling in, my supervisor called: an operator had called in sick, and they needed me to cover the morning shift. I barely had time to change, and in my rush, I threw on a long coat over my pajamas, hoping it would be enough.\n\nNow, as I sit in the operator\u2019s seat, I\u2019m hyper-aware of my appearance. The coat covers me, but I worry it might slip or look unprofessional. At the same time, a signal delay up ahead demands my full attention. I need to adjust the train\u2019s speed carefully\u2014too fast, and I risk passenger safety; too slow, and I\u2019ll throw off the schedule. My mind is split: part of me is focused on the controls, the other part is anxious about whether I\u2019m upholding my faith\u2019s expectations for modesty, especially in a public, responsible role. The pressure from both sides presses in, and I feel caught between two worlds, unsure which to prioritize."}
