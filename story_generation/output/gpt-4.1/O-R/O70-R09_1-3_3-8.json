No one answered the doorbell, so I prepared to leave the box safely at the doorstep, snapping a photo for proof. My phone buzzed with a message from the synagogue: they needed one more person for the minyan at a funeral prayer, and I was the only one nearby. My heart pounded. As a delivery person, I was expected to finish my route on time and ensure every package was secure, especially in this neighborhood where thefts had been reported. But as a Jew, I knew how important it was to help form the minyan, especially for a funeral prayer\u2014without me, the service couldn\u2019t proceed. I stared at the package in my hands, torn between my duty to my job and my responsibility to my community and faith. The minutes ticked by, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
