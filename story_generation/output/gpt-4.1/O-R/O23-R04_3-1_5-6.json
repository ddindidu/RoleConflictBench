My client\u2019s future\u2014and a small fortune\u2014rested on my ability to argue their case. The judge had made it clear: no more delays. I had to be in court, sharp and focused, for every moment of the multi-day trial. As I reviewed my notes, my phone buzzed with a message from Ahmed, a gentle soul from the mosque. He\u2019d mentioned after Friday prayers that he was struggling and would appreciate some time to talk, \u201cwhenever you\u2019re free, Imam.\u201d I knew from his tone that he needed more than casual advice; he needed real guidance, perhaps even urgent support. The community expected me to be present, compassionate, and available. But the courtroom demanded my undivided attention. My mind raced, torn between my duty to my client and my responsibility to my congregation. I felt the tension coil in my chest, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
