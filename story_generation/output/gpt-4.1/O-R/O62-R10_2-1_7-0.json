The sun was relentless, but my mind was elsewhere, quietly repeating the Gayatri mantra under my breath. It was my way of staying connected, even if I couldn\u2019t perform the full morning puja before my shift. My family always said the rituals should be done properly, with full attention, but I told myself that even a whispered prayer was better than nothing.\n\nSuddenly, a group of teenagers started roughhousing near the deep end, ignoring the bold red \u201cNO DIVING\u201d signs. My training as a lifeguard kicked in\u2014safety first, always. I was supposed to be alert, ready to intervene at a moment\u2019s notice. But as I watched them, I realized I\u2019d lost track of my mantra, my mind split between duty and devotion. I felt a pang of guilt\u2014was I neglecting my faith by not focusing, or my job by letting my attention wander? The expectation to be vigilant clashed with the need to honor my beliefs, and for a moment, I was frozen, torn between blowing the whistle and finishing my prayer."}
