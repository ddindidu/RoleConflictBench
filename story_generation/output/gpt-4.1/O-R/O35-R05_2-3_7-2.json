Today\u2019s agenda: new safety protocols, mandatory attendance, no exceptions. My phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014High Holiday service in two hours. As the rabbi, I was expected to deliver a sermon that would guide and inspire the congregation, especially on a day when every seat in the synagogue would be filled. My notes were unfinished, my thoughts scattered. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the transit authority demanded my presence and focus, while my community needed my spiritual leadership. I glanced at the clock, heart pounding, torn between the duty to keep the subway running safely and the responsibility to offer words of comfort and hope. The supervisor called my name, and I felt the expectations of two worlds collide inside me, each unwilling to yield."}
