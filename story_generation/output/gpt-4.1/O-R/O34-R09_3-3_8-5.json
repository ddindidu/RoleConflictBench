An emergency diversion was unfolding\u2014an aircraft needed to cut across three sectors, and I was the point of contact. My colleagues expected me to coordinate swiftly, to keep the airspace safe and traffic flowing. The pressure was immense; every second counted.\n\nAt the same time, the communal event for controllers was underway in the break room. The aroma of catered food drifted in, and my stomach reminded me I hadn\u2019t eaten since dawn. But as I glanced at the spread, I realized none of it was kosher-certified. The expectation from my family and community was clear: I should observe kosher laws, even if it meant going hungry.\n\nMy radio crackled with urgent voices, demanding my full attention. Yet, the sight of my colleagues laughing and sharing plates gnawed at me. I felt torn\u2014between the duty to my team and the commitment to my faith. The demands pressed in from both sides, and I sat frozen, wrestling with which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
