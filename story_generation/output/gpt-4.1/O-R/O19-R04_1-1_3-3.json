I glanced at the clock\u2014just an hour before Friday prayers. I knew I should take time to counsel her properly, explain side effects, and check for interactions, but my mind was already at the mosque. As the imam, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah, a responsibility I cherished and took seriously. Yet today, a guest speaker was ready to step in if I couldn\u2019t make it. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to my patient, who needed more than a rushed answer, and the duty to my congregation, who looked to me for spiritual guidance. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my presence, each expecting my full attention. I stood there, torn, the woman waiting for my advice, the mosque waiting for my words, and I struggled to decide where I was needed most."}
