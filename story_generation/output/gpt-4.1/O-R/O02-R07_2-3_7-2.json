My manager\u2019s email was curt: \u201cWe need your estimates by noon for the quarterly roadmap.\u201d I knew the team was waiting on me, and any delay would ripple through the entire project. I tried to focus, but my phone buzzed with a message from the monastery. The annual festival was tomorrow, and preparations started at dawn. They needed volunteers\u2014needed me. I\u2019d promised to help, and as a practicing Buddhist, I felt a deep responsibility to support my community, especially during this sacred event.\n\nMy mind spun between the two worlds. As an engineer, I was expected to be precise, reliable, and available for the team. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be present, selfless, and committed to the sangha. Both roles demanded my full attention, both at the same time. I felt my chest tighten, torn between the logic of deadlines and the call of compassion. I closed my eyes, searching for clarity, but the weight of conflicting expectations pressed in, leaving me suspended in indecision."}
