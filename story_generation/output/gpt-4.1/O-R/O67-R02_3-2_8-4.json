My hands gripped the wheel, knuckles white, as I navigated the ambulance through the storm. The patient in the back was fading fast, every second precious, but the roads were slick and visibility was almost nothing. I knew I had to drive safely\u2014one wrong move and we\u2019d never make it to the hospital. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was supposed to meet with Mrs. Carter at the church in fifteen minutes. She\u2019d confided in me about her struggles, and today she needed my guidance more than ever. I could almost hear her voice, trembling with hope that I\u2019d help her find peace.
