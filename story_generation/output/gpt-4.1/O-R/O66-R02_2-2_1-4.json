My passenger, a young woman clutching her train ticket, kept checking her phone, anxiety etched on her face. \u201cPlease, I can\u2019t miss this train,\u201d she pleaded. As a taxi driver, I felt the pressure to get her to the station on time, weaving through traffic, calculating shortcuts in my mind. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: in fifteen minutes, I was supposed to meet Mr. Harris at the church. He\u2019d confided in me last Sunday, desperate for guidance, and I\u2019d promised to be there for him. The weight of both roles pressed on my chest\u2014one demanded speed and focus on the road, the other, compassion and presence. I gripped the steering wheel tighter, torn between the urgency of my passenger\u2019s journey and the quiet suffering of a soul waiting for counsel. The city\u2019s noise faded as my thoughts raced, caught between the expectations of the collar around my neck and the meter ticking on my dashboard."}
