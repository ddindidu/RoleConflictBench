Ramadan\u2019s midpoint has come, and I\u2019m behind on my daily reading. The guilt gnaws at me\u2014my faith asks for reflection, for time with the words that give me peace. But the site is strict; safety and cleanliness are non-negotiable. If I leave my corner unswept, someone could slip, and I could lose my job. My hands ache from the day\u2019s labor, but my heart aches more, torn between the duty to my work and the duty to my faith. I glance at the clock, calculating if I can do both, but the minutes slip away. The broom\u2019s handle feels heavy, the Quran\u2019s pages even heavier. I stand in the middle of the site, caught between the dust and the verses, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
