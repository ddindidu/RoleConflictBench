My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d I dial another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my heart isn\u2019t in it. Tonight is the weekly Buddhist study circle, and we\u2019re finally discussing the chapter on right livelihood\u2014a teaching I\u2019ve been eager to explore. I promised myself I\u2019d be there, present and mindful, not distracted by work or worry. Yet here I am, torn. If I leave now, I let my team down and risk my own financial stability. If I stay, I miss the chance to deepen my practice and connect with my sangha. The pressure mounts with every unanswered call, every minute ticking by. My mind races, caught between the demands of my job and the pull of my spiritual path, each tugging at me with equal urgency."}
