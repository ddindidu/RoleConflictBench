My phone buzzes\u2014another Slack message from QA. \u201cUI glitch on the dashboard again. Users are confused. Can you check ASAP?\u201d I know the bug; it\u2019s minor, and there\u2019s a simple workaround, but the expectation is clear: fix it now, reassure the team, keep the workflow smooth.\n\nMy mind tugs in two directions. As a developer, I\u2019m supposed to be responsive, reliable, always ready to jump in and solve problems. But as a Buddhist, I\u2019ve committed to mindfulness, to honoring this daily pause, to not letting work consume every moment. I feel the tension coil in my chest\u2014guilt for even considering ignoring the bug, frustration at the timing, and a quiet longing for the peace I crave. My cursor hovers over the code editor, but my eyes drift to the meditation cushion in the corner. The demands of both roles press in, and I sit, caught between the urgent ping of responsibility and the silent call to stillness, unsure which to answer first."}
