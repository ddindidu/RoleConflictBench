It was an invitation to a professional development seminar\u2014optional, but the kind of thing that showed commitment to my job. I knew my supervisor would notice who signed up. At the same time, my habit pressed against my collar, a gentle reminder of my other life. Just as I was about to reply to the email, my parish\u2019s deacon texted: a member was in crisis, seeking guidance and comfort from me, Sister Maria, as soon as possible. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the crisp, pressed shirt of the operator and the simple, flowing habit of the nun. The world expected me to be diligent, to improve my skills for the safety of thousands, but also to be present, compassionate, and spiritually available. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart torn between duty to my passengers and my calling to serve those in spiritual need."}
