The customer had messaged, asking if I could wait a few extra minutes since they were running late. I knew the company expected me to secure every delivery, especially for items like this, and to get that signature no matter what. But my mind kept drifting to home, to the small altar in my living room. Sunset was approaching, and I hadn\u2019t yet lit the lamp or offered my prayers. Every evening, I set aside this time to honor my faith, to feel grounded and connected. If I waited for the customer, I\u2019d miss the sacred window for my ritual. If I left the package, I\u2019d be breaking company policy and risking my job. My phone buzzed again\u2014the customer was still ten minutes away. I stood on the porch, package in hand, heart pounding, torn between my duty as a delivery person and my devotion as a Hindu."}
