My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cKeep the site safe and clean, always.\u201d I knew if anyone slipped, it would be on me. I grabbed the mop and bucket, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a reminder: Sister Maria would be arriving at the chapel in ten minutes. She\u2019d confided in me last week, her voice trembling, about her ongoing battle with depression. As her priest, I promised to be there, to listen, to offer comfort and guidance. My heart pounded. If I left the spill, someone could get hurt. If I missed my appointment, I\u2019d let Maria down when she needed me most. The mop handle felt heavy in my hand, my collar tight around my neck. I stood frozen, torn between my duty to protect my coworkers and my calling to care for my flock, the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
