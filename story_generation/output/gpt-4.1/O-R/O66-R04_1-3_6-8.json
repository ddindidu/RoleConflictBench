As a taxi driver, I took pride in keeping my car immaculate\u2014my passengers expected a clean, comfortable ride, and I never wanted to disappoint. Just as I finished, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque: someone had arrived, desperate for guidance after a devastating loss. As the imam, I knew my community counted on me to be present, to listen, to offer comfort in their darkest moments. I glanced at the clock\u2014my next passenger would arrive any minute, and I couldn\u2019t just leave the cab unattended or risk a bad review. But the thought of someone sitting alone in the mosque, heartbroken and waiting for me, gnawed at my conscience. My hands trembled as I weighed the responsibility of my livelihood against the duty of my faith. The pressure of both worlds pressed in, and I stood frozen, keys in one hand, prayer beads in the other, torn between two lives that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
