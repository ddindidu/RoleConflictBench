The new feature is almost done, but the code review pings keep coming\u2014warnings about performance, suggestions for cleaner logic. My team expects me to deliver code that\u2019s not just functional, but elegant and efficient. I know if I leave it as is, I\u2019ll be letting them down, maybe even risking a bug slipping through. \n\nBut my phone vibrates with a gentle reminder: the evening chant at the temple starts in fifteen minutes. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to be there, to join the community in ritual and reflection. It\u2019s not just about showing up; it\u2019s about being present, supporting others, and nurturing my own practice. \n\nMy mind tugs in two directions. If I stay, I betray my commitment to the sangha. If I go, I let my team down and leave my work unfinished. The tension knots in my chest, a silent struggle between the demands of code and the call of the bell."}
