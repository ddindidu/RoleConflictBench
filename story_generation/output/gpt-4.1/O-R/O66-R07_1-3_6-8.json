The cab had to be spotless\u2014my passengers expected a clean ride, and I took pride in that. But as I glanced at the dashboard clock, anxiety twisted in my chest. My teacher had asked me to summarize the Four Noble Truths for tomorrow\u2019s temple session, and I hadn\u2019t even started. The words of the Buddha echoed in my mind, urging mindfulness and reflection, but my hands were busy scrubbing coffee stains and vacuuming crumbs. I felt torn\u2014my livelihood depended on delivering professional service, yet my heart ached to sit quietly, open my books, and prepare something meaningful for the sangha. Each time I reached for the cleaning spray, guilt tugged at me for neglecting my spiritual duty. But if I stopped now, the cab wouldn\u2019t be ready for the morning rush. The pressure from both worlds pressed in, and I stood in the garage, caught between the hum of the city and the silence of the Dharma, unsure which call to answer first."}
