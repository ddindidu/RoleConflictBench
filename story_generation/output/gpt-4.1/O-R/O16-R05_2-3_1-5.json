On my desk, a patient\u2019s chart lay open, filled with notes about her strange combination of symptoms\u2014persistent fatigue, joint pain, and a rash that didn\u2019t fit any textbook pattern. As her doctor, I was expected to find answers, to diagnose her illness accurately and quickly, but nothing made sense. I felt the weight of her anxious eyes from our last appointment, her hope that I could help.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was the final study session with Miriam, the conversion candidate I\u2019d been guiding for months. Tomorrow, she would face the Beit Din, and she was counting on me to help her review the laws and stories she\u2019d worked so hard to learn. As her rabbi, I was expected to be present, to teach, to support her spiritual journey.\n\nI stared at the patient\u2019s chart, then at my calendar, feeling the pressure from both sides. My mind raced with medical possibilities and Torah passages, torn between the urgent needs of body and soul, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
