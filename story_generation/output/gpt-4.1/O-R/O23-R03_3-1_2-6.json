My Bible lay open, inviting me into the quiet depths of spiritual reflection I had longed for all week. Yet, beside it, a thick stack of legal documents demanded my attention\u2014pages of a merger contract, dense with clauses that could spell disaster for my client if I missed a single detail. The law firm expected my analysis by evening; the client\u2019s financial future might hinge on my review. But the convent expected my presence in spirit, my mind and heart turned toward God, not legalese. My hands trembled as I reached for the contract, guilt prickling at the edges of my conscience. Was I neglecting my sacred duty for my professional one, or vice versa? The silence of the room pressed in, heavy with the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
