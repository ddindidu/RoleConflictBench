It was a little high, but not alarming\u2014still, I knew I should keep an eye on her. The ward was busy, and I was already behind on my rounds. My supervisor expected every vital sign to be logged promptly and accurately, no exceptions. Yet, my mind kept drifting to the temple. My teacher had asked me to summarize the Heart Sutra for tomorrow\u2019s session, a task that required quiet reflection and careful thought. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the hospital\u2019s relentless pace, the beeping monitors, the expectation to be vigilant and efficient; and the gentle, persistent call of my Buddhist practice, urging me to slow down, to contemplate, to prepare something meaningful for my sangha. I stood in the hallway, torn, the hum of fluorescent lights above me, my heart pulled in two directions, unsure which duty to answer first."}
