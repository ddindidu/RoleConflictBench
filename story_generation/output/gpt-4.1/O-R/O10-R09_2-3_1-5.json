The month-end deadline loomed, and as the accountant, I was expected to finalize the books with absolute accuracy. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need this done tonight, no exceptions.\u201d The communal dinner was meant to keep us fueled, but as the trays arrived, I scanned the labels and saw no kosher certification. My stomach tightened. As a Jew, I was expected to observe kosher dietary laws, and I knew my family would expect nothing less. But the food was all there was, and everyone else was already digging in, chatting and laughing, expecting me to join. My colleagues glanced over, waiting for me to take a plate and keep working. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my professional duty to stay and finish the books, and my religious commitment to keep kosher. My hands hovered over the food, my mind racing, caught between the demands of my job and the expectations of my faith."}
