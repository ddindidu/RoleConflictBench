As a cashier, I know I\u2019m expected to greet every customer with a smile, keep the line moving, and handle each transaction with care. My manager glances over, reminding me with a nod to stay cheerful, even as my feet ache and my mind races. I do my best, chatting with customers, making small talk, and apologizing for the wait. \n\nBut as the clock ticks closer to the end of my shift, my thoughts drift to the Quran resting on my nightstand at home. As a Muslim, I\u2019ve promised myself to spend this evening reciting and reflecting, something I\u2019ve neglected all week. The anticipation of spiritual peace tugs at me, but so does the pressure to keep up my friendly facade for the last few customers. I feel torn, caught between the demands of my job and the longing for quiet devotion. The line inches forward, and I force another smile, my heart wrestling with the roles I must play."}
