Still, protocol demanded I monitor her closely and report any changes. My mind was already half at the mosque, where I was scheduled to lead the afternoon prayer and offer guidance. Just as I was about to check Mrs. Rahman\u2019s temperature again, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque: a young man had arrived, devastated by the sudden loss of his father, and was asking for me specifically. My heart clenched. As a nursing assistant, I knew I couldn\u2019t leave my patient unattended, especially with her condition. But as an imam, I felt a deep responsibility to comfort someone in spiritual crisis. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding my presence for physical care, the other for emotional and spiritual support. I stood in the hallway, torn, feeling the expectations of both worlds pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which duty to answer first."}
