As a cashier, I know I\u2019m expected to keep things moving, smile, and make each person feel welcome. I greet Mrs. Lee, who fumbles with her coupons, and I remind myself to stay friendly, even as the line grows longer and the manager glances over, urging me to speed up.\n\nThen I spot Mr. Carter, a regular from my congregation, standing off to the side. He looks tired, his shoulders slumped. I remember the message his wife left at the church\u2014he\u2019s been struggling since losing his job. As a pastor, I should step away, offer him a listening ear, maybe a prayer. But the customers are restless, and my supervisor expects efficiency. My heart aches with the pull between my duty to serve these shoppers and my calling to care for my flock. I grip the register, torn, as the next customer steps forward and Mr. Carter waits, hope flickering in his eyes."}
