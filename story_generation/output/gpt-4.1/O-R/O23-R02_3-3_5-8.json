My client\u2019s future depended on my presence in court; the judge had made it clear\u2014no delays, no excuses. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from the parish: the Martinez family needed me to lead their child\u2019s final sacrament preparation. The session was non-negotiable, the culmination of months of spiritual guidance, and the family\u2019s faith rested on my commitment. I could picture the hopeful faces of the children, the trust in their parents\u2019 eyes. But I also saw my client, anxious and counting on my advocacy. Both roles demanded my full presence, both were urgent, and both were, impossibly, scheduled for the same time. My heart pounded as I weighed the sacred against the sworn, the courtroom against the sanctuary, feeling the expectations of two worlds pulling me apart."}
