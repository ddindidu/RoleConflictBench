The automated compliance system tracks every second\u2014if I step away outside my scheduled break, it\u2019s flagged. I need this job, especially now, when every paycheck matters. But as I listen to the hum of voices around me, my mind drifts to the fifth pillar of my faith: Hajj. My parents remind me gently, \u201cIt\u2019s a duty, once in a lifetime, if you can afford it.\u201d I want to go, to stand in the holy city, to fulfill what\u2019s expected of me as a Muslim. But the cost is daunting, and I\u2019m just starting out. Each time I think about saving, I remember the pressure at work\u2014no overtime, no unscheduled breaks, every minute accounted for. I feel torn, the weight of religious obligation pressing against the rigid structure of my job. My heart aches with the desire to fulfill my faith, but my reality is a spreadsheet of hours and warnings. I stare at the blinking cursor, caught between the demands of my faith and the rules of my workplace, unsure which path to take."}
