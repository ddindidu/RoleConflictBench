The foreman\u2019s voice echoes, \u201cEvacuate! Muster point, now!\u201d I join the stream of workers, sweat-soaked and dusty in my high-vis vest and work pants. My mind races ahead to the office function this afternoon\u2014everyone from the site and the office, men and women, all together. I\u2019m expected to show up, to be part of the team, to blend in and not make a fuss. But I also know I must dress modestly, as my faith requires, even if it means standing out. I picture the curious glances, the awkward questions, the silent judgment. The pressure to fit in with my coworkers clashes with the quiet certainty of my beliefs. As I walk toward the muster point, I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding something different, and I wonder how I can possibly satisfy them both."}
