The call volume was unusually light today, and my supervisor had mentioned we could be flexible with our breaks. I felt a rare sense of freedom, a small window in my otherwise regimented workday. But as I prepared to log out, my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes: a parishioner was waiting in the chapel, desperate to talk about a crisis of faith. As a nun, I knew the importance of being present for those in spiritual need, especially when someone reached out in such vulnerability. Yet, the telemarketer in me hesitated\u2014my break was meant for rest, not for more emotional labor. I was expected to use this time to recharge, not to counsel. The two worlds collided inside me: the structured, measured world of call quotas and break schedules, and the open, compassionate world of spiritual care. My heart ached with the weight of both expectations, torn between the quiet sanctuary and the humming office, unsure which path to take as I stood at the threshold of my break."}
