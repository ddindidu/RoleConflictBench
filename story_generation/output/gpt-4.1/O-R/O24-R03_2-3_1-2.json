As a judge, I knew the weight of my responsibility\u2014every detail mattered, every argument needed careful consideration. The outcome would affect lives, and I owed it to the law, and to justice, to be thorough. Yet, my phone buzzed with urgent messages from the convent. The hurricane had devastated our town, and the mayor was pleading for help. As a nun, I was expected to lead the relief effort, to comfort the displaced, to serve with compassion and presence. My sisters were already at the shelter, overwhelmed. I felt the pull of both worlds\u2014one demanding my mind, the other my heart and hands. Guilt gnawed at me as I tried to focus on the legal arguments, but the faces of those in need haunted me. I closed my eyes, torn between the silent call of justice and the desperate cries for mercy, knowing I could not give both all they deserved."}
