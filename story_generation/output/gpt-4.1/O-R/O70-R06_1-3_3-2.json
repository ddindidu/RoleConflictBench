The instructions were clear: leave the box at the doorstep and snap a photo for proof. No one answered when I rang the bell, so I set the package down, ready to move on. But as I turned to leave, I noticed the door was slightly ajar. Through the crack, I could see a wallet lying just inside, bills peeking out. My job was to secure the delivery, not get involved. But as a Christian, I felt a tug in my heart\u2014what if someone took advantage of this open door? What if the homeowner was in trouble? I stood there, torn between the company\u2019s rule to never enter a customer\u2019s home and my own conviction to help and protect others. My phone buzzed with the next delivery, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the uneasy feeling growing inside me."}
