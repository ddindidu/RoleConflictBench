I\u2019ve heard rumors.\u201d My mind raced\u2014confidentiality was non-negotiable, but the pressure to fit in, to share just enough to be part of the group, gnawed at me. I smiled politely, deflecting, but the question lingered in the air.\n\nLater that evening, I returned home to find my son hunched over his Torah portion, frustration etched on his face. His bar mitzvah was weeks away, and he still stumbled over the Hebrew. As a parent and a Jew, I felt the weight of tradition pressing on me\u2014the expectation to guide him, to ensure he understood not just the words, but their meaning.
