A quick inspection confirmed my fear: it was malfunctioning, and if left unchecked, it could put swimmers at risk. I knew I had to act fast\u2014maintenance needed to be called, and the area secured. But as I glanced at my watch, I realized it was almost time for Friday prayers. I was still in my lifeguard uniform, which didn\u2019t meet the modest dress required for entering the main prayer hall. The expectation to maintain safety at the pool pressed on me, but so did my responsibility to observe my faith and dress appropriately for worship. My heart pounded as I stood at the crossroads, torn between the urgent duty to protect others and the deep commitment to my religious practice."}
