The supervisor\u2019s sudden entrance made my heart race\u2014her clipboard ready, eyes sharp, every move of mine under scrutiny. I knew the protocols by heart, but the pressure to perform flawlessly in this surprise audit was suffocating. My mind, however, kept drifting to the convent. The Mother Superior\u2019s request echoed in my thoughts: lead the daily reflections for the retreat, guide the sisters in spiritual study. I was expected to be a pillar of calm wisdom, to prepare meditations that would nourish their souls. Yet here I was, forced to focus on every technical detail, every announcement, every stop. I felt torn\u2014how could I be fully present for my sisters when my mind was consumed by the demands of this audit? The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each expecting my undivided devotion, and I sat there, caught between the rails and the silence of prayer, unsure which part of me would have to wait."}
