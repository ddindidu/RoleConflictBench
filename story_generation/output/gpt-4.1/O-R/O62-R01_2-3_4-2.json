As the lifeguard, I knew I was responsible for keeping the equipment in top shape\u2014if I didn\u2019t fix it now, the lessons would be disrupted, and someone could get hurt. I grabbed the repair kit, but before I could start, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was waiting in my office, desperate for guidance about a decision that could change her life. As her pastor, I knew she needed me to listen, to offer comfort and wisdom in her moment of crisis. I stood at the edge of the pool, torn between the urgent, practical need to fix the rope and the deep, spiritual responsibility to be present for Sarah. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, forcing me to choose which part of myself to honor first."}
