The cleaning cart was ready, and the checklist from the supervisor was clear: every surface must be sanitized, every protocol followed. I knew the rules\u2014no shortcuts, not even for a moment. But my phone buzzed with a message from Miriam, the conversion candidate. Her final study session before the Beit Din was in ten minutes, and she was anxious, needing reassurance and last-minute guidance. As her rabbi, I was expected to be present, to teach, to calm her fears and help her prepare for this life-changing moment. Yet, as the cleaner, I was expected to finish disinfecting the classrooms before the next group arrived, with no exceptions. My heart pounded as I stared at the mop in my hand, torn between the sacred duty to my faith and the strict demands of my job. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, and I felt the impossible pull of two worlds, each demanding all of me, right now."}
