She was a regular, an elderly woman with a gentle smile, and today her doctor had added a new medication to her already complex regimen. As a pharmacist, I knew the importance of accuracy\u2014one mistake could harm her fragile health. My mind raced through the drug interactions, the dosages, the instructions I needed to explain. But as I glanced up, I saw Mrs. Lee waiting, her hands trembling, her eyes tired. She looked like she needed more than just pills; she needed comfort, reassurance, maybe even a prayer.\n\nAs a Christian, I felt the pull to show her kindness, to step out from behind the counter, offer a gentle word, or hold her hand. But the line was growing, and my professional duty demanded focus and efficiency. I felt torn\u2014should I pause my careful checking to offer her a moment of compassion, or should I keep my attention fixed on the prescription, ensuring her safety above all? The expectations of my faith and my profession pressed in on me, and I stood there, heart pounding, caught between two worlds."}
