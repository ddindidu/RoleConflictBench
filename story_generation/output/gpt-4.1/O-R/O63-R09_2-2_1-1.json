The script blinks in front of me, but the customer\u2019s questions quickly veer into technical details I barely understand. My manager expects me to keep them engaged, handle objections, and never say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I fumble for answers, feeling the pressure to sound confident, to keep the call alive. But my mind keeps drifting to the kitchen table at home, where my children wait for me to teach them the blessings for the upcoming holiday. The festival is only days away, and they still stumble over the words, their voices uncertain. I promised myself I\u2019d pass on these traditions, that I\u2019d make time to teach them what my parents taught me. But every evening, I\u2019m exhausted from work, and now, with overtime looming, I wonder how I can possibly do both. The phone rings again, and I force a smile into my voice, but inside, I\u2019m torn\u2014pulled between the demands of my job and the responsibility I feel to my family and my faith."}
