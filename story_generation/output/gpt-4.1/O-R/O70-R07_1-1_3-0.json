My delivery route was running late, and the last stop was a quiet house at the edge of town. No one answered the doorbell, and I remembered the instructions: leave the package only if it\u2019s safe. I scanned the porch, noticing a stray dog nearby and a forecast of rain. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the evening chant at the temple. As a Buddhist, I was expected to arrive early, help set up, and join the community in reciting sutras. The thought of missing the ritual filled me with guilt; it was a time for reflection and connection, something I cherished. But my job demanded I secure this delivery, confirm it was received, and not just abandon it to chance. I stood on the porch, package in hand, torn between my duty to my customers and my commitment to my spiritual community, feeling the tension knot in my chest as the sun dipped lower behind the trees."}
