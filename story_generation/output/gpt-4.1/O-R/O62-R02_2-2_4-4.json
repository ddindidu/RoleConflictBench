As I walked the deck, my eyes caught on a frayed lane rope, its fibers split and tangled. Swim lessons would start in less than an hour, and if the rope wasn\u2019t fixed, the class would be chaotic\u2014unsafe, even. I knew it was my responsibility as a lifeguard to keep everything in order, to ensure the safety and smooth running of the facility. I knelt to inspect the damage, already planning how I\u2019d repair it.\n\nBut my phone buzzed. A reminder flashed: \u201c10:00 AM\u2014counseling with Mrs. Evans.\u201d She\u2019d reached out last night, her voice trembling, desperate for guidance. As her priest, I\u2019d promised to be there, to listen and help her find peace. I felt the weight of her trust, the sacred duty to offer comfort.\n\nI stood, torn between two worlds. The pool needed me\u2014children\u2019s safety depended on it. But Mrs. Evans needed me too, her soul in turmoil. My heart pounded as I stared at the broken rope, the minutes ticking away, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
