My heart pounded\u2014I knew the shade wasn\u2019t quite what she\u2019d hoped for. As a hairdresser, I was expected to fix this, to reassure her, to make it right. But just as I opened my mouth to address her concern, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the community gathering was about to start, and I was scheduled to share a religious story, to teach and inspire as their pastor. I could picture the expectant faces waiting for me, counting on my words to guide them. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding immediate, practical care, the other calling for spiritual leadership. I felt torn, my mind racing with the need to be present in two places, to meet two very different sets of expectations. My hands trembled slightly as I tried to decide what to do next."}
