The roads were clear, the morning sun just beginning to warm the city. I had one more passenger to drop off before I could return to the convent. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. The chapel bell would ring in ten minutes, calling all the sisters to morning prayer. As a nun, I was expected to be present, kneeling in the pews, joining my sisters in devotion. But as a taxi driver, I was responsible for my passenger\u2019s safety, for obeying every traffic law, for not rushing or cutting corners. The urge to speed up, to shave off a few minutes, gnawed at me. I could make it if I pushed the limits, but that would mean risking a ticket\u2014or worse, an accident. My heart pounded with the weight of both vows: to serve faithfully in the world, and to serve faithfully in the chapel. The light turned green, and I hesitated, torn between the road ahead and the sanctuary waiting for me."}
