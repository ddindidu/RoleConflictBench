It\u2019s not the full morning puja my family expects, but it\u2019s what I can manage between shifts. The intercom crackles, and a passenger\u2019s voice cuts through my concentration, asking for directions to a transfer line. I know my duty: every passenger\u2019s safety and comfort is my responsibility. But as I reach for the microphone, I feel the familiar tug inside me\u2014my mantra interrupted, my connection to the divine slipping away for a moment. I want to honor my faith, to keep the sacred words flowing, but the demands of my job are immediate and public. My hands hover, my mind split, the weight of both roles pressing in. I can\u2019t ignore the passenger, but I can\u2019t ignore the quiet promise I made to myself and my faith either."}
