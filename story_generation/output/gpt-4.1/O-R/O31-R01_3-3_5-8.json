Dispatch reported a violent assault just blocks away\u2014bystanders at risk, the situation escalating. As a police officer, I knew my duty: protect lives, intervene immediately. But as a pastor, I was the anchor for these leaders, responsible for shepherding them through a rare, intensive session they\u2019d been preparing for months. Their eyes were on me, expecting wisdom and presence, while my badge demanded swift action and courage. My heart pounded with the weight of both callings. Could I abandon my flock in their moment of need? Could I ignore the cries for help echoing through the city? The expectations pressed in from both sides, each role demanding my full self, and I stood frozen, torn between the pulpit and the siren."}
