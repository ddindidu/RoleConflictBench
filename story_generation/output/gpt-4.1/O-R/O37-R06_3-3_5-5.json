Mrs. Johnson expects everything spotless, and I know she\u2019ll be upset if I don\u2019t finish the job perfectly. I checked the supply closet twice, hoping I\u2019d missed a bottle, but it was empty. The only way to get more would be to run to the store, but that would mean missing the start of Sunday service. My church family counts on me to help set up chairs and greet newcomers. I could feel the weight of both responsibilities pressing on me\u2014Mrs. Johnson\u2019s high standards and my commitment to my faith and community. My heart ached as I stood in the kitchen, torn between being the reliable cleaner my client expects and the devoted Christian my church needs. I stared at the empty shelf, wrestling with what to do next."}
