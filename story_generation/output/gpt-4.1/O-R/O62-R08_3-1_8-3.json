My phone buzzed: the community pool was short-staffed, and they needed me to fill in as a lifeguard. I rushed over, still in my modest attire, not having time to change into the standard lifeguard uniform. \n\nAs I scanned the pool, I spotted a child flailing in the deep end, a place strictly off-limits for non-swimmers. My training screamed at me to act fast, to enforce the safety rules and save the child. But I hesitated, feeling the weight of eyes on me\u2014my modest clothes clinging awkwardly, not designed for swimming, and certainly not what the pool expected from a lifeguard. I felt torn between my duty to save a life and my commitment to dress modestly, both roles demanding something different from me in this urgent moment. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I could bear to break."}
