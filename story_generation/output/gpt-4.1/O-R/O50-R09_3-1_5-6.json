I knew what it meant\u2014a breakdown was imminent, and if I didn\u2019t act fast, the whole line could grind to a halt. My hands itched to grab my tools, to get inside the machine and clean out the grime, replace the part, and restore the steady hum that meant everything was running as it should. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. It was almost time for the synagogue service, the one I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss again. My community expected me there, to pray, to be present, to uphold the rhythm of our faith. I could picture the familiar faces, the gentle nods, the comfort of shared words. Yet here I was, torn between the urgent call of the machine and the quiet pull of my tradition. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, caught between the screeching metal and the silent sanctuary, unsure which demand I could bear to let down."}
