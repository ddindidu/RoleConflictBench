My client\u2019s future hangs in the balance, and I know I must be at my sharpest\u2014every argument, every objection, every detail matters. The judge has made it clear: no delays, no excuses.

My children\u2019s eager faces come to mind, their questions about the Seder, the blessings, the story of our people\u2019s freedom. I promised them we\u2019d practice together, that I\u2019d teach them the melodies and meanings, just as my parents did for me. The weight of both worlds presses on my chest.

I feel torn, knowing that whichever path I choose, something precious will be left wanting."}
