The store manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cEvery cent must be accounted for, no shortcuts.\u201d The corporate policy was clear\u2014no matter how late, the deposit had to be perfect, the paperwork flawless. But my phone buzzed again, a reminder of the workshop I\u2019d spent weeks preparing for. As a pastor, I was expected to guide our community leaders through the intricacies of faith, to be present, focused, and ready to answer their questions. They were gathering now, waiting for me to help them wrestle with the deeper meanings of our beliefs.

I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down, each expecting my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
