The woman in my chair, a first-time visitor, peered into the mirror and frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit too brassy,\u201d she said quietly, her disappointment clear. I felt a familiar knot tighten in my stomach. As a hairdresser, I knew I needed to address her concern, reassure her, maybe even redo the colour\u2014client satisfaction was everything. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the service was in two hours, and I still hadn\u2019t finalized my sermon. The congregation would be waiting, expecting inspiration and guidance from their rabbi, especially on such an important day. I could see both worlds pulling at me\u2014one demanding patience and presence, the other urgency and spiritual leadership. My hands trembled slightly as I reached for the toner, my mind torn between the woman\u2019s anxious eyes and the weight of the words I had yet to write."}
