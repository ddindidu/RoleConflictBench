He winced with every movement, and I could see how much he depended on my steady hands and calm words. My mind was focused on his comfort, making sure I didn\u2019t rush, that I listened to his needs. Just as I was helping him with his shirt, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Maria, a member of my congregation. She wrote that her son had run away again, and she needed to talk\u2014right now. I could almost hear the desperation in her words. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: Mr. Jenkins needed my undivided attention and gentle care, but Maria was reaching out for spiritual support, expecting me to be present for her in her crisis. My heart raced as I tried to figure out how to be what both of them needed, feeling the pull of duty and compassion tearing me in two directions."}
