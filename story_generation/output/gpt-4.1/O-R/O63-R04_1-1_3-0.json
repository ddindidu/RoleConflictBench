Maghrib is approaching, and as the imam, I\u2019m expected to lead the prayer at the mosque. The congregation is small tonight, and Brother Yusuf, who is more than capable, is already there, ready to step in if needed. My phone buzzes with another potential client\u2019s number, and I know that every call now is just icing on the cake, a chance to really stand out at work. But the thought of missing my duty at the mosque tugs at me. The community expects me to be present, to guide them, even if just a handful gather. My heart pounds as I weigh the satisfaction of exceeding my sales goals against the quiet responsibility of spiritual leadership.
