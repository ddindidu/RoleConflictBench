The product team had scheduled a general brainstorming session for the next sprint, and while attendance was technically optional, I knew how much it meant to my manager that I show up and contribute. We were supposed to collaborate with other teams, share ideas, and help shape the new features. I could already imagine the subtle disappointment if I didn\u2019t attend, the missed opportunity to have my voice heard.\n\nBut then, Sister Agnes had fallen ill, and the convent was holding a special healing service for her\u2014outside our usual prayer schedule. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to pray with the community, to offer comfort and solidarity. The sisters would notice my absence, and I would feel the weight of letting them down, of not living up to my vows.\n\nMy heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides. I felt torn, caught between my commitment to my team and my devotion to my sisters. I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
