The label was clear: urgent, for the cardiac unit. I knew the consequences if I was late\u2014lives could depend on this delivery. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I saw a message from the mosque: someone was waiting for me, desperate for guidance. I remembered the man\u2019s face, red-eyed and trembling, clutching his prayer beads, his world just shattered by loss. As an imam, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and wisdom in moments like this. But as a delivery person, I was expected to be reliable, to never let a package arrive late, especially not one so critical. My heart pounded as I stood at the hospital entrance, torn between the urgent needs of a patient I\u2019d never meet and the pain of a grieving soul who needed me now. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between two worlds that demanded all of me at the same time."}
