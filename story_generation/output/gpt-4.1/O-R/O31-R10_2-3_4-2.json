As a police officer, my duty was clear: protect the citizens, keep the scene safe, and direct the anxious drivers around the twisted metal of the accident. My radio crackled with updates, and I could see the fear and confusion in the eyes of those involved. Every instinct told me to stay focused, to be present, to serve.\n\nBut as the minutes ticked by, my mind drifted to my other life\u2014the one that began before dawn, with incense and mantras. As a Hindu, my daily rituals are not just tradition; they are a lifeline, a promise to the divine that I will honor each moment with devotion. The time for my morning prayers was slipping away, and with it, the peace I find in their rhythm. I felt the weight of my uniform and the pull of my faith, each demanding my full attention. My heart pounded with the pressure of choosing: to serve my community or to serve my soul."}
