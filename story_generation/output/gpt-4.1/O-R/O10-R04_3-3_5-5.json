It was from the tax authority\u2014a notice of discrepancy, flagged as urgent. My heart thudded. As the accountant, I knew the rules: respond immediately, provide documentation, avoid penalties. The deadline was today. I reached for the files, but my phone buzzed again. A reminder: today was the special Friday sermon. Families from neighboring towns had arrived, eager to hear my words as their imam. The community expected guidance, inspiration, and a celebration of our shared milestone. I glanced at the clock. The window to address the tax issue was closing, but so was the time to prepare my sermon. My mind raced, torn between the duty to uphold financial integrity and the spiritual responsibility to my congregation. Both roles demanded my full presence, but I could not be in two places at once. The weight of expectation pressed on my chest as I stared at the blinking cursor and the waiting congregation, uncertain which path to take."}
