The phone rang, and another prospect launched into a barrage of technical questions\u2014details the script only skimmed. My supervisor expected me to handle objections smoothly, keep the call moving, and close the sale. But I could feel my mind drifting to the sermon I needed to prepare for the High Holiday service. The congregation would be there, waiting for words of inspiration and guidance. I was supposed to offer wisdom, to be present, thoughtful, and prepared. Yet here I was, fumbling through half-answers, my thoughts split between the customer\u2019s questions and the Torah portion I hadn\u2019t even started outlining. Each call left me more anxious, knowing that every minute spent here was a minute lost from the sermon. My heart pounded as I tried to focus, torn between the demands of my job and the expectations of my community, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, waiting for me to choose which to serve first."}
