I smiled warmly, ushering them to their seats, offering tea, and assuring them everything would run on time. My hands moved swiftly, curling and pinning hair, but my mind kept drifting. Tonight, the community Quran study circle would gather, and I was expected to have read and reflected on the verses assigned. I hadn\u2019t found a quiet moment all week. The bride\u2019s mother asked for reassurance, and I gave it, but inside, guilt gnawed at me. My clients needed my full attention and calm presence, but my heart tugged toward my faith, knowing I\u2019d be unprepared for the discussion. The clock ticked, the salon filled with chatter, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding more than I could give."}
