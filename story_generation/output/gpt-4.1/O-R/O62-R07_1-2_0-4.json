As a lifeguard, I know I\u2019m expected to watch every swimmer, every moment\u2014no exceptions. A few kids drift toward the deep end, but they\u2019re laughing, splashing, not in trouble. Still, I can\u2019t look away, can\u2019t let my guard down. Yet, today is the weekly group meditation, the one hour I dedicate to my Buddhist practice. My teacher always says, \u201cBe present, let go of distractions.\u201d I crave that stillness, the gentle rhythm of breath, the peace that comes from turning inward. But how can I close my eyes, even for a moment, when I\u2019m responsible for these lives? My mind tugs in two directions: the duty to protect, the longing to be mindful. I feel the tension coil in my chest, the weight of both roles pressing down. The pool glimmers in the afternoon sun, and I sit, torn, unable to choose."}
