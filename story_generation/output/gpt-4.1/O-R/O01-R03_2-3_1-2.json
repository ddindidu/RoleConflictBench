The new community center\u2019s design was beautiful, but as I traced the lines, my heart tightened. The support beams in the main hall weren\u2019t up to code\u2014if left uncorrected, they could fail. As an architect, I knew I had to halt construction and demand changes, no matter the cost or delay. Safety and compliance were non-negotiable.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again. The mayor\u2019s voice, urgent and pleading, echoed in my mind: \u201cSister, we need you. The hurricane\u2019s left so many without homes. Please, help us organize the relief effort.\u201d As a nun, I was expected to serve, to be present for those in need, to comfort and lead. The sisters were already gathering supplies, and the community looked to me for guidance.\n\nI stared at the blueprints, then at the phone, feeling pulled in two directions. My duty to protect lives through my work as an architect clashed with my calling to serve as a nun. Both roles demanded my full attention, but I could not be in two places at once. My heart ached as I wrestled with what to do next."}
