The package on the seat beside me was marked \u201cCONFIDENTIAL\u2014HAND DELIVERY ONLY.\u201d I was supposed to deliver it directly to the recipient, check their ID, and get a signature. My phone buzzed with a message from the parish secretary: \u201cThe Martinez family is waiting. Their son\u2019s sacrament is this weekend. They need you for the final prep session\u2014today, please.\u201d I felt my stomach twist. The family had been anxious, wanting reassurance and guidance before their child\u2019s big day. I knew how much this meant to them, and as their priest, I was expected to be present, patient, and prepared. But the delivery company was clear: no delays, no shortcuts, especially with high-value packages. I could picture the recipient waiting, maybe needing this delivery for something urgent. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent, and both would be let down if I chose the other. I sat at the intersection, heart pounding, torn between duty and devotion, unable to move."}
