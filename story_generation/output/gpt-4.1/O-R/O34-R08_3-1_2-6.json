A sudden route closure had thrown the airspace into chaos, and my headset buzzed with urgent voices\u2014pilots needing instructions, supervisors demanding updates. My hands moved quickly, assigning altitudes, calculating safe distances, feeling the weight of hundreds of lives in every decision. I was proud of my job, proud to keep the skies safe, but as I glanced at the clock, a familiar ache tugged at me. \n\nIt was Hajj season.
