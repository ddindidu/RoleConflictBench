My passenger, a nervous businessman, kept glancing at his watch and muttering about missing his flight. He pleaded with me to go faster, to find a shortcut, to do anything to get him to the airport on time. I felt the weight of his urgency pressing on me, the expectation that I would deliver him safely and swiftly despite the treacherous conditions. But as I glanced at the dashboard clock, my heart twisted. In less than an hour, I was supposed to be at the church, leading the children\u2019s religious education class. Parents and kids would be waiting, expecting guidance, warmth, and a lesson that I had carefully prepared. I could already imagine the disappointment if I didn\u2019t show up, the questions about my commitment to the parish. The storm outside was nothing compared to the storm inside me\u2014torn between the duty to my passenger and the responsibility to my congregation, I felt paralyzed, unable to choose which promise to break."}
