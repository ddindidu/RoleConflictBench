My next appointment, a regular who always came straight from the gym, was already waiting. Her hair was damp with sweat, sticking to her forehead, and I knew she expected the usual wash and condition before her cut. I could smell the faint tang of sweat and see the grease clinging to her roots. As a hairdresser, it was my job to make her feel fresh and cared for, no matter what state she arrived in.\n\nBut tonight was also the midweek church service, and I\u2019d promised the pastor I\u2019d help set up for the community dinner. The service started in less than an hour, and I was already running late. My church family counted on me to be there, to worship and serve alongside them. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing on my chest.\n\nI stood at the shampoo station, torn. If I rushed the wash, I\u2019d be letting down my client. If I took my time, I\u2019d miss church and disappoint my community. My hands trembled as I reached for the shampoo, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I\u2019d have to let down tonight."}
