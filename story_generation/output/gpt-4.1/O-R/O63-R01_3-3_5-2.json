The sales manager\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cWe need three more conversions, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d My screen flashes with numbers, names, and scripts, but my phone vibrates with a different urgency\u2014a text from a church member, desperate for guidance. She\u2019s in crisis, her message trembling with fear and confusion, and she needs me now. I glance at the clock, feeling the pressure of the sales target, the livelihoods of my team hanging in the balance. But as a pastor, I know my calling is to listen, to offer comfort and wisdom, especially when someone\u2019s soul is at stake. My heart pounds as I stare at the phone, torn between dialing the next prospect and calling her back. The demands of both worlds press in, each expecting my full devotion, and I sit frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice between duty and compassion."}
