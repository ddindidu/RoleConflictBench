The call volume was unusually light today, and my supervisor had just announced we could take our breaks whenever we wanted, as long as we logged out properly. I was about to log out when a call came through. The customer sounded desperate, her voice trembling as she explained she\u2019d lost her job and couldn\u2019t afford the product I was supposed to upsell. My training as a telemarketer told me to stick to the script, to gently push the sale, and to keep my break schedule flexible as long as I met my targets. But as a Christian, I felt a deep ache in my chest. I knew I was called to show compassion, to help those in need, not to pressure them for a commission. My mind raced with conflicting thoughts\u2014should I follow the company\u2019s expectations and try to make the sale, or should I listen to my conscience and offer her understanding instead? The seconds ticked by, my finger hovering over the \u201cend call\u201d button, my heart torn between my job and my faith."}
