The calls today were easy\u2014most people listened politely, and the few questions they asked were ones I\u2019d answered a hundred times before. I felt myself slipping into the rhythm, my voice warm and persuasive, my mind half on autopilot. But as I glanced at the clock, my stomach tightened. In less than an hour, I was supposed to be at the parish hall, leading the planning meeting for our adult faith formation series. The committee expected me to bring fresh ideas, to inspire and organize, to be fully present as their priest.\n\nYet here I was, tethered to my desk by the demands of my other job, each call a reminder of the quota I needed to meet. I could feel the expectations pulling me in opposite directions: the company needed my numbers, the church needed my guidance. My heart pounded as I weighed the consequences of letting either side down, the script blurring before my eyes as I wrestled with what to do next."}
