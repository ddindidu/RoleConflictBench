My phone buzzed with messages from the project manager\u2014everyone was waiting on me. The entire build was stalled, and the pressure to deliver was suffocating. I knew the team was counting on me to solve this technical bottleneck, to keep the project on track. Just as I was about to dive back into the code, the church door creaked open. A woman entered, her face streaked with tears, her hands trembling. She barely managed to say, \u201cFather, please, I need help. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Her pain was raw, urgent, and I could see she needed someone to listen, to guide her through her crisis. My mind raced\u2014my congregation expected compassion and presence, but my colleagues needed my technical expertise, now. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. I stood frozen, caught between the demands of faith and function, unable to move."}
