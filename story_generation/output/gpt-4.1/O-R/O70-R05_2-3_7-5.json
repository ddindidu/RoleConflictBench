I glanced at the screen: a customer, impatient, asking where their package was. As a delivery person, I knew I had to respond quickly and politely, reassure them, maybe even check the tracking details. But inside, I could hear the nervous shuffling of the conversion candidate waiting for me. This was their final study session before the Beit Din, the culmination of months of learning. As their rabbi, I was expected to be fully present, to guide them through the last questions, to offer wisdom and calm. My mind raced\u2014if I ignored the customer, I risked a complaint and maybe even my job. If I delayed the study session, I might shake the candidate\u2019s confidence at the most crucial moment. I stood in the hallway, phone in hand, heart pounding, feeling the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me."}
