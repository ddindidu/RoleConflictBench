I greeted her warmly, ushering her to my chair, already bracing myself for the challenge ahead. The buildup in her hair was so thick, my fingers snagged in the tangles as I tried to work in the shampoo. I knew I needed to take my time, to gently detangle and condition before I could even think about cutting. But as I massaged her scalp, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Mark, a member of my congregation. He was waiting in the church office next door, desperate for guidance about a life-altering decision. My heart squeezed. As a hairdresser, I couldn\u2019t rush this process without risking damage to Mrs. Carter\u2019s hair. As a pastor, I couldn\u2019t ignore someone in spiritual crisis. Both needed me, right now, in different ways. My hands trembled slightly as I rinsed the suds away, torn between the demands of my scissors and my calling."}
