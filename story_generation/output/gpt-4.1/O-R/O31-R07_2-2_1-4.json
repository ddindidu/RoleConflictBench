Shouts echoed through the square, the crowd swelling with anger and fear. As a police officer, I was expected to step in, to enforce the law and keep the peace, even if it meant wading into the chaos. My hand hovered near my belt, heart pounding, every muscle tense and ready.\n\nBut today was also the day of our weekly meditation. My Buddhist sangha would be gathering in the quiet hall, sitting in stillness, breathing in peace. I was supposed to be there, practicing mindfulness, letting go of anger and judgment. The thought of the calm room, the gentle sound of the bell, tugged at me.\n\nI felt torn in two\u2014one part of me called to action, to duty, to the noise and urgency of the street; the other yearning for silence, for compassion, for the inner stillness I\u2019d promised to cultivate. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
