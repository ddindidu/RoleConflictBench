The label was marked \u201cSensitive\u2014Recipient Only.\u201d My job was clear: verify the ID, get the signature, and make sure the package reached the right hands. As I knocked, a frail voice called out, \u201cJust a moment!\u201d The door opened to reveal an elderly woman, her hands trembling as she fumbled for her ID. She looked flustered, apologizing for her slowness, explaining her arthritis made it hard to grip things. I could see her discomfort, and my heart ached. As a Christian, I felt the urge to offer comfort, to help her with the ID, to show patience and kindness as Jesus would. But my company\u2019s policy was strict\u2014no exceptions, no touching the customer\u2019s belongings, no bending the rules. I could see her struggling, and I wanted to ease her burden, but the weight of my responsibility pressed on me. I stood there, torn between the demands of my job and the call to show compassion, wrestling with what I should do next."}
