My training as a lifeguard kicked in: safety first, always. I knew I had to act fast, shut down the pool, and call for repairs before anyone got hurt. But just as I reached for the maintenance log, I noticed Mrs. Thompson, a regular, sitting alone on the bench, her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. She\u2019d lost her husband last week, and today was her first time back. My heart ached; as a Christian, I felt a deep pull to sit with her, to offer comfort and a listening ear, to show the love and kindness my faith demands. But the pool was filling with early swimmers, and the faulty system was a ticking time bomb. I stood frozen, torn between my duty to protect lives and my calling to care for a grieving soul, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
