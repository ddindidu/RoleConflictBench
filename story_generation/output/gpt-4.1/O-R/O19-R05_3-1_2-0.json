The patient\u2019s name, the dosage, the instructions\u2014every detail had to be perfect. I knew that even the smallest error could have devastating consequences. My mind was trained to focus, to block out distractions, but today, my thoughts kept drifting. As a rabbi, I was expected to begin preparing my next Shabbat sermon. The congregation looked to me for guidance, for words that would inspire and comfort them. The pressure to find the right message weighed heavily on me, and the deadline loomed closer with each passing day. I felt the tension building inside me, torn between the life-or-death precision required at the pharmacy and the spiritual responsibility I carried as a rabbi. My heart pounded as I tried to silence the competing voices in my head, knowing that both roles demanded my full attention, yet I could not give myself completely to either in this moment."}
