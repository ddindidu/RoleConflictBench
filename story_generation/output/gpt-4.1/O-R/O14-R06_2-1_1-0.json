Tomorrow, I\u2019d finally have access to the spectrometer\u2014an opportunity that came only once every few months. My team was counting on me to run the experiment, collect the data, and move our research forward. The pressure was immense; missing this window would set us back for weeks, maybe months. But as I glanced at the calendar, my heart sank. Tomorrow was Sunday. I\u2019d promised my family I\u2019d go to church with them, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d honor the Sabbath, keeping it as a day of rest and worship.
