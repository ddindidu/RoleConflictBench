The subject line\u2014\u201cUrgent: Tax Discrepancy Notice\u201d\u2014made my heart skip. As the accountant for our small synagogue, I knew the importance of responding quickly and accurately to the tax authority. Compliance wasn\u2019t just a rule; it was my responsibility to protect our community from penalties. But as I scanned the notice, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the children\u2019s Torah class was about to begin. As their rabbi, I was expected to guide them, to teach not just words but values, to be present and attentive. I could already picture their eager faces, waiting for stories and lessons. My mind raced\u2014if I delayed the tax response, we risked fines or worse. If I missed the class, I\u2019d let down the children and their parents, who trusted me to nurture their faith. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each too important to neglect. I stared at the clock, torn, feeling the tension rise as I tried to decide which part of myself I would have to set aside, if only for a moment."}
