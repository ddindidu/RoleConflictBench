My shift had ended, and I was finally heading to the gym\u2014a rare chance to keep up the strength and stamina my job as a police officer demanded. Protecting the community meant being ready, physically and mentally, for anything. But as I grabbed my water bottle, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the weekly Torah class for the children at the synagogue was about to begin. As their rabbi, I was expected to guide them, to teach them the stories and laws that shaped our lives. I pictured their eager faces, waiting for me to bring the ancient words to life. My badge weighed heavy in my gym bag, while my kippah felt just as heavy in my pocket. The gym was a promise to my fellow officers and to myself; the classroom was a promise to my congregation and to God. I stood in the doorway, torn, the expectations of both worlds pressing in on me, unsure which path to take."}
