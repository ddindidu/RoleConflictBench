The plant\u2019s safety compliance was in question, and if I didn\u2019t address the concerns by tomorrow, operations would be suspended. My mind raced through technical reports and regulatory codes, already drafting responses and solutions. But as I reached for my phone, the bell for evening prayer echoed through the convent halls. I remembered Mother Superior\u2019s gentle request that morning\u2014she wanted me to lead daily reflections for the retreat, starting tonight. The sisters were counting on me for spiritual guidance, to help them find peace and renewal. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the urgent, logical demands of engineering, and the quiet, sacred call of my vocation. My hands trembled as I tried to focus on the scripture, but safety checklists and risk assessments crowded my thoughts. I wondered how I could possibly be present for both, knowing that to fully serve one meant letting the other down."}
