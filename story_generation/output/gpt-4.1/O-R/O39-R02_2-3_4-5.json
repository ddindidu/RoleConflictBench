The foreman\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cSafety first. Don\u2019t leave hazards for the next crew.\u201d I grabbed a mop, ready to clean it up, knowing a single slip could mean a broken bone or worse. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was the church secretary\u2014someone was waiting for me at the chapel, desperate, sobbing, needing guidance right now. As a priest, I knew the weight of a soul in crisis, the expectation that I would drop everything to offer comfort and hope. My hands tightened on the mop handle. If I left the spill, someone could get hurt. If I delayed at the church, I might fail someone in their darkest hour. The demands of both worlds pressed in, each urgent, each impossible to ignore. My heart pounded as I stood between the two, torn by the knowledge that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
