Most days, the calls were routine\u2014polite questions, easy answers, a rhythm I\u2019d grown used to. But today, as I glanced at the clock, my heart pounded. The mosque was filling for the special remembrance, and I alone was authorized to lead the prayer. My supervisor\u2019s eyes flicked over, expecting me to finish my quota, while my phone buzzed with reminders from the mosque committee. I could almost hear the low hum of the gathering, the anticipation in their voices, the weight of their trust. My mind raced\u2014should I stay and finish my calls, meeting my targets and keeping my job secure, or should I leave, fulfilling my duty as imam and not letting the congregation down? The demands pressed in from both sides, each role pulling at me, each expectation heavy with consequence. I sat frozen, torn between the ringing phone and the distant call to prayer, my heart caught in the space between."}
