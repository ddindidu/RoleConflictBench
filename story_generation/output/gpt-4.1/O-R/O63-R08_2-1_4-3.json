My manager\u2019s reminders echo in my mind: \u201cPush harder, don\u2019t let the numbers slip.\u201d I pace around my living room, headset on, laptop open, trying to sound cheerful as I dial yet another number. Today was supposed to be a quiet day at home with my family, so I\u2019m wearing my favorite loose pajamas and a simple t-shirt, comfortable and modest for being around my parents and siblings.\n\nBut as I prepare for the next call, a video meeting notification pops up from my supervisor. \u201cLet\u2019s check in face-to-face,\u201d the message reads. My heart sinks. I know the company expects us to look professional on camera, but I\u2019m not dressed for work\u2014nor am I in my hijab, since I\u2019m only with family. I feel the pressure mounting: do I scramble to change and cover, risking missing sales, or do I join as I am, compromising my values? The demands of my job and my faith pull me in opposite directions, and I can feel the tension tightening in my chest as I hover over the \u201cJoin Meeting\u201d button."}
