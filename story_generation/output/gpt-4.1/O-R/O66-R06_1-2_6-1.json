He slid into the back seat, the sharp scent of alcohol and sweat filling the cab. I glanced in the rearview mirror, noticing the mud caked on his boots and the grime on his jacket. My company expected me to keep the taxi spotless for the next passenger, and I prided myself on my professionalism. But as I started the meter, he mumbled about losing his job and not having anywhere to go. My heart ached\u2014my faith taught me to show compassion, to help those in need, to see Christ in every person. Yet, I could already imagine the complaints if the next rider found the seat dirty, or worse, if my supervisor docked my pay for a messy cab. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between my duty to my job and my calling to live out my Christian values. The man\u2019s eyes met mine in the mirror, silently pleading, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding an answer."}
