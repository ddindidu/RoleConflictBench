As a nursing assistant, I knew my duty was to help her eat, to ease her pain, to be present and patient. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the High Holiday service was only hours away. As the rabbi, I was expected to deliver a sermon that would inspire and comfort the entire congregation. They counted on me to be there, to lead them through this sacred time. My mind raced with the words I still needed to write, the prayers I needed to review. Yet here was Mrs. Goldstein, needing me just as much, her suffering immediate and raw. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the sacred and the practical, the needs of one vulnerable soul and the expectations of many. My hands trembled as I tried to focus on the task before me, torn between the call of compassion at the bedside and the call of tradition at the bimah."}
