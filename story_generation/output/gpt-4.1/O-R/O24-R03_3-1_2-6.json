My heart was set on the hours ahead\u2014time I had promised myself for spiritual reading and silent reflection, a rare sanctuary in my life as a nun. The gentle weight of my rosary in my pocket was a reminder of the peace I craved. Just as I opened my worn prayer book, my clerk rushed in, breathless, holding a thick file. An emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just been filed. The law demanded I review every page, analyze the facts, and make a ruling within the hour. My judge\u2019s mind snapped to attention, already parsing legal arguments, but my soul recoiled at the abrupt intrusion. I felt torn\u2014my duty to justice and the safety of others clashing with my commitment to spiritual discipline and inner stillness. The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, each urgent, each sacred. I stared at the unopened file, my prayer book still in my lap, and felt the weight of both worlds demanding my presence."}
