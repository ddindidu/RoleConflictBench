The client wanted a large dining table, and I needed to estimate the wood, hardware, and finish\u2014then call the supplier before noon. My mind started racing, calculating board feet and delivery times, already picturing the paperwork and the sawdust. But I had promised myself a ten-minute window for meditation, a quiet pause in the day to breathe and let go. As a Buddhist, I knew the importance of mindfulness, of not letting the world sweep me away. Yet, the pressure to keep the business running, to meet deadlines and satisfy customers, pressed in on me. The expectation to be efficient and responsive as a carpenter clashed with my commitment to stillness and presence. I stared at the clock, feeling the tug of both worlds, my hands itching to pick up the phone even as my heart longed for silence."}
