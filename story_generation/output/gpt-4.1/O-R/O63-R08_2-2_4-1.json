Only an hour left in my shift, and I was still three sales short of my weekly target. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week.\u201d I scrolled through my call list, rehearsing my pitch, but my mind kept drifting. Today marked the midpoint of Ramadan, and I was already behind on my daily Quran reading. I had promised myself I would catch up tonight, but the fatigue from fasting and the stress of work made it hard to focus. My phone rang, and I hesitated, torn between making another call and taking a few quiet moments to recite and reflect, as I knew I should. The expectation to be a top performer at work clashed with my desire to be a better Muslim, especially during this sacred month. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which demand to answer first."}
