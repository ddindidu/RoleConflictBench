Fever, joint pain, and a strange rash\u2014none of it fit neatly into any diagnosis I knew. As a doctor, I was expected to rely on evidence, to avoid assumptions, and to give my patient the best possible care based on science. Yet, as I spoke with the patient\u2019s family, I overheard a heated conversation in the hallway. The patient\u2019s brother, a hospital administrator, was pressuring a nurse to alter some records, likely to cover up a previous medical error. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma, to act with honesty and integrity, and to stand against wrongdoing. But as a doctor, my immediate duty was to my patient\u2014solving the medical mystery before me. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding action, each pulling me in a different direction. I felt paralyzed, torn between the oath I took as a physician and the moral code I lived by as a Hindu."}
