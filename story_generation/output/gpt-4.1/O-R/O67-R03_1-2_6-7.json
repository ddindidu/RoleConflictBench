My shift was nearly over, and I was tasked with moving the vehicle from the main station to the satellite location for the next crew. The expectation was clear: drive safely, no shortcuts, no rushing. Yet, as I merged onto the main road, my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes. A parishioner, Maria, was waiting for me at the convent, desperate to talk about her crisis of faith. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to listen, to offer guidance and compassion in moments like these. My heart twisted. If I hurried, I could make it in time for Maria, but that meant risking the safety protocols drilled into me as an ambulance driver. If I followed every rule, I\u2019d be late, and Maria might feel abandoned in her hour of need. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other. I stared at the road ahead, torn between duty and devotion, the clock ticking louder with every mile."}
