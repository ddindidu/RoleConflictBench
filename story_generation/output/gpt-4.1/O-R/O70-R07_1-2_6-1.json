My last delivery was scheduled for 6:30, but the community memorial service at the temple started at 7:00 sharp. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be there early, helping to set up incense and greet the elders. The temple was already buzzing with preparations, and I knew my absence would be noticed. Yet, as a delivery person, I had to meet my customer with a smile, speak politely, and ensure their package arrived safely\u2014no matter how rushed I felt inside.\n\nPulling up to the customer\u2019s address, I rehearsed my greeting, trying to push aside the anxiety gnawing at me. My phone buzzed with a reminder from the temple group chat: \u201cPlease arrive on time for the ceremony.\u201d I felt torn, my mind split between the duty to my job and the responsibility to my spiritual community. The customer opened the door, and I forced a calm expression, but inside, I was wrestling with the impossible expectations pulling me in two directions."}
