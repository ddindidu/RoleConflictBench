The factory manager\u2019s message was urgent: a few machines were running hotter than normal, and they\u2019d missed their last service window. I knew the risks\u2014overheating could mean costly breakdowns or even safety hazards. As the machine repairer, I was expected to get there fast, perform maintenance, and clean the machines thoroughly to keep everything running smoothly.\n\nBut I looked down at my loose, long-sleeved tunic and headscarf, the clothes I wore to honor my faith, especially around family. If I rushed to the factory like this, I\u2019d be out of place among the grease, grime, and mostly male crew. Yet, changing into my usual work overalls would mean stepping out of the modest attire I\u2019d chosen for the day at home. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me\u2014my responsibility to the machines and my commitment to my beliefs. I stood in the hallway, torn, the weight of both roles heavy on my shoulders, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
