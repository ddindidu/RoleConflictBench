The nurse\u2019s voice still rang in my ears: \u201cThe ventilator\u2019s failing. We need you now.\u201d My mind raced through possible faults, each more urgent than the last. As I reached the door, my phone buzzed. It was Ahmed, a gentle soul from the mosque. \u201cImam, I know you\u2019re busy, but I really need to talk. It\u2019s about my marriage. Can you spare a few minutes?\u201d His voice trembled with hope and desperation.\n\nI paused, heart pounding. The machine\u2019s alarms blared through the glass, a patient\u2019s life hanging in the balance. Yet Ahmed\u2019s words tugged at my conscience\u2014he trusted me for guidance, and I knew how much he was struggling.
