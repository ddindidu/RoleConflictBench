The new safety standard had just been updated, and our team was expected to release the product next week. As the lead engineer, it was my responsibility to ensure every box was checked, every test documented. But the evidence for full compliance wasn\u2019t there yet; we needed more time, more data. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need to show conformity for the release. Find a way.\u201d\n\nI felt the weight of my Christian values pressing on me. Honesty, integrity\u2014these weren\u2019t just words I heard on Sundays, but principles I tried to live by every day. Could I sign off on the documentation, knowing we hadn\u2019t met every requirement? The pressure to deliver was immense, and my team was counting on me. But so was my conscience. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the expectations of my profession and the demands of my faith, caught between the need to comply and the call to be truthful."}
