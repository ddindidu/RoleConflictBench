I straighten my headset, ready to greet the next customer with practiced warmth. Most days, the script is my shield\u2014every objection, every question, I have a line for it. Today, though, my mind drifts to the temple. Tonight is the memorial service, a gathering where my presence is not just expected but needed. The community will chant, light incense, and remember those who have passed. I promised to help set up, to be there for the rituals, to support others in their grief.\n\nBut here I am, tethered to my desk, the clock ticking toward the end of my shift. Another call connects. The customer\u2019s question is simple, something I could answer in my sleep, but my heart is pounding. I feel the weight of two worlds: the calm, compassionate presence I strive to be at the temple, and the efficient, persuasive voice I must be here. My supervisor\u2019s eyes flicker over the cubicles, expecting numbers, not excuses. The temple expects my devotion, my community expects my presence. I grip the receiver, torn, as the minutes slip away."}
