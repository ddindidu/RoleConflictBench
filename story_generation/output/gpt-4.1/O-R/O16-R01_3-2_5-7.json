The chart in my hands told a story no family wants to hear. In a few minutes, I would face Mr. Lee\u2019s family, their eyes searching mine for hope, for answers. As a doctor, I owed them honesty, delivered with compassion. I rehearsed the words in my mind, knowing each syllable would land like a stone.\n\nBut as a pastor, my heart ached with another responsibility. I was expected to guide my congregation, to offer them faith and comfort, especially in times of suffering. My sermon for Sunday was unfinished, my mind torn between medical facts and spiritual truths. How could I teach about God\u2019s plan when I was about to shatter someone\u2019s world? The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014one demanding clarity and empathy, the other calling for hope and meaning.\n\nI stared at the closed door, my hands trembling. I wondered if I could be both healer and shepherd in this moment, or if I would fail them all."}
