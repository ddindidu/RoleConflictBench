They wanted clarification on a confusing line item from their latest invoice, and I knew I needed to respond quickly and clearly\u2014my reputation as an accountant depended on it. But as I started drafting my reply, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the children\u2019s Torah class was about to begin. As their rabbi, I was expected to be present, to guide them through the week\u2019s parsha, to answer their questions with patience and warmth. I could picture their eager faces waiting for me in the classroom, their parents trusting me to nurture their children\u2019s Jewish learning. My heart pounded as I weighed the urgency of the client\u2019s financial concern against the sacred responsibility of teaching Torah. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were non-negotiable in their own way. I felt the tension coil inside me, torn between the numbers on my screen and the lessons waiting to be shared."}
