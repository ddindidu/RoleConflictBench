It was a standard agreement, nothing urgent, but I knew my reputation depended on thoroughness. My phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was my turn to chant Torah at synagogue. I had promised weeks ago, and the community expected me to be there, prepared and present. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. As a lawyer, I was expected to review every clause, anticipate every risk, and my client trusted me to catch what others might miss. But as a Jew, I was expected to honor my commitment to the congregation, to show up and participate fully in the service. My mind raced, torn between the quiet pull of my faith and the steady demands of my profession. I stared at the contract, then at my prayer book, feeling the tension knot in my chest as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first."}
