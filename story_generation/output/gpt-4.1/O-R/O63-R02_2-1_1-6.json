The script in front of me felt flimsy, barely covering the basics, and I could sense the caller\u2019s frustration growing. My supervisor expected me to handle every objection smoothly, to keep the conversation moving, but I was floundering, improvising answers and silently praying I wouldn\u2019t say something wrong. \n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series was about to start. As a priest, I was supposed to guide and inspire, to be fully present for my parishioners, especially when organizing something as important as religious education. I imagined the committee waiting for me, expecting leadership and vision. \n\nMy heart pounded as I weighed the demands\u2014my job needed me to stay on the line, to close the sale, but my calling as a priest demanded my presence and care for my community. I felt torn, caught between two worlds, each expecting my undivided attention, and I didn\u2019t know which voice to answer first."}
