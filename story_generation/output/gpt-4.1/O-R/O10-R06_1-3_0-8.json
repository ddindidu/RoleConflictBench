As an accountant, accuracy was everything\u2014one mistake could mean trouble for the whole department. The deadline was looming, and my supervisor had made it clear: no errors, no delays. Just as I was about to finalize the documents, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a colleague, Sarah. She sounded desperate\u2014her mother had been rushed to the hospital, and she needed someone to cover her workload for the rest of the day.\n\nAs a Christian, I felt a deep pull to help her, to show the compassion and love I believed in. But the numbers on my screen blurred as I thought about the expectations on my shoulders. If I stopped now, I might not finish the filings on time, risking my reputation and the trust my team placed in me. Yet, if I ignored Sarah\u2019s plea, I\u2019d be turning away from the very values I tried to live by. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between duty and kindness, not knowing which path to take."}
