As the accountant, I knew I needed to draft a formal reply, acknowledging receipt and clarifying a minor discrepancy in the invoice. The vendor expected prompt, professional communication\u2014anything less could jeopardize our business relationship. My phone buzzed, reminding me of the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series. As the parish priest, I was expected to lead the session, inspire the committee, and lay the groundwork for a season of spiritual growth. The team would be waiting for my guidance, looking to me for vision and encouragement. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. Both roles demanded my immediate attention, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My mind raced, torn between the numbers on my screen and the faces in the parish hall, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
