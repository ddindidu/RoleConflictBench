My fingers move automatically, counting change, but my mind is elsewhere. The clock above the counter ticks closer to nine\u2014morning prayer time. In the convent, the bell will soon ring, calling all sisters to the chapel. I am expected there, kneeling in silent devotion, joining my sisters in song and prayer. But here, behind the counter, I am the only cashier on duty. The manager expects me to stay until my shift ends, to process every transaction with care and accuracy. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the sacred call to prayer, the practical duty to my job. My heart aches with the knowledge that I cannot be in two places at once. The next customer steps forward, and I force a smile, my mind torn between the ringing bell and the ringing register, unsure which call I will answer."}
