She wanted access to the Cohen files\u2014urgent, she said, to prepare a summary for the partners. But she wasn\u2019t briefed on the case, and I knew the rules: client confidentiality was absolute. My legal training screamed at me to protect the files, to uphold the trust my client placed in me. Yet, the pressure from above was real, and the assistant\u2019s request came with a hint of expectation that I\u2019d comply for the sake of efficiency.\n\nMy stomach rumbled, reminding me of another demand. I was traveling for a deposition, and lunchtime was near. The only kosher vendor in the area was a tiny stand down the block, and I\u2019d have to hurry if I wanted to eat before the next meeting. Observing kashrut wasn\u2019t just a habit\u2014it was a commitment, a piece of my identity. But the clock was ticking, and the assistant was waiting for my reply. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give without betraying the other."}
