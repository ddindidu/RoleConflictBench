The store was quiet, and I found comfort in the routine\u2014greeting, bagging, wishing people a good day. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder that Friday prayers were only an hour away. As the imam, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah, a responsibility I never took lightly. The congregation looked to me for guidance, and I had spent the week preparing my sermon. Yet, today, an invited guest speaker was ready to step in if I couldn\u2019t make it.\n\nA customer approached, chatting about her weekend plans, and I forced myself to focus, offering the friendly service my manager expected. But my mind kept drifting to the mosque, to the faces waiting for me, to the words I wanted to share. I felt torn\u2014my duty to my job clashed with my commitment to my faith community. Should I stay and finish my shift, or leave early and fulfill my role as imam? The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I could feel my heart racing as I tried to decide what to do."}
