The alert flashed red\u2014brake system malfunction. My training as a subway operator kicked in: I had to report this immediately, stop the train, and ensure everyone\u2019s safety. But the clock on the dashboard reminded me of the time. My family would be gathering soon, the puja about to begin. I was expected to be there, dressed in my best, chanting prayers with them. Missing it would disappoint my parents and break a promise I\u2019d made to myself to honor our traditions. My hands hovered over the controls, heart pounding. The weight of my uniform pressed against my skin, but so did the memory of my mother\u2019s hopeful smile as she laid out my kurta this morning. The train rumbled on, the alert insistent, and I felt torn in two\u2014between duty to my passengers and devotion to my family and faith."}
