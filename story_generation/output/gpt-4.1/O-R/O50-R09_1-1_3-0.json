As the only senior machine repairer, everyone expected me to lead the servicing\u2014cleaning, calibrating, making sure every conveyor and press would run smoothly when production resumed. It was a big responsibility, and I took pride in it. But as I checked my calendar, my heart sank. The shutdown overlapped with the weekly study session I led for the children at our synagogue. Teaching them about our traditions, the stories of our people, was something I cherished. The parents trusted me to keep the lessons meaningful and consistent. I knew I could reschedule the class, but it would disrupt the rhythm we\u2019d built, and some kids might miss out. At work, they needed my expertise; at the synagogue, the children needed my guidance. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to yield. I sat at my desk, torn, the expectations of my two roles pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which responsibility I would have to let down."}
