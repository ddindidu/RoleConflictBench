As a lifeguard, I knew that high tide was unforgiving\u2014one slip, one missed cry for help, and a life could be lost. My eyes darted from the churning surf to the clusters of children, the elderly wading in, the teenagers daring each other further out. Suddenly, my phone buzzed. It was Miriam, her voice trembling. Her father had just passed away, and the family needed me, their rabbi, to lead the funeral as soon as possible. Jewish tradition calls for burial without delay, and my presence was not just expected\u2014it was essential. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me: the red of the lifeguard, the black of the rabbi. If I left, even for an hour, who would watch the water? But if I stayed, I would fail a grieving family in their hour of need. My heart pounded as I stared at the waves, torn between two sacred duties, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
