The routine audit was weeks away, but my manager had just sent a message: \u201cLet\u2019s get all documentation updated by tomorrow for a spot check.\u201d I knew the expectation\u2014compliance wasn\u2019t just a box to tick; it was about people\u2019s safety, and I took that seriously. \n\nBut my phone buzzed again. This time, it was my Buddhist teacher: \u201cCould you prepare a summary of the Heart Sutra for tomorrow\u2019s session? Your insights would help everyone.\u201d I felt honored, but also anxious. Spiritual study wasn\u2019t something I could rush; it required quiet reflection, a clear mind, and sincerity. \n\nThe weight of both roles pressed on me. My colleagues and the company depended on my diligence, but my sangha and teacher trusted me to share wisdom. I stared at the clock, feeling the hours slip away, torn between the demands of safety and the call to spiritual depth, unsure how to honor both without failing either."}
