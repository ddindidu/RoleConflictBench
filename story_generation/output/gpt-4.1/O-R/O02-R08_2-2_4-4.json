The new safety standard was finally in effect, and as the lead engineer, I was responsible for presenting our compliance evidence at the afternoon office function. The event was formal, and everyone was expected to dress in business attire\u2014suits for men, tailored dresses or skirts for women. But as a Muslim woman, I always wore loose, modest clothing and a hijab, even in professional settings. Today, though, the pressure felt different. My manager had hinted that \u201cfitting in\u201d would help our team\u2019s image in front of the auditors and executives. I could feel the weight of my dual responsibilities: to uphold my faith\u2019s guidelines for modesty, and to represent my team as a competent, adaptable engineer. My heart pounded as I imagined the stares, the whispered comments if I showed up in my usual attire, or the guilt if I compromised. The clock ticked closer to the event, and I sat frozen at my desk, torn between two worlds that both demanded my loyalty."}
