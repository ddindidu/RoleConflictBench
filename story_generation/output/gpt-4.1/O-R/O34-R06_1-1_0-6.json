I sip my coffee, eyes scanning the empty radar screen, grateful for the lull. As an air traffic controller, I\u2019m trained to anticipate chaos, to keep every plane safe and every instruction crisp. But this morning, the sky is mine alone, and I let myself relax\u2014until a pilot\u2019s voice crackles through, tense and unfamiliar. He\u2019s new, his accent thick, and he fumbles with protocol. My training demands efficiency, precision, no room for error or wasted time. But my faith whispers otherwise: patience, kindness, the gentle guidance Jesus would offer. I want to reassure him, to slow down and help, but the expectation to keep the airspace running smoothly tugs at me. If I take too long, I risk disrupting the flow for others. If I rush him, I betray the compassion I strive to live by. My hands hover over the console, heart pounding, caught between the demands of my duty and the call to love my neighbor\u2014even at 30,000 feet."}
