My passenger, a nervous businessman, kept glancing at his watch, reminding me that his international flight was leaving in less than an hour. Every red light, every cautious turn, I felt his impatience pressing on me. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get him there safely and on time, but the roads were treacherous, and I couldn\u2019t risk an accident. My phone buzzed with a reminder: in thirty minutes, I was supposed to meet Mrs. Alvarez at the church. She\u2019d confided in me last Sunday, her voice trembling, about a struggle she couldn\u2019t face alone. As her priest, I was her lifeline, expected to listen, to guide, to be present. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanded speed and focus, the other compassion and presence. My hands tightened on the wheel, heart pounding, as I wrestled with the impossible choice between duty and devotion, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
