My hands ache, but I know the job isn\u2019t done until every scrap is swept and every hazard cleared. The foreman\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cSafety first, always. Leave it spotless.\u201d I glance at the broom, then at my watch. The church bell will ring soon, calling the faithful for evening prayer. As their priest, I am expected to lead them, to offer comfort and guidance, even if tonight\u2019s service is optional. I picture Mrs. Alvarez, who never misses a prayer, and the quiet hope in her eyes. My boots are caked with mud, my shirt stained, but my heart is pulled in two directions. If I stay, I honor my duty to my crew and their safety. If I leave, I honor my calling to serve my community\u2019s spirit. The broom\u2019s handle feels heavy in my grip, and I stand frozen, torn between the dust at my feet and the prayers waiting in the chapel."}
