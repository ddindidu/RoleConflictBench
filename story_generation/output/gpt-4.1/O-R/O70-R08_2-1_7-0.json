As a Muslim, I cherish these rare moments when I can sit in peace, recite the Quran, and reflect on its meaning without any rush. I had planned everything: a cup of tea, my favorite surah, and the gentle hum of the evening outside my window. Just as I settled in, my phone buzzed. It was a customer from earlier, asking about the status of their delivery. As a delivery person, I\u2019m expected to respond quickly and professionally, always polite and helpful, no matter the hour. But my heart was already in a different place, yearning for spiritual connection and tranquility. I stared at the phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014one demanding immediate attention and courteous communication, the other calling me to spiritual devotion and inner peace. The conflict twisted inside me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
