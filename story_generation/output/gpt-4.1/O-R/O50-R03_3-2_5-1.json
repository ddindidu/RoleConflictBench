I knew the sound well\u2014if I didn\u2019t act now, the entire line could grind to a halt, costing the factory precious hours and risking my reputation as a reliable repairer. My supervisor\u2019s words from this morning rang in my ears: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any downtime today. Stay sharp.\u201d I reached for my toolbox, but my phone buzzed urgently. Sister Maria\u2019s message flashed on the screen: \u201cThe Johnsons\u2019 house burned down. They need us at the shelter\u2014food, clothes, comfort. Please come quickly.\u201d \n\nMy habit felt heavier than usual, the cross at my neck pressing against my skin. I could picture the Johnson children, shivering and lost, waiting for a gentle hand and a warm meal. But the machine\u2019s wail grew louder, demanding my skill and attention.
