She placed a battered toy on my workbench and asked if I could fix it for her grandson\u2019s birthday\u2014this Sunday. I examined the toy, calculating the hours it would take to repair and repaint it. She needed a quote, and I knew the job would require me to work through the weekend to finish on time.\n\nBut Sunday was also the day I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d return to church. I\u2019d missed the last few services, always with a good reason\u2014urgent jobs, late nights, customers counting on me. Still, I felt the weight of my faith pressing on my conscience. I longed for the peace of worship, the sense of belonging, the chance to reconnect with my community. Yet, as a carpenter, I prided myself on reliability and craftsmanship. Mrs. Evans was counting on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down.\n\nStanding there, hands rough with sawdust, I felt torn between the call of my trade and the quiet pull of my faith, uncertain which voice I should answer."}
