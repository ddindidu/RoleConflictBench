My telemarketing shift was relentless\u2014calls queued up, and the compliance system tracked every second. If I left my desk even a minute outside my scheduled break, the system would flag me, and I\u2019d risk a warning or worse. But today wasn\u2019t just any Friday. I was the only imam scheduled for the Khutbah, and the community had already shared the topic I\u2019d prepared. People would be gathering soon, expecting guidance and inspiration. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands: the company\u2019s rigid rules versus my responsibility to the congregation.
