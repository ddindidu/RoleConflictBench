The new furniture order was more complicated than I\u2019d expected. I needed to estimate the wood, nails, and varnish, and place the order before the supplier closed for the day. My mind raced through measurements and costs, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the family ceremony was tonight. As a Hindu, I was expected to arrive on time, dressed in my best kurta, to join my family in prayers and rituals. My mother had called twice already, reminding me not to be late, not to let work overshadow tradition. But the client was waiting for my estimate, and if I delayed, the whole project would fall behind. I could almost hear the disappointment in my father\u2019s voice if I missed the ceremony, but I could also imagine the frustration of my client if I didn\u2019t deliver. Torn between the demands of my craft and my faith, I stood in my workshop, hands trembling, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
