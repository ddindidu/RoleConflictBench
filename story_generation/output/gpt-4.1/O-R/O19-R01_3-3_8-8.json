The national pharmacy education program was just days away, and I\u2019d been preparing for weeks\u2014reading up on new drug therapies, reviewing case studies, determined to stay at the forefront of my profession. My patients depended on me to know the latest treatments, and I took that responsibility seriously. But as I flipped through my notes, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the intensive workshop I\u2019d organized for our church leaders was scheduled for the same weekend. Months of planning had gone into it. The congregation looked to me to guide them, to help them wrestle with difficult theological questions and apply faith to their lives. I could picture their eager faces, the trust in their eyes. I felt torn in two, the weight of both callings pressing down on me. How could I let down my patients or my church? My mind raced, caught between the demands of science and spirit, duty and devotion, as the days ticked closer and I realized I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
