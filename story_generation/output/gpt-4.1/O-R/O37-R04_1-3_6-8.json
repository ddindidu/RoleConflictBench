As a housekeeping cleaner, I knew the rules\u2014gloves on, hands washed, every surface spotless. My supervisor had reminded me just this morning: \u201cNo shortcuts, especially with hygiene.\u201d I was careful, but sometimes, when the work piled up, I\u2019d slip the gloves off for a moment to move faster.\n\nSuddenly, I heard hurried footsteps echoing down the hall. A young man burst in, his face streaked with tears. \u201cImam, please, I need to talk. I just lost my father.\u201d His voice trembled, desperate for comfort. As the imam, I was expected to offer immediate support, to listen, to hold his hand if needed, to be present in his pain.\n\nBut my hands were still gloved, damp with cleaning solution.
