As a judge, I know the importance of staying current\u2014my rulings must reflect not only the letter of the law but also its living spirit. I feel a familiar excitement as I imagine delving into the articles, sharpening my understanding, and preparing for the cases ahead. Yet, as the sun dips lower, the gentle chime of my phone reminds me of another commitment: tonight is the community memorial service at the temple. As a Buddhist, I am expected to be present, to join in the chanting, and to offer support to those who grieve. The community looks to me for guidance and compassion, especially during these rituals. I feel the pull of both worlds\u2014one demanding intellectual rigor and solitary study, the other calling for presence, humility, and shared sorrow. My mind races, torn between the silent wisdom of the written word and the living wisdom of compassionate action. The clock ticks on, and I sit, wrestling with the weight of both robes I wear."}
