I still needed three more sales to hit my weekly target, and management\u2019s reminders echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cNumbers matter, every call counts.\u201d My fingers hovered over the dialer, but my phone buzzed with a calendar alert: the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series was about to start. As a priest, I was expected to guide and inspire, to be present for my parishioners, especially when shaping the spiritual journey of the community. But as a telemarketer, I was expected to push through, to keep calling, to not let up until the quota was met. My heart pounded with guilt and anxiety. If I missed the meeting, I\u2019d let down the church and my calling. If I left my desk, I\u2019d fall short at work\u2014again. I stared at the phone, torn between the demands of my faith and my job, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which voice to answer first."}
