My supervisor, noticing the lull, tells us we can take our breaks whenever we want. I glance at the clock\u2014my scheduled break is still an hour away, but the temptation is strong. Ramadan is halfway through, and I\u2019m behind on my daily Quran reading. Each day, I promise myself I\u2019ll catch up, but the calls and targets always seem to get in the way. Now, with this unexpected free time, I could slip away to the prayer room, open my Quran, and finally reflect in peace. But the telemarketer in me hesitates. We\u2019re supposed to stick to our schedules, and even with the supervisor\u2019s casual nod, I worry about setting a bad example or missing a sudden spike in calls. My heart aches with the weight of both duties\u2014one to my faith, the other to my job. I sit at my desk, torn, the Quran app open on my phone beneath the desk, the headset still resting on my ears, waiting for the next call or the courage to step away."}
