The machines had been running hotter than usual, and I knew skipping the last maintenance window was a mistake. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford another breakdown. Make sure everything\u2019s spotless and running smooth before the shift ends.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014just half an hour until Friday prayers. I hurried to the washroom, scrubbing the grease from my hands, but the oil had seeped into my overalls and under my nails. \n\nI pulled out my clean shirt and trousers from my locker, but the grime clung stubbornly to my skin and sleeves. I hesitated, knowing the expectation to enter the prayer hall in clean, modest clothing. My heart pounded with anxiety. If I took more time to clean up, the machines might overheat again, risking a costly shutdown. But if I rushed, I\u2019d enter the mosque not fully clean, falling short of the respect and modesty my faith demands. I stood there, torn between my duty to my job and my responsibility as a Muslim, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
