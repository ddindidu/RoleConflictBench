The new client, a young woman, stared at her reflection, her lips pressed into a thin line. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not quite what I expected,\u201d she said quietly, her disappointment clear. My heart sank. As a hairdresser, I knew I should stay, listen, and do everything possible to make her happy. But the call to prayer was only minutes away, and as the imam, I was expected to lead, to be present for the small congregation that gathered faithfully each day. I knew another worshipper could step in, but I also knew my absence would be noticed, perhaps even questioned. My mind raced between the anxious client in my chair and the waiting prayer hall. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my presence, each expecting my full attention. I stood there, scissors in hand, torn between the mirror and the mihrab, unsure which duty to answer first."}
