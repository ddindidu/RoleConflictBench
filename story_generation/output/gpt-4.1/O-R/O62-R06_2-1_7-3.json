As a lifeguard, I knew my duty was clear: enforce the rules, keep everyone safe, even if it meant being the \u201cbad guy.\u201d My supervisor expected vigilance, and the parents trusted me to protect their kids. But as I watched the clock inch closer to ten, my thoughts drifted to the church service starting soon. Sunday worship was more than a routine for me\u2014it was a time to reconnect with my faith and community, something I\u2019d been missing lately because of these weekend shifts. The pastor always said our presence mattered, that we were part of something bigger. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the responsibility to keep these kids safe, and the longing to be present in worship, to not let my faith slip away. My heart pounded as I glanced between the rowdy teens and the time ticking by, torn between the pool deck and the pews, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
