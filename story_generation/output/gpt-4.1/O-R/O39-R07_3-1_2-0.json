My hands, calloused and steady, gripped the rope, every muscle tensed with the urgency of the moment. The beam had to be set now, before the wind picked up or the operator lost patience. I knew the team depended on me to keep the work moving, to keep everyone safe.\n\nBut as I steadied the load, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a gentle reminder of the evening chant at the temple. Tonight was my turn to lead the recitation, to sit cross-legged among the saffron robes, my voice joining the others in calm, rhythmic prayer. The community expected my presence, my devotion, my example.\n\nI felt the weight of the beam in my hands and the weight of expectation in my heart. The noise of the site clashed with the imagined hush of the temple. I stood between two worlds, torn by the demands of duty and devotion, uncertain which call to answer."}
