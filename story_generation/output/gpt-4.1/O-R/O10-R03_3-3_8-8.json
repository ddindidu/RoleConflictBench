The supplier\u2019s voice from this morning echoed in my mind\u2014if we didn\u2019t pay the overdue invoice by tomorrow, they\u2019d stop all shipments. As the convent\u2019s accountant, it was my duty to resolve this, to negotiate, to keep our pantry and pharmacy stocked. But the clock on the wall reminded me: in an hour, I was to lead the first of the daily reflections for the retreat, a responsibility the Mother Superior entrusted to me. She expected me to be present, centered, and spiritually prepared, guiding the sisters in prayer and contemplation. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles. I could feel the tension in my shoulders\u2014how could I focus on spiritual matters when the financial future of our community was at stake? Yet, how could I let down the sisters who looked to me for spiritual guidance? The phone buzzed again, and I stared at it, torn between answering the call and opening my prayer book, caught in the silent storm of conflicting expectations."}
