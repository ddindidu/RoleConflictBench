My next passenger was already messaging, \u201cPlease hurry, I\u2019m late for an interview!\u201d I knew the expectation: be prompt, courteous, professional. My livelihood depended on it. But as I glanced at my phone, another message flashed\u2014a call from the mayor. The hurricane had torn through our town last night, leaving devastation in its wake. \u201cSister, we need you at the shelter. People are desperate. Can you help organize the relief?\u201d My heart clenched. As a nun, I was expected to serve, to be present for those in need, especially now. I could picture the frightened faces, the chaos at the community center. Yet, here I was, a taxi driver with a commitment to a passenger who was counting on me. The weight of both uniforms pressed on my shoulders, each demanding my presence, each urgent in its own way. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I stared at the road ahead, torn between duty and compassion, between the needs of one and the needs of many."}
