My job as their housekeeper is to keep everything spotless, and Mrs. Johnson expects nothing less. I should have checked the supplies yesterday, but my mind was elsewhere\u2014on the retreat at the convent. Mother Superior had just asked me to lead daily reflections for the sisters, a responsibility that fills me with both honor and anxiety. I know I need to spend time in prayer and study to prepare, but now, with the Johnsons\u2019 kitchen in disarray and no cleaner left, I feel pulled in two directions. If I leave to buy supplies, I\u2019ll lose precious hours meant for spiritual preparation. If I stay and study, the Johnsons will return to a kitchen that doesn\u2019t meet their standards. My heart aches with the weight of these expectations, each role demanding my full attention, and I stand in the middle, torn and uncertain."}
