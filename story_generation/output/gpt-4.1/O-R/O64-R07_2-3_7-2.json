My manager expects me to keep things moving, to be friendly and efficient, especially during the lunch rush. I nod and chat, but my mind drifts to the monastery, where the annual festival is beginning. I promised the sangha I\u2019d help with the dawn preparations\u2014arranging flowers, lighting incense, chanting with the others. It\u2019s a sacred duty, one I look forward to all year, a chance to deepen my practice and support my community. But here I am, stuck behind the register, feeling the weight of both worlds. The customers expect warmth and speed; my Buddhist community expects presence and commitment. I feel my chest tighten as I glance at the clock, torn between the hum of the store and the distant sound of temple bells, knowing I can\u2019t be in both places at once."}
