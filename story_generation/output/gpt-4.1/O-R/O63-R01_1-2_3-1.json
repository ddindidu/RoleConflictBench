My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cPush harder, don\u2019t let up. Every call counts.\u201d I could almost feel the bonus slipping into my bank account if I just kept dialing, kept persuading, kept closing. The phone rang again, but before I could answer, my other phone buzzed\u2014a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She wrote, \u201cCan we talk? I really need guidance about something important.\u201d \n\nAs a pastor, I knew what was expected of me: to listen, to care, to offer wisdom and comfort. But the clock was ticking, and every minute spent away from my sales calls was a minute lost, a potential sale gone. My heart twisted. Was I supposed to be the relentless telemarketer, chasing numbers and quotas, or the compassionate pastor, present for someone in need? The demands pulled at me from both sides, and I sat frozen, torn between the ringing phone and the silent plea for help."}
