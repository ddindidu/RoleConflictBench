Dispatch had called me to a sprained ankle\u2014urgent, but not life or death. My training as a driver demanded I keep a cool head, obey the rules, and ensure everyone\u2019s safety, even if it meant arriving late. But my phone buzzed again. The mayor\u2019s voice, urgent and pleading, reminded me of my other calling: Sister Maria, the nun, needed at the church to coordinate food and shelter for hurricane victims. Hundreds depended on me to organize volunteers and supplies. My heart ached, torn between the patient waiting for help and the desperate families needing hope. I could almost hear my sisters\u2019 voices, praying for guidance, while the ambulance radio crackled with updates. The city expected me to be calm and careful; my faith demanded I be present and compassionate. I stared at the sea of cars, feeling the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
