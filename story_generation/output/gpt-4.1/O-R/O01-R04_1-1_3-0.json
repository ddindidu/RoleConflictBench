As an architect, I knew the importance of functional spaces, and I wanted every corner to serve a purpose. The design was simple, nothing extravagant\u2014just enough to make my work more efficient. Yet, as I drew, the call to prayer echoed from the mosque next door. I glanced at the clock. It was almost time to lead the congregation. \n\nAs the imam, I was expected to guide the prayers, to be present for the community, even if today the congregation was small and another qualified worshipper could easily step in. My mind tugged in two directions: the satisfaction of completing my design, the duty to lead my community. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my presence, each with its own expectations. My heart raced as I tried to decide which responsibility to honor, knowing that whichever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
