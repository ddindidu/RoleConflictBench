The deadline was generous, and I knew I could make this code shine\u2014clean, efficient, something I\u2019d be proud to leave for the next developer. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, itching to dive in, to lose myself in the logic and structure. But then my phone buzzed, a calendar reminder flashing: \u201cReligious School Class \u2013 30 minutes.\u201d I was supposed to teach the children today, to share Torah stories and guide them through the week\u2019s lesson.

My mind tugged in two directions\u2014one toward the satisfaction of perfect code, the other toward the sacred responsibility of teaching.
