As a doctor, I owed my patients my full attention, and today, a young woman sat before me, sniffling and coughing. Her symptoms pointed to a common cold, but I knew I should be thorough\u2014sometimes, the most ordinary signs hid something more serious. Yet, my phone buzzed with messages from my family, reminding me that the festival rituals would begin soon, and my presence was essential. As a Hindu, I was expected to travel home, participate in the ceremonies, and honor my ancestors. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the duty to diagnose with care, and the pull of tradition and family. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to rush through the appointment, torn between my patient\u2019s trust and my community\u2019s expectations."}
