It was a standard service agreement, nothing urgent, but I prided myself on being thorough and timely. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the midday prayer was in less than an hour. Normally, I could rely on the backup imam, but he was out of town, and the congregation would be expecting me. I glanced at the contract again, feeling the weight of my client\u2019s trust. They counted on me to catch every detail, to protect their interests. Yet, as imam, I knew the community looked to me for spiritual guidance, especially today. My mind raced, torn between the silent expectation of my client and the visible anticipation of the worshippers. I felt the pressure mounting, the two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my presence, my focus, my care."}
