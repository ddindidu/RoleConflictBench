The factory was quiet, the hum of production slowed to a crawl, and I knew this was the best chance to finally diagnose the problem. My mind was deep in circuits and error codes when my phone buzzed. It was Ahmed, a gentle soul from the mosque, texting, \u201cIf you have a moment today, I\u2019d love to talk. No rush, just whenever you\u2019re free.\u201d As the imam, I knew what that meant\u2014he needed guidance, maybe comfort, and he trusted me to provide it. But the machine\u2019s issue was urgent too; if I didn\u2019t fix it now, it could halt production when things picked up again. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the silent expectation from my boss to keep the machines running, and the quiet plea from Ahmed for spiritual support. My hands trembled slightly, torn between the cold logic of wires and the warmth of human connection, unsure which duty should come first."}
