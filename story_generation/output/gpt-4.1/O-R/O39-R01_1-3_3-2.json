As a construction laborer, I knew the foreman expected every corner swept, every hazard cleared before we clocked out. Safety was non-negotiable, and I took pride in leaving my area spotless. But as I reached for the broom, my phone buzzed. It was a desperate message from Maria, a member of my congregation. She was waiting at the church, her life unraveling, needing guidance only her pastor could give. My heart pounded. The crew was counting on me to finish the cleanup, but Maria\u2019s text was raw with pain, and I knew her choices tonight could change everything for her. I stared at the broom, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The dust swirled at my feet, and I stood frozen, torn between the safety of my coworkers and the soul of someone in crisis, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
