I had only an hour left in my shift as a telemarketer, and I was still three sales short of my weekly target. Management\u2019s emails echoed in my mind\u2014reminders of bonuses, warnings about quotas. My fingers hovered over the call list, ready to dial again, but my phone buzzed with a calendar alert: the daily prayer service at the chapel was about to begin. As a priest, I was expected to lead the community in prayer, even if today\u2019s service was routine and optional. I pictured the small group of regulars waiting in the quiet sanctuary, expecting my presence, my guidance. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles\u2014one demanding numbers, the other seeking my spirit. I stared at the phone, torn between the next call and the chapel door, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
