Her hair was damp with sweat, strands sticking together after her gym session. She smiled apologetically, \u201cSorry, I just came from a workout.\u201d As a hairdresser, I knew I should wash and condition her hair before starting, making sure it was clean and manageable for the cut she wanted. It was part of my job, and clients expected nothing less.\n\nBut as I led her to the sink, my mind wandered to the envelope of savings tucked away at home. This year, my friends were finally going to Hajj, and I had enough set aside to join them. It was a dream I\u2019d carried for years, a religious duty I longed to fulfill. Yet, every time I considered taking time off, I worried about losing clients or disappointing them. The salon was busiest in summer, and my absence would mean rescheduling appointments, maybe even losing regulars who relied on me.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my hands in her hair, my heart in Mecca. The water ran warm, but inside, I was torn, caught between the expectations of my faith and the demands of my work."}
