I was tired, my mind foggy from a long day, but I knew I had to stay sharp\u2014this was when I handled the high-value transactions, and any mistake could mean a big loss for the store. As a cashier, accuracy was everything; my manager trusted me to get it right, and I didn\u2019t want to let anyone down.\n\nBut as I counted the cash, I noticed a small discrepancy. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was there. My heart pounded. I remembered the teachings from church about honesty and integrity, about how even the smallest lie or cover-up was wrong in the eyes of God. Yet, I also knew that admitting a mistake could mean trouble\u2014maybe even losing my job. The pressure to be perfect at work clashed with my need to be truthful. I stared at the register, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which expectation I could bear to break."}
