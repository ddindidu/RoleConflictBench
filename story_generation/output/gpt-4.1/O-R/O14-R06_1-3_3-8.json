My research notes were scattered before me, and I knew I should update the logs with today\u2019s results. It wasn\u2019t urgent\u2014my supervisor trusted me to keep things in order, and the logs could wait until tomorrow. Still, accuracy and timeliness were part of my responsibility as a scientist. \n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a friend: her father was in the hospital, and she was overwhelmed, asking if I could come sit with her. I felt a tug in my chest. As a Christian, I believed in showing love and kindness, especially in moments like this. Jesus taught compassion, and I knew my friend needed me. \n\nBut the weight of my scientific duty pressed on me. If I left now, I\u2019d be putting off my work, risking mistakes or forgetting details. Yet, if I stayed, I\u2019d be ignoring someone in need. The expectations of both roles pulled at me, and I sat frozen, heart pounding, torn between the call of my profession and the call of my faith."}
