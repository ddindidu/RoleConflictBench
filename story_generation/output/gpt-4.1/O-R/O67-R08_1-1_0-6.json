My uniform feels heavy on my shoulders, a constant reminder of the responsibility I carry. Every second, I must be ready\u2014ready to speed through the city, sirens blaring, to save a life. The expectation is clear: no hesitation, no delay. But as I wait for the next call, my mind drifts to Mecca. I see the crowds circling the Kaaba, hear the prayers rising in unison. As a Muslim, I am expected to perform Hajj at least once in my life. My parents remind me gently, my heart aches with longing, but my salary barely covers rent and food. Each month, I set aside a little, but emergencies never wait, and overtime hours are unpredictable. I feel torn\u2014between the urgent demands of my job and the sacred duty of my faith. The radio crackles again, and I grip the steering wheel, wrestling with the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
