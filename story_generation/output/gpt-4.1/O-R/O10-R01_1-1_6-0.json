As an accountant, I knew I needed to reply to the vendor\u2019s automated payment confirmation with a formal acknowledgment\u2014something I prided myself on doing promptly and professionally. My inbox pinged again, but this time it was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. Her words were heavy with worry, hinting at a personal crisis. As her pastor, I felt a deep responsibility to offer comfort and guidance, to be present for her in her time of need.\n\nI stared at the two messages, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me. The vendor expected efficiency and formality, a quick, businesslike response. Sarah needed warmth, empathy, and my undivided attention. My heart tugged in one direction, my professional duty in another. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between the demands of my spreadsheet and the silent plea for help in Sarah\u2019s words. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, uncertain which message to answer first."}
