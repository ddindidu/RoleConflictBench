The contractor\u2019s timeline pressed on my mind, but my eyes kept returning to a structural detail that didn\u2019t sit right. If I didn\u2019t insist on changes, someone could get hurt. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that Mrs. Alvarez would arrive in ten minutes. She\u2019d confided in me last Sunday, her voice trembling, about her son\u2019s troubles. As her priest, I knew she needed my full attention, my compassion, my time. But as an architect, I couldn\u2019t ignore the risk in these plans. Both roles demanded urgency: the safety of a building, the safety of a soul. My heart pounded as I glanced between the clock and the blueprints, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
