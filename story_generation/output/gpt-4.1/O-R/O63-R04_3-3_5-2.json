Only two hours left until the quarter closed, and my sales numbers were still short. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need every call, every sale, or we all lose out.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my heart wasn\u2019t in it. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee: the special remembrance gathering had begun, and the congregation was waiting. No one else could lead the prayer. I looked at the list of prospects, then at the prayer schedule. The pressure from my team and the responsibility to my community pulled me in opposite directions. I could almost hear the congregation\u2019s expectant silence, just as I could feel my colleagues\u2019 anxious glances from across the office. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the sacred duty I alone could fulfill. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, knowing I had to choose, but not yet knowing which call to answer."}
