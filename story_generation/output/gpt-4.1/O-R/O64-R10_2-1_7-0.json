I stand behind the register, smiling and greeting each person, scanning groceries as quickly as I can. My manager expects me to be cheerful and efficient, and I try my best to meet those expectations, even as the line grows longer and the noise in the store swells. But as the clock ticks past noon, I feel a familiar tug inside me\u2014a reminder that I haven\u2019t performed my midday prayer. As a Hindu, I\u2019m supposed to pause, even briefly, to recite my mantra and center myself. I try to whisper the words under my breath between customers, but guilt gnaws at me. Am I disrespecting my faith by rushing through the ritual? Am I letting down my job if I pause for even a moment? The pressure from both sides builds, and I can feel my heart pounding as I wrestle with what to do next."}
