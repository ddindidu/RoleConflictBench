The production outage was my fault\u2014a bug in my code had brought the service down, and customers were locked out. My manager\u2019s messages pinged urgently, and the pressure to fix it was crushing. As I scrambled to patch the defect, I glanced up and saw a coworker quietly cut in front of another in the coffee line. It was a small thing, but my upbringing as a Hindu pressed on my conscience: I should speak up, stand for fairness, uphold dharma even in little moments. But the outage demanded every ounce of my focus, and the thought of pausing\u2014even for a minute\u2014felt impossible. My mind spun between the duty to my team and users, and the quiet voice urging me to act on my values. I sat frozen, torn between the code and my conscience, unsure which role to answer first."}
