As an engineer, I was expected to sketch out preliminary ideas for the new water filtration system, even though the project was still in its early stages. My mind buzzed with possibilities\u2014should I propose a solar-powered design, or wait until more data came in? There was time, I reminded myself; nothing was urgent yet.\n\nBut the clock ticked toward the hour I\u2019d set aside for spiritual reading. As a nun, I was expected to nurture my soul, to spend quiet afternoons in reflection and prayer. The Psalms waited on my bedside table, their pages promising peace and clarity. Yet, the technical questions tugged at me, refusing to be silenced. I felt torn, the weight of both callings pressing in\u2014one demanding innovation and foresight, the other inviting stillness and surrender. My heart ached with the tension, unsure which voice to heed as the afternoon sun slanted through the window."}
