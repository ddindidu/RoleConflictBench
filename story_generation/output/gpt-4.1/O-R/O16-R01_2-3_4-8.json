As a doctor, I had just finished explaining a new chronic diagnosis to Mrs. Lee. Her eyes were wide with worry, her hands trembling as she clutched the pamphlet I\u2019d given her. She needed me to answer her questions, to reassure her, to walk her through the maze of medications and lifestyle changes. I could see the fear in her face, and I knew I couldn\u2019t rush this conversation.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again\u2014a reminder that the workshop I\u2019d organized as a pastor was about to begin. Community leaders were gathering in the church hall, waiting for me to guide them through a dense curriculum on faith and practice. They expected clarity, inspiration, and my full attention. I could almost hear the hum of anticipation, the shuffling of notes, the silent prayers for wisdom.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. Both roles demanded my presence, my empathy, my leadership. I stared at Mrs. Lee, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both callings pressing down on me, unsure which need was greater in that moment."}
