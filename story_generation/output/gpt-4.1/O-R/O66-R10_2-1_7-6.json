They smiled, asking if I could help load their bags and if they could split the fare to the train station. I nodded, already calculating the best route in my head, determined to offer the professional service my job demanded. As I hoisted their luggage into the trunk, the sound of drums and laughter drifted from the next street. I glanced over and saw bright marigold garlands and the flicker of oil lamps\u2014today was the festival my family and community had been preparing for all week. My phone buzzed with messages from my mother, reminding me to join the prayers and help with the rituals. The travelers, curious, paused to watch the festivities, chatting about the colors and music. I felt a tug inside\u2014my duty as a driver to deliver them promptly, and my heart\u2019s pull toward the celebration, the sense of belonging and spiritual fulfillment waiting just steps away. I stood by the open trunk, torn between the expectations of my passengers and the call of my faith, unsure which path to follow."}
