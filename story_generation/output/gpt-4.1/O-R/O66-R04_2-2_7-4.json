Two travelers waved me down, their arms full of suitcases, faces flushed with urgency. \u201cCan you help us load these? We need to split the fare to the airport,\u201d one asked, glancing at his watch. I nodded, feeling the weight of their expectation for professional, timely service. As I hoisted their bags into the trunk, my phone buzzed with a reminder: Friday prayer, khutbah at noon. I was the only imam scheduled, and the community had already shared my sermon topic online. I pictured the congregation gathering, waiting for my words, relying on me for guidance. My heart pounded as I weighed the travelers\u2019 need for a reliable driver against my duty to lead the prayer. Both roles demanded my presence, both were urgent, and I felt the pressure mounting inside me, torn between the trust of my passengers and the faith of my community."}
