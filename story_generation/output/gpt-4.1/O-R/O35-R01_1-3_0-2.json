The clock on the console blinked, reminding me it was time for the pre-departure check. It was routine\u2014lights, doors, announcements\u2014nothing critical, but still required for a safe, punctual departure. My radio crackled with updates from the control room, and I knew the passengers were counting on me to get them to their destinations on time.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Maria, a member of my congregation. She was in the waiting area, desperate, her words trembling with fear and confusion. She needed guidance\u2014right now. Her choices tonight could change her life forever, and she was looking to me, her pastor, for help. I could see her through the window, pacing, eyes searching for reassurance.\n\nMy hands hovered over the controls. The weight of two worlds pressed down on me: the responsibility to hundreds of commuters, and the call to shepherd a soul in crisis. Both roles demanded my presence, my attention, my care. I felt torn, the seconds ticking by, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
