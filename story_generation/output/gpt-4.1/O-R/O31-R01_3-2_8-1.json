As a police officer, I knew my duty was clear: act with integrity, present the facts, and uphold justice. The court date was set for Thursday morning, and my presence was not just requested\u2014it was required. But as a pastor, my phone buzzed with a message from Maria, a member of my congregation. She was in crisis, her voice trembling as she asked if I could meet her Thursday morning. She needed guidance, she said, to make a decision that would change her life. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me. The law demanded my testimony; my faith called me to shepherd Maria through her storm. I could not be in two places at once, and both roles expected my unwavering commitment. My heart pounded as I stared at the calendar, torn between the badge and the collar, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
