My training as a subway operator kicked in\u2014protocol demanded I report the issue and halt the train immediately for everyone\u2019s safety. My heart pounded, knowing that any delay could put lives at risk. But as I reached for the radio, my mind drifted to the convent. Today was the monthly food drive, and I was expected to help serve meals to the homeless. The sisters counted on me, and so did the people who would come hungry, hoping for a warm meal and a kind word. I felt the weight of my habit under my uniform, a constant reminder of my vows to serve others. The train sped through the tunnel, and I was torn between my duty to the passengers and my commitment to my faith community. The pressure of both worlds pressed in on me, and I hesitated, caught between the urgent demands of safety and the quiet call to compassion."}
