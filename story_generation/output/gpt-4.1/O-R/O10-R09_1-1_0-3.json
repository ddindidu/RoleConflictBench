As an accountant, accuracy was everything\u2014one mistake could mean hours of backtracking or worse, a reprimand from my supervisor. The pressure to finish before the end of the day was mounting, and my stomach growled, reminding me I hadn\u2019t eaten since breakfast. I reached for the snack basket on the corner of the table, only to realize the only thing left was a box of cheese crackers, not marked kosher. The kosher pantry was just down the hall, but leaving my desk now would break my concentration and cost me precious time. My mind raced: do I risk a lapse in my religious observance for the sake of my professional responsibility, or do I step away, possibly missing a crucial deadline? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, torn between my commitment to my faith and my duty as an accountant."}
