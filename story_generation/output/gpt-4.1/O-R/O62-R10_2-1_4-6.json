Swim lessons were starting soon, and if I didn\u2019t fix it, the kids would be at risk of drifting into each other. As a lifeguard, it was my responsibility to keep everything in order, and I could already imagine my supervisor\u2019s disappointment if I let this slide. \n\nBut as I knelt to inspect the rope, the distant sound of drums and chanting drifted in from the street. Today was a special festival, one I\u2019d grown up celebrating with my family. I could see the colorful decorations and smell the incense from the temple across the road. My heart ached to join, to offer prayers and feel the warmth of the community. I knew my family expected me to participate, to honor our traditions. \n\nI stood there, torn between the urgent duty at the pool and the pull of my faith, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
