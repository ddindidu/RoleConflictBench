Her eyes darted around, searching for reassurance. As a hairdresser, I knew my job was to greet her warmly, to make her feel at ease in this unfamiliar place. I smiled, ready to welcome her, but my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the main weekly service at the church was about to begin. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, to be present for everyone who counted on me for spiritual guidance. My heart pounded as I glanced from the nervous client to the clock on the wall. I could see the hope in her eyes, the silent plea for comfort, while at the same time, I felt the weight of my congregation\u2019s expectations pressing down on me. Torn between two worlds, I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
