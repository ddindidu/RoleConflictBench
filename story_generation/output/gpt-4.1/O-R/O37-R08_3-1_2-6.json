Every room I enter, I scrub and polish until the floors shine, making sure not a speck of dust remains. My supervisor expects nothing less\u2014every corner must be spotless, every surface sanitized. I take pride in my work, but the hours are long, and the pay is just enough to cover my rent and send a little home.\n\nAs I wipe down the mirrors, my mind drifts to the call of Hajj. My family and community remind me that performing the pilgrimage is a duty for every Muslim who is able. I feel the weight of their expectations, the longing in my own heart to stand in Mecca, to fulfill this pillar of my faith. But the cost is far beyond what I can save, especially with my current wages and the constant need to support my loved ones.\n\nI feel torn, caught between the demands of my job and the spiritual obligation that grows heavier each year. My hands move automatically, cleaning, while my thoughts swirl with guilt and longing, unsure which duty should come first."}
