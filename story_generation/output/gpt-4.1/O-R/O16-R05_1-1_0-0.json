The symptoms were classic, almost certainly a common cold, but I knew I had to be thorough\u2014my duty as a doctor demanded it. I listened carefully, asked about her medical history, and considered whether any tests were necessary. Yet, as she spoke, my mind drifted to my other calling. Shabbat was approaching, and I hadn\u2019t even begun to think about my next sermon. The congregation expected inspiration, wisdom, and relevance, and I felt the weight of their anticipation pressing on me. I tried to focus on Mrs. Goldstein, but phrases and themes for the sermon swirled in my head, competing with the clinical details before me. I felt torn, knowing that if I rushed this appointment, I might miss something important in her care, but if I waited too long to prepare my sermon, I risked disappointing my community. The expectations of both roles pulled at me, and I sat there, caught between the needs of my patient and the spiritual needs of my congregation, unsure which to give my full attention."}
