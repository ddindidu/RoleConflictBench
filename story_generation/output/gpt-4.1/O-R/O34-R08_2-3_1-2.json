The holiday rush has turned the airspace into a puzzle, and every decision I make ripples through the sky. My headset crackles with pilots\u2019 voices, each one hoping for a break in the congestion. I know the expectation: keep the airspace safe, minimize delays, and stay sharp\u2014lives depend on it.\n\nBut tonight, my community gathers for our Quran study circle. I promised I\u2019d be there, and I promised myself I\u2019d read the verses beforehand, to reflect and contribute meaningfully. The group expects me to be prepared, to share insights, to honor my faith with presence and thoughtfulness. Yet, I haven\u2019t opened the Quran all week, and the guilt gnaws at me.\n\nAs the clock ticks closer to the study circle, my mind splits. The radar demands my full attention, but my heart aches to fulfill my spiritual commitment. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting my best, and I sit at my console, torn, unable to move in either direction."}
