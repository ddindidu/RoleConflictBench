New drug approvals, updated guidelines\u2014my mind raced to keep up. I knew I had to stay sharp; patients depended on my knowledge. Just as I highlighted a section on a promising new anticoagulant, my phone buzzed. It was Brother Ahmed, a long-time congregant. His message was brief but heavy: \u201cImam, can we meet soon? My family is falling apart. I need your guidance.\u201d \n\nI stared at the screen, feeling the weight of his trust. As an imam, I was expected to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and wisdom. But as a pharmacist, I was expected to be current, to never let my expertise slip. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent in their own way. My heart pounded as I looked between the newsletter and my phone, torn by the impossible choice between professional responsibility and spiritual duty."}
