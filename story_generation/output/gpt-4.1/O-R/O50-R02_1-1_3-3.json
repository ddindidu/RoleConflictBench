Next week\u2019s shutdown was my window to clean and service the machines\u2014something I couldn\u2019t afford to miss. The factory depended on me to keep everything running smoothly, and I took pride in that responsibility. As I wiped the grease from my hands, my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Carter, a parishioner. She wondered if I might have time to talk, not urgently, but soon\u2014she\u2019d been feeling lost lately and needed some guidance.\n\nI felt the familiar tug between my two worlds. The factory expected me to be present, focused, and thorough, especially during the shutdown. But as a priest, I was supposed to be available, compassionate, and attentive to those who reached out. I could hear the hum of the machines in my mind, the echo of Mrs. Carter\u2019s gentle request in my heart. Both roles demanded my time, my presence, and my care. I stared at my calendar, feeling the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure how I could possibly meet them both."}
