When I opened the cupboard, my heart sank\u2014there was no more of the specialized granite cleaner, the one Mrs. Johnson insisted on for her countertops. I knew she expected me to manage these supplies, to let her know before anything ran out. I felt a knot of anxiety tighten in my stomach. \n\nJust then, I saw another cleaner, Mark, slip ahead of me in the supply room line, grabbing the last bottle of the cleaner I needed. He glanced at me, shrugged, and walked away. As a Hindu, I was raised to value honesty and fairness, to speak up when something isn\u2019t right. But as a cleaner, I was expected to keep the peace, avoid conflict, and never cause trouble at work. I stood there, torn between my duty to my job and my deeper sense of what was right, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
