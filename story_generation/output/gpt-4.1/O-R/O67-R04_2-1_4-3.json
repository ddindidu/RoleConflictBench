Dispatch reported a woman with a broken arm, pain sharp in her cries over the phone. As an ambulance driver, I knew I was closest\u2014my duty was clear: stabilize her, ease her pain, get her safely to the hospital. I grabbed my bag, heart pounding, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the Friday prayer was in less than an hour. As the imam, the congregation expected my presence, my words, my guidance. True, the guest speaker could step in, but many in the community looked to me for comfort and leadership, especially on Fridays. I could almost hear the disappointment in their voices if I wasn\u2019t there. My mind raced, torn between the immediate suffering of a patient and the spiritual needs of my community. The ambulance keys felt heavy in my hand, the weight of two worlds pressing down on me, each demanding I not let them down."}
