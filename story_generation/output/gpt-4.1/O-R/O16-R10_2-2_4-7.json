My patient, Mrs. Sharma, sat across from me, her eyes wide with worry as she clutched the pamphlet about her new diagnosis. She had so many questions\u2014about medication, diet, what to expect. I knew I needed to be patient, to explain everything clearly and with compassion, as any good doctor should. But my phone buzzed again: a reminder about the family puja for Navratri. My parents had called twice already, reminding me to come straight home, to be on time, to wear the new kurta they\u2019d bought for me. The ceremony was important, a chance to honor our traditions together. I felt torn, my mind pulled in two directions\u2014my duty to my patient, who needed my full attention, and my responsibility as a son and a Hindu, expected to be present and respectful at the family gathering. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on Mrs. Sharma\u2019s questions, but the pressure of both worlds pressed in, leaving me suspended between them, unsure which path to take."}
