My mind was focused on delivering instructions, every word measured and precise, when my clerk slipped me a note. The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was about to cite. My heart pounded. I knew I had to pause, review the new ruling, and adjust my instructions\u2014staying current with the law was not just expected, it was required.\n\nBut as the courtroom buzzed with confusion, my thoughts drifted to home. It was nearly dusk, the time I always set aside to light the lamp and offer prayers at my altar. My faith demanded this daily ritual, a moment of peace and connection. Yet here I was, torn between my duty to the law and my devotion to my faith. The pressure mounted\u2014could I fulfill both roles, or would one always come at the expense of the other? I stood frozen, the demands of judge and Hindu pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which path to take."}
