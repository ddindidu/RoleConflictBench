As a judge, I knew the expectation: every file deserved my full attention, no matter how routine the hearing seemed. Two weeks might sound like plenty, but my docket was packed, and I prided myself on never being unprepared. Yet, as I reached for the file, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014Friday\u2019s khutbah. The community had already announced my topic, and as the only imam this week, I couldn\u2019t let them down. They expected a thoughtful, inspiring sermon, not something hastily thrown together. My mind raced, torn between the silent demand of the case file and the echoing anticipation of the congregation. I felt the weight of both robes\u2014the black of the courtroom, the white of the mosque\u2014pressing on my shoulders. I stared at the file, then at my sermon notes, heart pounding, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both the attention they deserved."}
