He winced with every movement, and I knew I had to be extra gentle, supporting his weight and making sure he didn\u2019t slip. My mind was focused on his comfort, on the careful steps of dressing him, when my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Mrs. Carter, a parishioner. She wanted to know if I could talk soon\u2014she didn\u2019t say why, but her words sounded heavy, like she needed more than just a casual chat. \n\nAs a nursing assistant, my duty is to be present, attentive, and patient. But as a priest, I\u2019m expected to be available, to offer guidance and a listening ear, especially when someone reaches out. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. Mr. Thompson needed my hands and focus right now, but Mrs. Carter might need my heart and counsel. I could feel the tension rising inside me, torn between the immediate physical needs before me and the spiritual care I\u2019m called to provide. I stood there, holding Mr. Thompson\u2019s arm, my mind racing, unsure which need should come first."}
