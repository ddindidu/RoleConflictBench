As a police officer, I was expected to enforce the law, to respond to complaints like this one and ensure the peace was kept. But as I stepped out, my mind wandered to the envelope of savings tucked away at home\u2014money I\u2019d been setting aside for years, hoping to finally join my friends on Hajj this season. The cost of the pilgrimage was steep, and every overtime shift, every call like this, was supposed to bring me closer to fulfilling that sacred duty as a Muslim.\n\nTonight, though, the party was hosted by a close friend from the mosque, someone who had always supported my dream of going to Mecca. If I issued a citation, it could strain our relationship and possibly jeopardize the support I\u2019d need for my journey. But if I let it slide, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty as an officer, betraying the trust the community placed in me. My heart pounded as I stood at the door, torn between the badge on my chest and the faith in my heart, unsure which path to follow."}
