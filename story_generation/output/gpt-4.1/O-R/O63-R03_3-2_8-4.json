My telemarketing shift was relentless\u2014calls queued up, the automated system tracking every second. I knew the rules: breaks only at scheduled times, or the compliance system would flag me. My supervisor had warned me\u2014one more infraction, and I\u2019d face disciplinary action. But today, the convent was holding a special healing service for Sister Agnes, who had fallen gravely ill. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to pray and support my community, especially in moments like this. My heart ached with the weight of both worlds. If I left my desk now, I\u2019d risk my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d be absent from my sisters in their hour of need. The phone rang again, and I hesitated, torn between the demands of my faith and the rigid expectations of my job, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
