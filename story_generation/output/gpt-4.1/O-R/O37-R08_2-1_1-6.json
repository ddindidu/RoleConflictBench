The hotel expects spotless rooms, gleaming floors, and not a speck of dust left behind. I take pride in my work, knowing that guests rely on me for comfort and cleanliness. But as I scrub and polish, my mind drifts to my faith. As a Muslim, I am expected to perform Hajj at least once in my life. The thought fills me with longing and a sense of duty. Yet, my wages barely cover rent and food, let alone the cost of traveling to Mecca.\n\nLately, the hotel manager has increased our workload, expecting us to clean more rooms in less time. I find myself exhausted, with little energy left at the end of the day. I worry that if I slow down to save money or take extra shifts, I\u2019ll never save enough for Hajj. But if I focus on saving, I might not meet the hotel\u2019s high standards. The weight of these expectations presses on me, and I feel torn between my responsibilities at work and my spiritual obligation."}
