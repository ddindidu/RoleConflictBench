If I don\u2019t act now, the machine could seize, halting production and costing the company dearly. My hands itch to grab my tools, to dive into the familiar world of gears and grease, to do what I\u2019m trusted to do\u2014keep everything running smoothly. But my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s a message from Ahmed, a devoted member of my congregation. He\u2019s asking if I can meet him soon; his family is in turmoil, and he needs guidance, reassurance, perhaps even a prayer. As an imam, I am expected to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and wisdom when my community is in pain. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders\u2014the urgent, mechanical crisis before me, and the quiet, human crisis waiting just beyond these factory walls. My heart pounds as I stand between the shrieking machine and the silent plea for help, torn by the demands of metal and spirit, unsure which call to answer first."}
