The construction cones forced me closer to the curb, where a group of children waited, backpacks swinging, laughter ringing out. As a taxi driver, I knew the rules\u2014slow down, stay alert, protect the vulnerable. But the clock on the dashboard glared at me, reminding me of the Buddhist study circle tonight. I hadn\u2019t read the chapter yet, and the thought gnawed at me. My teacher expected thoughtful questions, mindful presence. I wanted to honor that, to deepen my practice, but the demands of the road pressed in. If I took the detour, I\u2019d be late for the circle. If I hurried, I\u2019d risk the safety of the children and betray my duty as a driver. My mind spun, torn between the world\u2019s urgency and the quiet call of reflection, feeling the weight of both roles pressing on my chest as I approached the school zone."}
