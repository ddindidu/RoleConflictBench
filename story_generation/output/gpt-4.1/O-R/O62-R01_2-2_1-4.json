As a lifeguard, I knew every second counted. Suddenly, I noticed a swimmer near the middle of the pool, their strokes faltering, head bobbing awkwardly. My muscles tensed, ready to leap in if needed. Just then, I felt a gentle tap on my shoulder. Turning, I saw Mrs. Carter, her eyes red and voice trembling. \u201cPastor, do you have a moment? I really need to talk. It\u2019s about my son\u2014he\u2019s in trouble again.\u201d Her pain was raw, and I knew she needed comfort, guidance, the kind of support I promised to give as her pastor. But my gaze kept flicking back to the struggling swimmer. I felt torn, the weight of both uniforms pressing on me. If I turned away from the pool, even for a moment, I might miss a life-or-death moment. But if I brushed Mrs. Carter off, I\u2019d be failing her in her hour of need. My heart pounded as I stood between the water and her pleading eyes, caught in the impossible pull of both callings."}
