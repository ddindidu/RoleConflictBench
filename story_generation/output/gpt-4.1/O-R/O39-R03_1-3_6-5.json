As a construction laborer, I was expected to pull my weight, follow every protocol, and never let the team down. The foreman posted a notice about an optional training session next week\u2014attendance wasn\u2019t mandatory, but everyone knew it was a chance to prove commitment and maybe earn more responsibility. I wanted to go, to show I belonged.\n\nBut as a nun, my life was shaped by a different rhythm. The convent expected me at daily prayers, and this week, I\u2019d been chosen to lead a prayer vigil at a major public event. It was an honor, a sign of trust from my sisters and a duty to my faith. The vigil was scheduled for the same day as the training. My heart twisted as I imagined the disappointment in my foreman\u2019s eyes if I missed the session, and the quiet hurt in my Mother Superior\u2019s voice if I failed the convent. I stood at the edge of the site, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of both hard hats and habits pressing down on me."}
