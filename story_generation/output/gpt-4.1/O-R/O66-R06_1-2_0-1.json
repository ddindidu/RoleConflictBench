He was in no rush, chatting about his upcoming lunch with friends. The city traffic was light, and I felt at ease, focused on getting him there safely and on time, just as any good taxi driver should. Then, at a red light, I noticed a man stumbling on the sidewalk, clearly drunk and struggling to stay upright. He looked lost, maybe even in danger of wandering into the street. My Christian conscience screamed at me to help, to show compassion and not just drive by. But as a taxi driver, I had a responsibility to my passenger\u2014he expected a smooth, uninterrupted ride, not an unexpected detour. My hands tightened on the wheel. Should I stop and risk inconveniencing my passenger, or keep driving and ignore the man in need? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I felt torn, caught in the tension between duty and faith."}
