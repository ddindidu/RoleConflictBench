My passenger, a nervous businessman, kept glancing at his watch and muttering about missing his flight. \u201cPlease, can\u2019t you go any faster?\u201d he pleaded, desperation in his voice. I wanted to reassure him, to fulfill my duty as a driver and get him to the airport safely and on time, but the roads were treacherous, and every instinct told me to be cautious.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from the convent: the sisters were gathering for a special healing service for Sister Agnes, who had taken a sudden turn for the worse. It was outside our usual schedule, but my presence was expected\u2014no, needed. I could almost hear Mother Superior\u2019s gentle voice reminding me of my vows, the importance of community, of prayer.\n\nMy heart pounded as I weighed the urgency of my passenger\u2019s journey against the call of my faith and my sisters. The storm outside was nothing compared to the turmoil inside me, torn between the road ahead and the sanctuary I longed to reach."}
