My manager\u2019s voice floated through the speakers, \u201cCan you give us your best estimate for the new module, please?\u201d I knew the session was informal, that the timeline could still shift, but I also knew my input mattered. I started to type out my thoughts, trying to balance optimism with realism.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from my friend in the sangha: \u201cDo you have time to talk about the sermon from yesterday? I\u2019m struggling to understand the teaching on non-attachment.\u201d I felt a tug in my chest. As a Buddhist, I wanted to be present, to listen deeply and help my friend reflect. But as an engineer, I was expected to focus, to provide clear, accurate estimates for the team.\n\nI stared at the two screens, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in. My mind raced, torn between the calm presence I aspired to and the analytical focus my job demanded. I closed my eyes, wishing I could be fully present for both, but knowing I had to choose."}
