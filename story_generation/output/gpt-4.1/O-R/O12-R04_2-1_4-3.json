My phone buzzed with messages from the product team, asking for my input before the afternoon meeting. The deadline was tight, and other teams were waiting on my technical decisions to move forward. At the same time, my mind kept drifting to the mosque. It was Friday, and as the imam, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah. The community looked forward to my words, and I knew how much they valued the connection and guidance I tried to offer each week. \n\nBut today, there was a guest speaker who had prepared a sermon and could step in if I needed. Still, I felt the weight of expectation from the congregation, the sense that my absence would be noticed. My heart pounded as I weighed the needs of my colleagues against the trust of my community. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I found myself caught between two worlds, each demanding a part of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
