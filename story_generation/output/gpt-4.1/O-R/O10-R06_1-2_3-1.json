My firm expects me to attend every seminar, especially one like this, where experts will discuss upcoming changes that could affect our clients. Missing it could mean falling behind, risking mistakes, and letting down my team. But the seminar is scheduled for Sunday morning, right during church service. As a Christian, I\u2019ve always valued worship and fellowship, believing that honoring God should come first. My pastor often reminds us that our faith should guide our priorities, not just fit around them. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing on me\u2014my professional duty to be diligent and compliant, and my spiritual commitment to live out my faith. I sit at my desk, staring at the seminar invitation, torn between the demands of my career and the convictions of my heart, unsure which path to take."}
