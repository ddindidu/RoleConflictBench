I glance at the blueprints spread across my desk, calculations and deadlines swirling in my mind. As the architect, I\u2019m expected to keep everything running smoothly, to anticipate problems and solve them before they grow. The team relies on my decisions, and the client expects results. Yet, tonight is the weekly Buddhist study circle\u2014a time I\u2019ve promised myself for spiritual reflection and learning. We\u2019re discussing a chapter I haven\u2019t even opened, and I know my presence matters to the group. My teacher always says that true understanding comes from showing up, from being present. But how can I be present when my mind is split? The weight of responsibility presses on my chest. I stare at the clock, feeling the tug of both worlds, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
