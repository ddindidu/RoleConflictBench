The Cohen family waited outside, their faces drawn with worry. I knew I had to deliver news that would shatter their world, and I rehearsed the words in my mind, searching for the right balance of honesty and compassion. As a doctor, I owed them clarity and empathy, but my thoughts kept drifting to home, where my son struggled with his Torah portion for his upcoming bar mitzvah. He needed me to guide him, to pass on the traditions and values that defined our family and faith. My wife\u2019s texts reminded me of my promise to help him tonight, but the hospital pager kept me tethered here. The expectations pressed in from both sides\u2014my patients needed my strength and presence, my son needed my patience and wisdom. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me, as I tried to reconcile the healer and the teacher within me, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
