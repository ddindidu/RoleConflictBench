My manager just called, asking for a preliminary design proposal by tomorrow, even though the project is still in its early stages. I know I could suggest alternative approaches later, but the expectation is clear: show initiative, deliver something concrete, keep the momentum going. My mind races with technical possibilities, but my calendar pings\u2014a gentle reminder of the weekly group meditation at the temple, starting in thirty minutes. As a Buddhist, I promised myself to honor this hour, to practice mindfulness and be present with my sangha. The thought of missing it fills me with guilt, as if I\u2019m betraying a deeper commitment to inner peace. Yet, the pressure to perform as an engineer tugs at me, whispering that I can\u2019t afford to step away, not even for an hour. My heart pounds, torn between the demands of my profession and the quiet sanctuary of meditation, each role pulling me in opposite directions."}
