My mind was already racing ahead to the family ceremony this morning\u2014an important puja that my parents had reminded me about all week. I was supposed to be home soon, dressed in my clean kurta, ready to light incense and chant prayers with everyone. But here, in the nursing home, my shift wasn\u2019t over. Mr. Thompson still needed help with his bath, and Mrs. Lee was waiting for her medication. My supervisor expected me to finish my rounds before leaving, and I knew how much the patients depended on me for their morning routines. Yet, the thought of missing the ceremony, of disappointing my family and neglecting my faith, gnawed at me. I felt torn, standing in the hallway, my hands still smelling faintly of soap, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward my patients who needed me, and toward my family and faith that called me home."}
