As a lawyer, I was expected to represent my client in a high-stakes jury trial starting tomorrow. The judge had made it clear\u2014no delays, no excuses. My client\u2019s future, and a significant sum of money, hung in the balance. Every moment of preparation mattered. Yet, as a priest, I was also responsible for leading the weekly religious education class for the children of my parish. Parents trusted me to guide their children, to nurture their faith and answer their questions. The class was scheduled for the same evening as the trial\u2019s opening arguments. I could already imagine the disappointment in the children\u2019s eyes if I canceled, and the frustration of my client if I was distracted or unprepared. My heart ached as I tried to reconcile these two worlds, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to yield. I stared at my calendar, torn between the courtroom and the church, feeling the impossible pull of duty from both sides."}
