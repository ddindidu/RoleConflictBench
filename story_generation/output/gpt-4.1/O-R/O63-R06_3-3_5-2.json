My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe need three more sales, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d My fingers hovered over the phone, the script open in front of me. I\u2019d already called Mrs. Thompson twice this week. She was elderly, living alone, and always so polite, even when she said she couldn\u2019t afford our insurance plan. Management said to \u201cpush the benefits, not the costs,\u201d but I knew what that meant\u2014skirt the truth, make it sound like a necessity. \n\nAs a Christian, I\u2019d always promised myself I\u2019d be honest, never take advantage of anyone, especially the vulnerable.
