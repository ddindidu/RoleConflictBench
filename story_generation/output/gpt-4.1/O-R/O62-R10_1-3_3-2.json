My first task as a lifeguard was to check the equipment and make sure everything was in order. As I walked along the poolside, I noticed a few chairs were slightly out of place. They weren\u2019t blocking any paths, and no one was around yet, but I knew the facility expected everything to be perfectly aligned. I glanced at my watch\u2014my morning puja was about to begin. As a Hindu, I never missed my daily prayers, chanting, and offerings. The ritual brought me peace and a sense of connection, but it was precise and time-consuming. I felt the pressure mounting: should I quickly fix the chairs and risk being late for my prayers, or start my ritual on time and leave the chairs for later, possibly disappointing my supervisor? The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, and I stood there, torn, the pool silent except for the gentle lapping of water."}
