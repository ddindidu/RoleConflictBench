My break was scheduled for another hour, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight\u2019s minyan at the synagogue. I\u2019d promised my father I\u2019d be there, and I knew how much it meant to him\u2014and to me\u2014to keep that commitment. But the compliance system at work was ruthless; even a few minutes of unscheduled downtime could mean a warning, maybe worse. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cStick to your schedule, no exceptions.\u201d I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The expectation to be a reliable team member, to not let my coworkers down, clashed with the pull of my faith and community. My heart pounded as I weighed the risk of slipping away early against the guilt of missing the service. I sat frozen, torn between the demands of my job and the call of my tradition, not sure which part of myself I\u2019d have to disappoint."}
