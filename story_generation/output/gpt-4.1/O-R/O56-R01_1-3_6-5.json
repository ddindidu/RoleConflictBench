She smiled, mentioning she\u2019d just washed her hair at home. Her hair felt clean, but the salon\u2019s policy\u2014and my training\u2014insisted I wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before cutting. I could hear my manager\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me of the importance of consistency and hygiene. Yet, as I gently combed through her hair, my phone buzzed in my pocket. A message from the church council flashed on the screen: a family in our congregation had lost their home in a fire last night. They needed immediate support, someone to pray with them, to organize meals and shelter. My heart ached for them, and I felt the weight of my calling as a pastor. But here I was, expected to focus on my client, to follow salon protocol, to provide the best service. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt torn\u2014between the rules of my profession and the urgent needs of my community."}
