The defendant\u2019s family waits anxiously for my order, and the law is clear: I must draft and sign the release conditions without delay. My clerk reminds me that the defendant cannot be released until my signature is on the page. The pressure to be thorough and precise weighs on me\u2014every word matters, every detail must be right.\n\nBut my stomach growls, reminding me I haven\u2019t eaten since dawn. I glance at the clock; it\u2019s nearly sundown. I remember the small kosher vendor nearby, the only place I can eat without compromising my faith. If I don\u2019t go now, I\u2019ll miss my chance for a kosher meal today. Yet, if I leave, the defendant remains in custody, and I fail in my duty to provide timely justice. My mind races, torn between my commitment to the law and my devotion to my faith, each demanding something I cannot give to both at once."}
