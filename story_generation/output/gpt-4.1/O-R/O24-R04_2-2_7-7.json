The new appellate decision he cited could shift the entire direction of the case, and as a judge, I knew I had to review it thoroughly before tomorrow\u2019s session. The law demanded my diligence, my impartiality, my constant vigilance to stay current. Yet, as I reached for the case file, my phone buzzed with a message from a long-time congregant. He pleaded for a private meeting tonight, his family life unraveling, his faith shaken. As his imam, I was his guide, his confidant, the one he trusted to help him find peace. My heart ached at the thought of turning him away, but the weight of the court\u2019s expectations pressed down on me. I stared at the legal documents, then at my phone, torn between the demands of justice and the needs of the soul. The clock ticked on, and I felt the tension coil tighter within me, knowing I could not be in two places at once, yet both roles called to me with equal urgency."}
