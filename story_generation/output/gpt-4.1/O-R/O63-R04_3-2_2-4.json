I\u2019ve been with your company for years!\u201d My script fluttered uselessly in my hand. As a telemarketer, I was trained to handle objections, to reassure, to explain every detail until the customer felt safe. But my eyes kept darting to the clock. In less than an hour, I was expected at the mosque, where I was the only imam scheduled to deliver the Friday sermon. The topic\u2014\u201cHonesty in Daily Life\u201d\u2014had been announced all week. The congregation would be waiting, expecting guidance, expecting me. My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t let a customer go unsatisfied.\u201d But the community\u2019s trust was also at stake. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on Mr. Rahman\u2019s questions, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait."}
