They weren\u2019t blocking any paths, but I knew part of my duty as a lifeguard was to keep everything orderly and safe. I reached down to straighten one, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Brother Ahmed, a long-time congregant. He sounded desperate\u2014his family was going through a crisis, and he needed to talk to me as soon as possible. As the imam, I knew how much he relied on my guidance, especially in moments like this. I looked at the chairs, then at the phone in my hand, feeling the weight of both roles pressing on me. The pool needed to be ready for the evening rush, but Ahmed\u2019s voice in my mind reminded me that spiritual support couldn\u2019t wait. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the quiet order of the pool and the urgent needs of my community."}
