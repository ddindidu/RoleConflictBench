Just then, a client stormed out of the chair, her voice rising above the hum of the dryers. \u201cThis is not what I asked for!\u201d she shouted, glaring at her reflection. My training as a hairdresser told me to stay calm, listen, and do whatever I could to make her happy, even if it meant staying late. My coworkers glanced over, anxious to leave, but I knew I couldn\u2019t ignore her complaint.\n\nAs I tried to soothe her, I noticed another customer quietly slipping ahead in the line to pay, bypassing someone who had been waiting patiently. My heart twinged. As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma\u2014righteousness and fairness\u2014even in small moments. I felt the urge to speak up, to gently point out the unfairness, but the angry client demanded my full attention. Torn between my duty to my client and my moral responsibility, I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which voice to listen to first."}
