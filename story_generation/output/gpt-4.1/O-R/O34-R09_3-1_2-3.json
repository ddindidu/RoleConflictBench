A sudden route closure has thrown the airspace into chaos, and every second counts. My headset crackles with urgent voices, pilots needing instructions, colleagues relaying updates. I\u2019m trained for this, to keep calm, to keep everyone safe. My stomach growls, reminding me I haven\u2019t eaten since dawn. I reach for my lunch bag, knowing the pantry is stocked with kosher food, as always. But the pressure is relentless; I barely have time to breathe, let alone step away for a meal. The expectation is clear: I must manage this congestion, stay at my post, and not let my focus waver. Yet my faith calls me to pause, to eat only what is permitted, to honor the rituals that ground me. The clock ticks, the blips multiply, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to the skies, and my duty to something higher."}
