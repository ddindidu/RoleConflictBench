She\u2019d just learned her cancer had returned, and the weight of her grief filled the hallway. As a nursing assistant, I knew my place was by her side, offering comfort and a listening ear. My shift was nearly over, but I couldn\u2019t ignore her pain. Yet, tonight was the annual memorial service at the temple\u2014a sacred Buddhist ceremony honoring ancestors. My teacher had asked me to help prepare the altar, and the community expected my presence. I felt the tug of both worlds: the hospital\u2019s quiet suffering and the temple\u2019s solemn gathering. My heart ached with the urge to stay with Mrs. Lee, to hold her hand and let her know she wasn\u2019t alone. At the same time, I felt the pull of my Buddhist vows, the importance of ritual, and the collective spirit of my sangha. I stood frozen, torn between the bedside and the altar, the needs of one soul and the expectations of many."}
