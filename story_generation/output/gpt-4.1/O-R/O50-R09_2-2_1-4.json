The supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford more downtime. Find the problem, fast.\u201d I knelt beside the machine, tools in hand, mind racing through possible causes for the sensor errors. Thirty minutes had already passed, and the pressure to get the line running again was suffocating. My stomach growled, reminding me I hadn\u2019t eaten since dawn. I glanced at my watch\u2014if I didn\u2019t eat soon, I\u2019d be running on fumes for the rest of the shift.\n\nBut the only food nearby was from a small vendor I\u2019d researched before the trip, the only one with a reliable kosher certification. If I left now, I could grab a quick meal and keep my commitment to kashrut. But the expectation to fix the machine immediately pressed down on me. If I left, the team would be frustrated, the supervisor disappointed, and production would fall even further behind. If I stayed, I\u2019d be hungry, distracted, and betraying my own values. My hands hovered over the open panel, torn between the demands of my job and my faith, heart pounding as I weighed what to do next."}
