Instinctively, I slowed the train, my mind racing through the safety protocols I\u2019d memorized. Over the intercom, a panicked voice reported a passenger had collapsed. My duty as an operator was clear: ensure everyone\u2019s safety, coordinate with emergency services, and keep the situation calm. As I prepared to make the necessary announcements, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from a parishioner. She asked if I could find time soon to talk, hinting at a struggle she was facing. As a priest, I knew how much courage it took to reach out, and I felt the weight of her need for guidance. But right now, dozens of passengers depended on me for their safety. My hands hovered over the controls, my mind torn between the immediate crisis before me and the quiet plea for help waiting in my inbox. The expectations of both roles pressed in, each urgent in its own way, and I felt myself caught in the impossible space between them."}
