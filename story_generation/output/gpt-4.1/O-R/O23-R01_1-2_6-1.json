I felt the weight of my oath\u2014client confidentiality was non-negotiable, even in casual conversation. Before I could answer, another member of my congregation, eyes red-rimmed, tugged at my sleeve. \u201cPastor, can we talk? I\u2019m at a crossroads and need your guidance.\u201d My mind raced. As a lawyer, I was expected to guard secrets fiercely, never letting slip even the smallest detail. As a pastor, I was called to be open, compassionate, and present, offering wisdom and comfort. The two roles pressed in on me, their demands clashing in the space between my heart and mind. I could feel the tension rising, the expectations of both worlds pulling me in opposite directions. I took a breath, searching for the right words, knowing that whatever I said next would define which part of myself I honored in that moment."}
