As a construction laborer, I know the rules: every worker must sweep their area, leaving it spotless and safe for the next crew. My supervisor\u2019s eyes are sharp, and I\u2019ve seen men lose hours of pay for skipping this final task. But today, my phone buzzes with reminders from the mosque committee\u2014Friday prayers are in less than an hour, and the community expects me, their imam, to deliver a sermon marking a milestone in our congregation\u2019s history. People have come from distant towns, eager for words of guidance and celebration. My boots are caked with mud, my hands rough, and my heart pounds with the weight of both worlds. If I stay to clean, I risk arriving late, letting down those who look to me for spiritual leadership. If I leave now, I betray the trust of my coworkers and compromise the safety I\u2019m responsible for. The broom handle feels heavy in my grip as I stand at the crossroads of duty, torn between the dust of the earth and the call to prayer."}
