The project manager\u2019s message echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t move forward until your part is done.\u201d I knew the team was waiting, their progress stalled, and the deadline loomed closer with every passing hour. As an engineer, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down on me\u2014my work was the linchpin for everyone else.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed with a reminder: Sunday service in an hour. I remembered the warmth of the congregation, the sense of belonging, and the peace I found in worship. As a Christian, I believed in honoring God with my time, in being present for my church family, and in nurturing my faith through regular attendance.\n\nMy heart pounded as I glanced between the unfinished code and my Bible on the desk.

The clock ticked on, and I sat there, wrestling with the impossible choice between my duty to my team and my commitment to my spiritual life."}
