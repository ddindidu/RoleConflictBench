She smiled weakly, and I sat beside her, holding her hand, offering the comfort and companionship she needed. My role as a nursing assistant was clear: be present, listen, and make her feel cared for. As we talked, I noticed through the open door that another staff member quietly let a visitor cut in line at the medication window. It was a small thing, but my upbringing as a Hindu reminded me of the importance of dharma\u2014doing what is right, standing up for fairness and honesty, even in small matters. I felt a tug inside me, the urge to gently address the situation, to uphold the ethical principles I value. But Mrs. Patel\u2019s grip tightened, her voice trembling as she shared a memory. I was torn\u2014should I stay and give her the support she needed, or step away to address the minor injustice I had witnessed? The expectations of both roles pressed on me, and I sat there, heart pounding, caught between two worlds."}
