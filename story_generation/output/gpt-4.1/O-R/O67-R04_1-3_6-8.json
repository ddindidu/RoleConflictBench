My mind was focused on the responsibility of driving safely\u2014no shortcuts, no distractions, just the steady hum of the engine and the weight of the vehicle in my hands. As I pulled up to the mosque, intending to park the ambulance before my next shift, I saw a familiar face at the entrance. It was Brother Ahmed, his shoulders slumped, eyes red with grief. He rushed toward me, voice trembling, \u201cImam, please, I need you. I just lost my father. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d \n\nIn that moment, the expectations of both my worlds collided. As an ambulance driver, I was expected to deliver the vehicle safely and on time, ensuring it was ready for emergencies. As an imam, I was called to offer comfort, guidance, and a listening ear to someone in deep pain. My heart ached as I stood there, torn between the duty to my colleagues and the urgent need of a grieving soul before me."}
