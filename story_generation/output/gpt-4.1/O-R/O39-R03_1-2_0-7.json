The supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cMove those materials before you clock out.\u201d I glanced at the sun, already dipping low, and calculated how much time I had left. My muscles ached, but I knew I could finish if I pushed myself. Then my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from Sister Agnes. \u201cMaria, Mrs. Lopez needs to see you. She\u2019s struggling and asked for your guidance this evening.\u201d My heart twisted. As a nun, I was expected to offer comfort and spiritual counsel, to be present for those in need. But as a laborer, I was expected to finish my shift strong, to not let the team down. I stared at the stack of materials, then at the chapel across the street, feeling the pull of both worlds. The demands pressed in on me, heavy as the blocks in my hands, and I stood there, torn, unsure which duty to answer first."}
