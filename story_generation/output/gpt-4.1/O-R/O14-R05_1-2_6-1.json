As the lead scientist, it was my responsibility to ensure every piece of equipment was checked, every safety protocol followed, even if nothing seemed amiss. The checklist was due soon, and I knew skipping it, even once, could set a dangerous precedent. Yet, as I glanced at my calendar, my heart tightened. Shabbat was approaching, and as the community\u2019s rabbi, I was expected to deliver a thoughtful sermon\u2014one that would inspire and comfort. I hadn\u2019t even begun to prepare. My mind raced with Torah passages and scientific procedures, each demanding my full attention. I felt the weight of my lab coat and the rabbinic mantle pressing down on me, each tugging in a different direction. If I focused on the lab, I\u2019d neglect my congregation. If I poured myself into the sermon, I\u2019d risk the safety standards I\u2019d worked so hard to uphold. The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, torn between the two worlds that defined me."}
