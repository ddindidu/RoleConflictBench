The results were clear, and I knew I should document them now, while the details were fresh in my mind. As a scientist, accuracy and timeliness in reporting findings were not just professional standards\u2014they were a matter of integrity. Still, the logs could technically wait until later; the schedule was flexible, and no one would notice a short delay.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. A message from the mosque: someone had arrived, desperate for guidance after a devastating loss. As the imam, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and spiritual counsel in moments like these. My community relied on me to be available, to listen, to help them find solace in faith.\n\nI stared at the data on my screen, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Each demanded my full attention, each held its own urgency. My heart ached for the grieving individual, but my mind nagged at the responsibility to my research. I closed my eyes, torn between the call of science and the call of faith, unsure which path to take first."}
