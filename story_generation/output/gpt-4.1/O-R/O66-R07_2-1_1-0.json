My train leaves soon,\u201d he pleaded, his voice tight with worry. I nodded, feeling the weight of his urgency. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to get people where they need to go, safely and on time. But tonight, the traffic was thick, and the route to the station cut right through the heart of the city. My mind flickered to the temple bell that would soon ring, calling the community together for the evening chant. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to join, to be present, to help create the calm and unity that our rituals bring. I could already picture the soft glow of candles, the gentle hum of voices, the peace I always found there. But here I was, hands gripping the wheel, torn between the anxious man in my back seat and the quiet sanctuary waiting for me. The city lights blurred as I wrestled with the demands of both worlds, my heart pounding with the pressure of choosing which expectation to honor."}
