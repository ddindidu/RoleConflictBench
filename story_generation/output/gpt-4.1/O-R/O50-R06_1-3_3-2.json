As the lead machine repairer, everyone counted on me to keep the lines running smoothly. The routine servicing was critical\u2014if I missed anything, the machines could break down, costing the company thousands. My supervisor reminded me, \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any mistakes. Double-check everything.\u201d\n\nBut just as I was about to leave, I overheard two coworkers talking in hushed voices. They were planning to falsify maintenance records to cover up a shortcut they\u2019d taken last month. If I reported them, it could cost them their jobs. If I stayed silent, I\u2019d be complicit in a lie, betraying my Christian values of honesty and integrity. My heart pounded as I thought about the expectations on both sides: the company needed my technical expertise and thoroughness, but my faith demanded truthfulness above all.\n\nI felt torn, caught between my responsibility as a repairer and my commitment as a Christian. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I stood there, wrestling with what to do next."}
