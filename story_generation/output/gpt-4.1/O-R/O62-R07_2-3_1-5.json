My shift overlaps with the weekly meditation group I lead, and today, the pool is especially busy. I promised the group a guided session, and they\u2019re gathering in the quiet room just down the hall, waiting for me to begin. But here, on the pool deck, my duty is clear: every swimmer\u2019s safety depends on my vigilance. Suddenly, I notice a young swimmer in the middle of the pool, flailing, their strokes growing frantic. My heart pounds. I know I should be fully present, ready to leap in if needed. Yet, I also feel the tug of my Buddhist commitment\u2014my group expects me to guide them, to help them find calm and clarity. The demands pull at me from both sides, and I feel my breath catch, torn between the urgent needs of the present moment and the quiet sanctuary I promised to create."}
