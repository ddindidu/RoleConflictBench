The project planning session was running late, and my manager kept circling back to me for more precise time estimates. As an engineer, I knew how important it was to be present, to contribute, and to show my commitment to the team\u2014even if the session was informal and the timeline still flexible. But as the minutes ticked by, my mind drifted to the small altar in my living room. Every evening, I set aside time to light a lamp and offer prayers, a ritual that grounds me and connects me to my faith as a Hindu. My mother\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo matter how busy you are, never skip your prayers.\u201d Yet here I was, torn between the expectations of my profession and the quiet demands of my spiritual life. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my heart pounding as I weighed the importance of being a reliable engineer against the comfort and duty of my daily ritual."}
