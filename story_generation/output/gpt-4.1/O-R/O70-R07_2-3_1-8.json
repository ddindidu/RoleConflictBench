The customer\u2019s address was still fifteen minutes away, and the delivery window was closing fast. I knew how much they needed these groceries for dinner\u2014my job demanded punctuality, accuracy, and a smile at the door. But my mind kept drifting to the temple, to the teachings I was supposed to summarize for tomorrow\u2019s session. My teacher\u2019s message was gentle but clear: \u201cPlease reflect deeply and share your understanding with the sangha.\u201d I could almost hear the quiet of the meditation hall, the expectation that I would bring insight and presence, not just hurried words. My heart raced as I weighed the urgency of the delivery against the quiet call of spiritual responsibility. I felt torn, the van\u2019s engine humming beneath my indecision, as if the world was asking me to be in two places at once."}
