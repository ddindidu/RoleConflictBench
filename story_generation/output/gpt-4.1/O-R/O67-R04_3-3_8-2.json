The patient in the back was barely conscious, the paramedic\u2019s voice tense as he monitored the vitals. Every instinct told me to slow down, to drive with utmost caution on these slick, treacherous roads. But the hospital was still miles away, and time was slipping through my fingers. My phone buzzed on the dashboard\u2014a message from the mosque committee. The special remembrance was about to begin, and the congregation was waiting. No one else could lead the prayer; they needed me. I pictured the rows of worshippers, their trust in me as their imam, their expectation that I would guide them in this sacred moment. My heart pounded, torn between the duty to deliver this patient safely and the spiritual responsibility to my community. The storm raged outside and within me, each role demanding all of me, and I felt the weight of both pressing down, forcing me to choose."}
