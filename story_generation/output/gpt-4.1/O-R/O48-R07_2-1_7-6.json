She looked at me with wide, anxious eyes, and I could sense her fear. As a nursing assistant, I knew I should sit with her, offer comfort, and listen to her worries. She needed someone to be present, to reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone in this sterile, unfamiliar place.\n\nJust as I pulled up a chair, my phone buzzed. It was my friend from the temple, asking if I could join a video call to discuss the sermon we\u2019d heard last night. As a Buddhist, I value these moments of reflection and spiritual growth, and my friend was counting on me to share insights and deepen our understanding together.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me. Mrs. Lee\u2019s anxious gaze pleaded for my attention, while my friend\u2019s message reminded me of my commitment to spiritual practice. My heart ached as I stood between these two worlds, uncertain which path to follow in this moment."}
