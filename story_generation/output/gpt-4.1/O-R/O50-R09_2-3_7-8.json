Every time he did, the material waste piled up, and I knew my job was to step in, guide him, and prevent further loss. My supervisor expected me to be proactive, to teach the staff so these mistakes wouldn\u2019t keep happening. Just as I was about to approach him, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the synagogue: a funeral prayer was about to begin, and they needed one more person to make the minyan. I could almost hear the urgency in the text\u2014being present for these prayers is a deep responsibility in my community, a mitzvah I\u2019ve always tried to honor. I looked at the operator, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My hands hovered, uncertain, as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
