The workshop on updated prescription guidelines was running late, and the Q&A session had just begun. As a pharmacist, I knew how crucial it was to stay current\u2014patients depended on my knowledge, and I prided myself on giving the best advice. But as the clock ticked closer to noon, my mind drifted to the mosque. Today was Friday, and as the imam, the congregation expected me to deliver the Khutbah. I had spent hours preparing my sermon, but a guest speaker was also ready, just in case. The community valued my presence and guidance, especially on important topics I had planned to address. I felt torn\u2014my duty to my patients and my responsibility to my congregation collided. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each vital in its own way. I sat in the workshop, wrestling with the decision, feeling the expectations of two worlds pulling me apart."}
