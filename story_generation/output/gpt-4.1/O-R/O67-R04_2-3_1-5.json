As an ambulance driver, I knew every second mattered. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, ready to navigate the city\u2019s midday traffic. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was the Friday sermon, and not just any sermon. The mosque was full, people had come from distant towns, all expecting me, their imam, to deliver words of guidance on this special day. I pictured the congregation, their hopeful faces, the trust they placed in me. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds\u2014one life in pain, waiting for my siren; a community in anticipation, waiting for my voice. Duty pulled me in two directions, each demand urgent, each expectation heavy. I sat frozen for a moment, torn between the wail of the ambulance and the call to prayer, knowing that whatever I chose, something vital would be left behind."}
