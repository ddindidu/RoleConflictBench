My patient sits across from me, her hands trembling as she describes the pain that\u2019s returned, worse than before. She needs me to review her complex treatment plan, adjust her medications, and offer reassurance. I know this will take time\u2014careful, focused time. Yet, in less than fifteen minutes, I am supposed to lead the weekly meditation group at the temple. They expect me to be present, calm, and centered, guiding them through mindfulness practices that I myself desperately need. My mind races, torn between the duty to my patient\u2019s health and the commitment to my sangha. I feel the tension in my chest, the pull of compassion in two directions. I want to be fully present for both, but the clock ticks on, and I realize I cannot split myself in two."}
