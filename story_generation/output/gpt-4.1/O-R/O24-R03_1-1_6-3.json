As a judge, I am expected to stay current, to ensure my rulings reflect the most recent developments. I feel the familiar pull of intellectual curiosity and professional duty, my fingers itching to turn the first page. But the chapel bell tolls, echoing through the stone halls\u2014a gentle yet insistent reminder of my life as a nun. Morning prayer is not optional; it is a sacred rhythm, a communal act of devotion that shapes our days. My sisters are already gathering, their footsteps soft on the flagstones. I stand at the threshold, torn. The law demands my diligence, the convent my presence. Both worlds expect my full attention, but in this moment, I can only choose one. My heart aches with the weight of divided loyalties, the journal and the chapel each calling me in different languages of duty."}
