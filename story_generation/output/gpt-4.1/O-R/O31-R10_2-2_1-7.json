As a police officer, I was expected to keep the peace, to step in as the protest grew louder, tempers flaring between rival groups. My training told me to stay alert, to be ready for anything. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from my mother about the family puja, the one ceremony I promised never to miss. I could almost smell the incense, hear the chants, feel the warmth of my family waiting for me in their finest clothes. The expectation was clear: I should be there, dressed in traditional attire, honoring my faith and my family. But here I was, torn between duty and devotion, watching the crowd and feeling the weight of both uniforms\u2014the khaki and the kurta\u2014pressing down on me. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, caught between the law I swore to uphold and the traditions that shaped my soul."}
