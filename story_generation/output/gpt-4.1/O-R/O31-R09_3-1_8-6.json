As a police officer, I\u2019m expected to act with integrity, to provide honest testimony whenever called upon. The court date was set for Friday evening\u2014right at the start of Shabbat. My rabbi always says that our presence at synagogue is a way of honoring our faith and community, but I know the minyan will be met even if I\u2019m not there. Still, I feel the weight of my absence, as if I\u2019m letting down something sacred. My captain expects me to be there in uniform, ready to speak the truth. My family expects me to be at the synagogue, sharing in the prayers and rituals that have shaped us for generations. I can feel the tension in my chest, pulled between my duty to uphold the law and my devotion to my faith. The clock ticks on, and I stare at the two symbols in my hands, unsure which path to follow."}
