As her doctor, I knew I had to be honest and gentle, explaining the risks and the reality of her health. She listened quietly, then hesitated before asking, \u201cDo you think I can go for Hajj this year? My family says it\u2019s now or never.\u201d My heart clenched. As a Muslim, I understood the deep longing for pilgrimage, the spiritual fulfillment it brings. But as her doctor, I saw the medical risks, the strain such a journey could place on her fragile heart. I felt the weight of her hope and my responsibility. My mind raced with the expectations of my profession\u2014to protect her health, to communicate clearly, to be empathetic. Yet, my faith urged me to support her spiritual journey, knowing how precious this chance was. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding something different, and I sat there, torn, searching for the right words as she waited for my answer."}
