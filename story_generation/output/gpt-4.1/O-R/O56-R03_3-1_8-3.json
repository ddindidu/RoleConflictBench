The buildup is worse than I expected\u2014sticky, stubborn, and impossible to comb through without a thorough wash and condition. My scissors will snag if I don\u2019t do it right, and she\u2019s counting on me to make her look her best for her granddaughter\u2019s graduation. But as I massage the shampoo into her scalp, the convent bell tolls, echoing through the street and into my bones. Morning prayer is starting. I\u2019m expected in the chapel, kneeling with my sisters, reciting psalms and centering my heart in devotion. My mind races: if I leave now, I let down Mrs. Carter and risk my reputation as a hairdresser. If I stay, I miss prayer, breaking the sacred rhythm of my life as a nun. The weight of scissors in one hand and rosary beads in the other presses on me, and I feel torn, suspended between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each a part of who I am."}
