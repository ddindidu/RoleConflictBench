As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce every safety rule, no exceptions. That\u2019s when I saw him\u2014a small boy, flailing in the deep end, where kids weren\u2019t allowed without a swim test. My training screamed at me to act, to blow the whistle, to leap in if needed. But just as I tensed to move, I caught sight of Mrs. Carter, sitting alone on the bleachers, her face streaked with silent tears. As her pastor, I knew she\u2019d come here for solace, hoping for a gentle word or a prayer. My heart twisted. The rules demanded my full attention on the pool, but my calling urged me to comfort her. I felt torn, the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both at once."}
