My morning rounds had just begun, and I needed to take Mrs. Carter\u2019s vital signs before breakfast.

But as I reached her door, my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes: the community was gathering for a special healing service in the chapel, praying for Sister Maria, who had taken a sudden turn for the worse. My heart twisted. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to pray and support my sisters, especially in moments of crisis.
