Suddenly, a red alert flashed: brake system malfunction. My training as a subway operator kicked in\u2014protocol demanded I report the issue and bring the train to an immediate stop, no matter the inconvenience to passengers. Safety first, always. But as I reached for the radio, I heard a commotion in the next car. Through the window, I saw a young man, clearly distressed, clutching a Bible and praying aloud. I overheard enough to realize he was on his way to see his dying mother, desperate to reach the hospital in time. My heart twisted. As a Christian, I believe in compassion, in doing what I can to help others in their hour of need. Yet my duty as an operator was clear: I couldn\u2019t risk the lives of everyone on board for one person\u2019s emergency. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I found myself frozen, torn between the rules of my job and the call of my faith."}
