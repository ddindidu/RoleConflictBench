My manager\u2019s message was clear\u2014fix it before tomorrow\u2019s release. I felt the pressure mounting, knowing the team was counting on me to deliver clean, efficient code. As I was about to dive back into debugging, I noticed a message from a colleague, Sarah. She sounded upset, asking if I had a moment to talk. I remembered her father was in the hospital, and she\u2019d been struggling lately. As a Christian, I knew I should show compassion, listen, and offer support, just as Jesus taught. But the clock was ticking, and every minute spent away from my code meant risking the team\u2019s trust and the project\u2019s success. My heart ached as I weighed the demands\u2014be the reliable developer my team needed, or be the caring friend my faith called me to be. I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, unsure which to choose."}
