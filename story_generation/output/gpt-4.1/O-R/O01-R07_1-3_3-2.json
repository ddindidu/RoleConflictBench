As an architect, I knew every inch mattered\u2014each wall, each window, each door had to serve a purpose. The renovation was simple, but I wanted it to be perfect, functional, a space where I could work and live with ease. My mind raced with ideas, but my phone buzzed, breaking my focus. A message from the monastery: \u201cFestival preparations begin at dawn. We need your help.\u201d \n\nAs a Buddhist, the annual festival was sacred\u2014a time for community, for selflessness, for honoring tradition. I was expected to be there, to chant, to cook, to sweep, to serve. But the renovation deadline loomed, and I had promised myself I\u2019d finish the sketches tonight. My heart tugged in two directions: the quiet duty to my craft, and the call to serve my spiritual family. I stared at the unfinished lines on my paper, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to answer first."}
