I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift was nearly over, and I had planned to start outlining ideas for my upcoming Shabbat sermon tonight. I knew she wanted more than a quick answer; she valued my advice and often shared her worries. As a pharmacist, I was expected to provide thorough counseling, to listen and guide her through her options. But as a rabbi, I felt the weight of my congregation\u2019s expectations, the need to craft a meaningful message that would resonate weeks from now. My mind tugged in two directions: the immediate need to support Mrs. Goldstein, and the looming responsibility to inspire my community. I felt the tension rising in my chest, torn between the call to serve in the moment and the duty to prepare for the future."}
