My training as a police officer kicked in: adrenaline surged, mind sharpened, every instinct screaming to respond, to protect, to enforce the law. I reached for my holster, already picturing the scene\u2014innocent lives at risk, chaos threatening to spill into the streets. But as I started toward the door, my phone buzzed. A young couple, voices trembling with hope, asked if I could officiate their wedding next year. As a rabbi, I knew how much this meant to them\u2014the sanctity of their union, the trust they placed in me to guide them through a sacred moment. I heard the desperation in their voices, the need for reassurance, for spiritual presence. My heart twisted, torn between the immediate call to action and the long-term commitment to my community\u2019s spiritual life. The weight of both uniforms pressed down on me, each demanding my full self, each impossible to ignore. I stood frozen, caught between the siren\u2019s wail and the quiet plea for blessing, uncertain which duty to answer first."}
