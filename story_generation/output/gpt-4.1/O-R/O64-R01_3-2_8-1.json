My smile feels plastered on, but I keep it up, even as the woman in front of me raises her voice about a coupon that won\u2019t scan. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am, let me try again,\u201d I say, my tone gentle, though my heart pounds. I know the store expects me to stay calm, to be the face of patience, especially now, with holiday stress thick in the air.\n\nJust then, I spot Deacon Harris at the end of the line, his eyes red-rimmed.
