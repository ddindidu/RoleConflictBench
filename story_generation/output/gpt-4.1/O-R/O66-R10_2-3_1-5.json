Can you get me to the station fast?\u201d he pleaded. As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get him there safely and on time, and I felt the pressure mounting. I took a shortcut through a narrow lane, hoping to save precious minutes. Suddenly, I saw a group of men roughing up a street vendor, snatching his money and pushing him to the ground. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act when I saw injustice. But the passenger\u2019s voice broke through my thoughts, \u201cPlease, hurry!\u201d I gripped the steering wheel, torn between my duty to my passenger and my responsibility to intervene. The seconds ticked by, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, demanding action in opposite directions."}
