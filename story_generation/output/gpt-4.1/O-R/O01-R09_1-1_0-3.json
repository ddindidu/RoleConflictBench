As an architect, I knew my responsibility was to ensure every detail met safety codes, even if these small errors seemed unlikely to cause immediate harm. My supervisor, pressed for time, had hinted that I should let it go\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d he\u2019d said, \u201cwe need to move forward.\u201d The weight of professional integrity pressed on me.\n\nMy stomach rumbled, reminding me it was nearly lunchtime. I reached for a snack, automatically checking the label for kosher certification. As a Jew, I was diligent about keeping kosher, even when others around me didn\u2019t understand or thought it unnecessary.
