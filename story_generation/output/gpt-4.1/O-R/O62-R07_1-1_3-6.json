They weren\u2019t blocking any paths, but I knew the facility expected everything to be orderly. I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014equipment and appearance mattered, even if the chairs were still usable. As I moved to straighten them, my phone buzzed. It was Tenzin, my friend from the temple. He wanted to talk about the sermon we\u2019d heard last night, about impermanence and letting go of attachment. He said he needed my thoughts, maybe even some guidance. I looked at the chairs, then at my phone, feeling the tension rise. The pool demanded my attention, my diligence. But my heart longed for the quiet reflection and connection that my Buddhist practice offered. I stood there, caught between the order expected of me as a lifeguard and the deeper, quieter call to spiritual reflection. My hands hovered, uncertain, as I tried to decide which role to honor in that moment."}
