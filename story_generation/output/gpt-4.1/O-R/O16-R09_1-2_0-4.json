My last patient before the break, Mrs. Feldman, sat across from me, sniffling and coughing. Her symptoms pointed to a common cold, but I knew I had to be thorough\u2014my duty as a doctor demanded it. I asked more questions, ordered a quick test, and reassured her, all the while thinking about the kosher vendor a few blocks away. It was the only place I could eat while traveling, and it would close soon for the afternoon. If I rushed, I might make it. But if I hurried through Mrs. Feldman\u2019s exam, I risked missing something important, betraying my professional standards. Yet, if I stayed too long, I\u2019d have nothing kosher to eat, violating my religious commitment. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my responsibility to my patient and my obligation to my faith\u2014each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My pen hovered over Mrs. Feldman\u2019s chart, my mind torn between the two worlds I called my own."}
