As a lawyer, I knew I should review every clause, analyze the risks, and ensure my client\u2019s interests were protected, even if the deadline was weeks away. My mind was already mapping out the legal language, but then my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the mosque. Someone had arrived, desperate for guidance, their grief raw and immediate. As the imam, I was expected to offer comfort, to listen, to help them find solace in faith. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the duty to my client, who trusted my diligence, and the responsibility to my community, who needed my compassion. My heart pulled me toward the person in pain, but my professional conscience reminded me of the importance of thorough legal work. I stared at the contract, then at the mosque\u2019s message, torn between the demands of law and the call of faith, uncertain which path to take first."}
