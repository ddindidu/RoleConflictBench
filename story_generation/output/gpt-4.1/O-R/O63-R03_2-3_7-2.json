As a telemarketer, I was expected to stick to my scheduled breaks, never a minute more, with management watching every log. The queue never emptied, and the pressure to keep dialing was constant. But as I glanced at my phone, a message from the convent flashed across the screen: the mayor was pleading for help. The hurricane had left hundreds without shelter, and as a nun, I was expected to lead the relief effort, to be present, compassionate, and selfless. My heart ached for the families huddled in the community center, but my supervisor\u2019s eyes were on the clock, waiting for me to return from my break. I felt torn, the headset heavy on my head, my habit a reminder of my vows. The demands of my job and my calling pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat frozen, caught between duty to my employer and duty to my faith."}
