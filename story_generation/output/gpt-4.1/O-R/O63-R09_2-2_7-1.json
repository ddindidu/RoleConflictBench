The phone queue is relentless, and management has sent two reminders today about sticking to our scheduled breaks\u2014no extra minutes, no exceptions. I know they\u2019re watching the logs, making sure we\u2019re not away from our desks for even a moment longer than allowed. But my mind isn\u2019t on the next call. It\u2019s on the holiday coming up this weekend, and the fact that my kids still don\u2019t know the blessings they\u2019re supposed to recite. I promised myself I\u2019d teach them, that I\u2019d pass on the words my parents taught me, but every evening I come home exhausted, and there\u2019s never enough time. Now, I\u2019m staring at my break schedule, wondering if I can sneak in a call home, maybe recite the blessings over the phone, or if I\u2019ll get flagged for being away too long. The pressure from work and the responsibility to my family and faith are pulling me in opposite directions, and I can feel the anxiety building in my chest as I try to figure out what to do."}
