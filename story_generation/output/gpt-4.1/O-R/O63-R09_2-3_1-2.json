The phone rings, and I launch into my pitch, but the prospect interrupts with a barrage of technical questions. My heart pounds as I fumble for answers, the script suddenly feeling useless. I\u2019m supposed to handle objections smoothly, keep the call on track, but I can\u2019t help thinking about my son at home, struggling with his Torah portion. His bar mitzvah is only weeks away, and I promised to help him practice tonight. My supervisor expects me to stay late to meet my call quota, especially since so many calls are running long with these technical questions. But my son needs me to teach him, to pass on our traditions, to be present. The weight of both roles presses down on me, each demanding more than I feel I can give. I stare at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the voice in my ear and the one waiting for me at home."}
