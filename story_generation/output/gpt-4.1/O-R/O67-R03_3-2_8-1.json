The ambulance\u2019s siren wailed, echoing my own racing heart. The patient in the back was barely clinging to life, and every second counted, but the rain hammered down so hard I could barely see the road. I knew I had to drive safely\u2014one wrong move and we could all end up in a ditch. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes: the family next door had lost everything in a fire. They needed help\u2014food, blankets, comfort. As a nun, I was expected to be there, to serve, to offer solace. But right now, my duty as an ambulance driver demanded my full attention.
