The quarterly filing deadline loomed, and as the company\u2019s accountant, I knew every number had to be perfect. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cAccuracy is everything. No mistakes.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014just fifteen minutes until my daily puja, the sacred time I set aside for prayers and offerings. As a devout Hindu, I never missed my rituals; they grounded me, gave me peace, and connected me to something greater. But the spreadsheets demanded my attention, and the numbers blurred as anxiety crept in. If I paused now, I risked falling behind, maybe even making an error. If I skipped my prayers, I\u2019d feel a deep sense of guilt and spiritual unease. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014precision and reliability at work, devotion and discipline in faith. The minutes ticked by, and I sat frozen, torn between the demands of my profession and the call of my beliefs."}
