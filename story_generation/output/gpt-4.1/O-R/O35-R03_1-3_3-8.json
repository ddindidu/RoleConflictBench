My eyes flicked between the tracks and the clock, counting down the minutes until my shift ended. The intercom crackled, and a passenger\u2019s voice came through, asking for directions to the hospital. I knew I needed to answer clearly, to keep everyone safe and informed. But my mind kept drifting to the convent, to the letter from Mother Superior tucked in my pocket. She\u2019d asked me to lead daily reflections for the retreat\u2014an honor, but also a heavy responsibility. I was expected to guide my sisters in spiritual study, to be present and prepared.
