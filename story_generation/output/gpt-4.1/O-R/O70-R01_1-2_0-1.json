The last package of the day sat on the passenger seat, addressed to a house just a few blocks away. It had arrived at the depot later than expected, and I\u2019d already called the customer to apologize, promising it would be there before evening. My phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. \u201cCan you talk? I really need guidance,\u201d she wrote. I knew her situation was urgent; she\u2019d been struggling with a decision that weighed heavily on her spirit. \n\nAs I pulled up to a red light, I felt the pressure mounting. The delivery company expected punctuality, accuracy\u2014no excuses. But as a pastor, I was supposed to be present, compassionate, available when my flock needed me most. My mind raced, torn between the ticking clock and the silent plea in Sarah\u2019s message. I gripped the steering wheel, feeling the weight of both uniforms I wore, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
