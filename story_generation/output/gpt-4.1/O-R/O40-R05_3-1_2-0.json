The checklist for safety inspections sat on the bench, a reminder of the responsibility I carried as a carpenter. Every screw, every blade, every cord needed my attention before I could let anyone else near them. One missed detail could mean an accident, and I couldn\u2019t let that happen. But as I reached for the drill, my phone buzzed with a calendar alert: \u201cBegin sermon brainstorming\u2014Shabbat in three weeks.\u201d My mind flickered to my congregation, their expectant faces, the comfort they sought in my words. They trusted me to guide them, to offer wisdom and hope. Yet here I was, torn between the tangible safety of my crew and the spiritual nourishment of my community. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full presence, each too important to neglect. My heart pounded as I stared at the tools, then at my notes for the sermon, feeling the impossible pull in both directions."}
