I glanced at the long line of customers, knowing that after the last one, I\u2019d have to start the end-of-day cash deposit. The store manager had reminded us again this week: every deposit must be counted, double-checked, and logged exactly as the corporate policy outlined. No shortcuts, no mistakes. I understood why\u2014money had gone missing before, and the company was strict about compliance.\n\nBut tonight was also Wednesday, and my church\u2019s midweek service started at 6:30. I\u2019d promised myself and my pastor that I\u2019d be there every week, not just for worship but to help with the youth group. My faith teaches me to honor commitments and be present in my community. As I watched the minutes tick by, my stomach twisted. If I rushed the deposit, I could make it to church on time, but I\u2019d be breaking store policy and risking my job. If I did everything by the book, I\u2019d miss the service and let down my church family. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood there, torn, unsure which part of myself to disappoint."}
