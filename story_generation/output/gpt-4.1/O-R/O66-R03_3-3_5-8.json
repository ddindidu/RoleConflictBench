The taxi meter ticked as I navigated the city streets, my mind replaying the Mother Superior\u2019s request: lead daily reflections for the retreat, guide the sisters in spiritual study. I wanted to say yes, to serve, but my shifts behind the wheel paid for the convent\u2019s repairs. \n\nToday, a school zone loomed ahead, children clustered near the curb, their laughter piercing the morning air. Suddenly, orange cones forced all traffic into a single, narrow lane. The car behind me honked impatiently. I slowed, heart pounding, knowing I must obey the law and protect the children, but the delay meant I\u2019d be late for my own prayer time\u2014again. \n\nThe weight of expectation pressed on me: the city demanded vigilance and quick decisions, while the convent called for stillness and contemplation. I felt torn, the demands of the road and the chapel pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which duty should come first."}
