I knew the information was privileged\u2014protected by the very rules that defined my profession. My duty was clear: maintain confidentiality, uphold the trust my client placed in me. Yet, the pressure was immense; a slip could devastate my client\u2019s case, but refusing might escalate tensions and complicate negotiations.\n\nLater that day, as I waited in the courthouse cafeteria, I saw someone cut in line. My upbringing as a Hindu echoed in my mind\u2014dharma, the path of righteousness, demanded I speak up against even small injustices. But my mind was still tangled in the morning\u2019s ethical knots. Was I being true to my values if I let this pass? Or was I simply exhausted from the weight of my professional obligations?\n\nThe expectations from both worlds pressed in on me: the strict codes of my legal role, the moral compass of my faith. I felt torn, uncertain which voice to heed, as I stood there, caught between silence and action."}
