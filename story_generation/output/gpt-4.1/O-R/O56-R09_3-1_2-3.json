I smiled, welcoming them, offering tea and pastries as I always do to help clients relax. Today, though, the pastries were a gift from the bride\u2019s mother\u2014beautiful, delicate, and definitely not kosher. My stomach rumbled; I\u2019d skipped breakfast in the rush to prepare for this big day. I knew my own kosher snacks were in the back, but the expectation was clear: share in the treats, join the celebration, make everyone feel at ease. The bride\u2019s mother pressed a plate into my hands, her eyes warm, expecting me to join in. I could feel the weight of my kippah beneath my hairnet, a reminder of my commitment. My hands trembled slightly as I balanced the plate, torn between the warmth of hospitality and the quiet discipline of my faith. The room was filled with laughter, but inside, I felt the tension coil tighter, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
