As an ambulance driver, I knew how crucial it was to ensure every supply was accounted for\u2014lives could depend on it. But as a devout Hindu, I also felt the weight of my commitment to daily rituals, the chanting and offerings that brought me peace and a sense of connection to something greater. My family and community expected me to never skip a prayer, no matter what. Yet, my colleagues and the patients I might serve expected me to be ready at a moment\u2019s notice, with every piece of equipment in perfect order. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure build inside me. If I stopped now for prayers, I might not finish the check before the next emergency call. If I delayed my prayers, I would break a promise I\u2019d made to myself and my faith. My hands trembled slightly as I stood between the ambulance and my prayer mat, torn by the demands of both worlds."}
