My fingers move quickly, scanning groceries, counting change, trying not to make a mistake. Every beep of the scanner is a reminder that accuracy matters\u2014one wrong total, and the whole line slows down. In the middle of this, my phone buzzes in my pocket. I know who it is: the young couple who asked last week if I could officiate their wedding next year. They want to confirm the date, and I promised I\u2019d get back to them soon. As a rabbi, I know how important this is to them\u2014how much they\u2019re counting on me to be there for their big day. But right now, I can\u2019t step away. The store is packed, and my manager expects me to keep the line moving. My mind races, torn between the duty to my customers and the commitment I feel to my community. I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I\u2019ll have to let down."}
