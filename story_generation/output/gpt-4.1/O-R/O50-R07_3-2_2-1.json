The nurse\u2019s voice still rang in my ears: \u201cThe ventilator\u2019s failing. We need you now.\u201d As a machine repairer, I knew the stakes\u2014every second counted, and a patient\u2019s life hung in the balance. My mind raced through possible fault codes and solutions, but another thought gnawed at me. Tonight was the memorial service at the temple, a ceremony I had promised to help lead. As a Buddhist, my presence was expected; the community looked to me for guidance and calm, especially during rituals honoring the departed. I could already picture the incense curling in the air, the soft chanting, the faces turned toward me in trust. But here, in the harsh light of the ICU, the beeping machine demanded my full attention. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds\u2014one calling for technical precision, the other for spiritual presence. I stood at the threshold, torn between the urgent call of suffering and the quiet pull of compassion, uncertain which path to take."}
