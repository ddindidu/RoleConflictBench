The nurse\u2019s voice still rang in my ears: \u201cThe ventilator\u2019s failing. We need you now.\u201d My mind raced through possible faults, each more urgent than the last. As I reached the door, my phone buzzed\u2014a gentle reminder from the chapel. The daily prayer service was about to begin, and the congregation would be waiting for me to lead them, as I did every afternoon. I pictured the small group, eyes closed, seeking comfort and guidance, expecting my presence and words. But here, a patient\u2019s life hung in the balance, and only my hands could bring the machine back to life. My heart pounded with the weight of both callings. I felt torn, the sacred and the practical pulling me in opposite directions. The expectation to heal, to comfort, to serve\u2014each role demanded all of me, right now. I stood frozen, the ICU door before me, the chapel behind, caught in the impossible space between duty and devotion."}
