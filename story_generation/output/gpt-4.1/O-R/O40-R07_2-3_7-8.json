Her voice trembled with worry\u2014her deck had splintered, and she was afraid someone might get hurt. As a carpenter, I knew I should go right away, assess the damage, and start repairs. People depended on me to keep their homes safe and sound. But my teacher had also asked me to summarize the key teachings of the Lotus Sutra for tomorrow\u2019s gathering. I could hear his gentle reminder: \u201cDiligence in study is as important as meditation.\u201d The expectation was clear\u2014I should devote this evening to reflection and preparation, not to sawing and hammering. My mind spun between the urgent call of my trade and the quiet pull of my spiritual path. I felt the weight of both responsibilities pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each too important to ignore. I sat at my workbench, torn, the scent of sawdust mingling with the memory of incense, unsure which path to follow."}
