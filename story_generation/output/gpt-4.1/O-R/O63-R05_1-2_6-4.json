The call volume was unusually light, and my supervisor had just sent a message: \u201cFeel free to take your break early if you want.\u201d I hesitated, my headset still warm against my ear. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the children\u2019s Torah class at the synagogue would begin in fifteen minutes. As their rabbi, I was expected to be there, ready to teach, to answer their questions, to guide them in Jewish law. \n\nBut my telemarketing job had its own rules. Normally, I\u2019d have to wait for my break, but today, with the relaxed atmosphere, I could leave early\u2014if I wanted. My mind raced. If I took my break now, I could make it to the synagogue on time, fulfilling my duty as a rabbi. But what if the call volume suddenly spiked? Would my absence be noticed? Would I be letting down my team? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my commitment. I sat frozen, torn between the ringing phones and the voices of children waiting to learn."}
