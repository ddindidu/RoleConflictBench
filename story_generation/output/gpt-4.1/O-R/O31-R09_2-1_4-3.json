My radio crackled with updates, and I kept my focus sharp\u2014protecting the scene, making sure no one else got hurt. Hours slipped by, and my stomach growled, reminding me I hadn\u2019t eaten since morning. One of the other officers, trying to help, handed me a sandwich from the station\u2019s stash. I thanked him, but my eyes darted to the label\u2014definitely not kosher. I knew the pantry inside had kosher snacks, but leaving my post, even for a minute, could mean chaos or missed details. My duty as a police officer demanded I stay put, alert and ready. But as a Jew, I felt the weight of my commitment to kosher laws, a promise I made to myself and my faith. The sandwich sat heavy in my hand, and I felt the tension coil inside me, torn between the badge on my chest and the beliefs in my heart."}
