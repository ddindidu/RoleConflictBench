The supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cMove those to the back storage before you leave today.\u201d My arms ached from the day\u2019s labor, but I knew the job wasn\u2019t done until every board and pipe was in its place. Efficiency was expected, and I took pride in not letting the crew down.\n\nBut as the sun dipped lower, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the memorial service at the temple was tonight. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be there, to chant and offer incense with the community. The ceremony was important, a time to honor those who had passed and support the grieving. My absence would be noticed, and I felt the weight of that responsibility.\n\nI looked at the materials, then at the time. My heart pounded with anxiety, torn between the demands of my work and the call of my faith. Both roles asked for my presence, my effort, my respect. I stood there, caught in the middle, unsure which duty to fulfill."}
