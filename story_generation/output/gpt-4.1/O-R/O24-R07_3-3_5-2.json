The defendant\u2019s anxious family waited for my order, knowing he couldn\u2019t be released until I drafted and signed the conditions. My duty as a judge was clear: the law demanded precision, and any delay or error could mean another night in custody for someone who might not deserve it. Yet, as I glanced at my phone, I saw messages from the monastery. The annual festival began at dawn, and I had promised to help with the preparations\u2014an act of devotion and community that, as a Buddhist, I cherished deeply. The monks and laypeople counted on me, not just for my hands but for my presence and spirit. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the solemn responsibility to the law, and the quiet call of my faith. My mind raced, torn between the courthouse\u2019s fluorescent lights and the soft glow of lanterns waiting to be lit at the monastery. I sat at my desk, pen poised, heart divided, uncertain which duty should come first."}
