My client, Mrs. Evans, always expects her antique furniture to gleam, and I know she\u2019ll be disappointed if I don\u2019t manage the supplies properly. I should run to the store before she returns, but as I check the time, my heart sinks. The convent is holding a special healing service for Sister Agnes, who has grown so frail. As a nun, I am expected to be present, to pray and support my sisters, especially in moments like this. The weight of both worlds presses on me\u2014Mrs. Evans\u2019 trust in my work, the community\u2019s need for my prayers. I stand in the hallway, keys in one hand, rosary in the other, torn between the demands of my two lives, feeling the ache of letting someone down no matter which path I choose."}
