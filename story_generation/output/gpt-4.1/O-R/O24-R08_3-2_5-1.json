The defendant\u2019s family waits anxiously for my signature, their hope resting on my words. As a judge, I know the law demands clarity and precision\u2014every condition must be spelled out, every risk weighed. But as I glance at the clock, my heart tightens. It\u2019s Ramadan\u2019s midpoint, and I\u2019m behind on my daily Quran reading. I promised myself I\u2019d catch up tonight, to recite and reflect as my faith expects. The Quran sits unopened in my bag, its verses calling to me, reminding me of the peace I find in their rhythm. Yet the legal order in front of me is urgent, the defendant\u2019s freedom hanging in the balance. My mind tugs in two directions: duty to the law, duty to my faith. I feel the weight of both, the pressure to be thorough and just, the longing to reconnect with my spiritual self. My hand hovers, uncertain, as I wrestle with which responsibility to answer first."}
