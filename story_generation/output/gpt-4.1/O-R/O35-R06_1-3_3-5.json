As the operator, I kept my eyes on the tracks and my ears tuned to the intercom. Suddenly, a passenger\u2019s voice crackled through, asking for directions to a transfer line. I answered calmly, guiding them as best I could, but my mind was elsewhere. Today was the church service I never missed, the one where I was supposed to help set up chairs and greet newcomers. My pastor had reminded me last week how important it was to be present, to show commitment to our faith and community. Yet here I was, behind the controls, responsible for hundreds of lives, unable to leave my post. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my duty to keep passengers safe, and my promise to my church family. I felt torn, guilt rising as I pictured the empty chair where I should be sitting, the hands I wouldn\u2019t shake, the prayers I wouldn\u2019t join. The train rumbled on, and I stared at the tunnel ahead, caught between two worlds, unsure which one I was letting down more."}
