The experiment I\u2019d designed for months was finally ready, and the equipment was available tomorrow\u2014a rare open slot. My colleagues expected me to be there, to run the tests, to gather the data that could push our research forward. But my phone buzzed with a message from the church secretary: \u201cMaria needs to see you. She\u2019s in crisis. She says it can\u2019t wait.\u201d As a pastor, I knew what that meant. Maria\u2019s choices now could shape the rest of her life, and she was reaching out for guidance, for someone to listen and help her find her way. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. The scientist in me wanted to seize the opportunity, to not let the team down. The pastor in me knew that Maria\u2019s pain couldn\u2019t be scheduled. I sat at my desk, torn, the expectations of my two callings pulling me in opposite directions, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which part of myself to honor."}
