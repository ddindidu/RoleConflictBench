My phone buzzed with another email from opposing counsel, their words thinly veiled threats demanding information I knew I could never ethically share. My client\u2019s trust, my oath as a lawyer\u2014these were not negotiable. Yet the pressure was relentless, and I could feel my resolve fraying at the edges.\n\nAt the same time, my thoughts drifted to home. The holiday was approaching fast, and I hadn\u2019t yet found the time to sit with my children and teach them the blessings, the melodies, the stories that my own parents had passed down to me. I could see their expectant faces, hear their questions, feel the tug of tradition and responsibility. I wanted to be the parent who gave them roots, who honored our heritage.\n\nBut the demands of my cases, the late nights, the constant vigilance\u2014these left me drained, torn between my duty to my client and my duty to my family and faith. I stared at the clock, heart pounding, caught between two worlds, unsure which call to answer first."}
