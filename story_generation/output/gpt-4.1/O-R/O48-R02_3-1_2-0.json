In room 204, Mrs. Jensen grimaced, her hands trembling as she tried to lift a spoonful of soup. As a nursing assistant, I knew my duty: help her eat, ease her pain, offer comfort. But my watch buzzed\u2014a gentle reminder that the daily prayer service was about to begin. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead, to be present, to offer spiritual nourishment to those who gathered, even if the service was optional. I could hear the soft shuffle of feet in the chapel down the hall, the quiet anticipation of those waiting for me. My heart pounded with the weight of both callings. Mrs. Jensen\u2019s eyes met mine, pleading for help, while the chapel\u2019s silence seemed to echo its own need. I felt torn, the expectations of care and faith pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my presence, each equally important. I stood frozen, the soup cooling, the prayers waiting, unsure which part of myself to answer first."}
