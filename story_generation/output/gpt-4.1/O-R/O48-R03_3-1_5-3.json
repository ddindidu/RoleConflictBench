His breathing was shallow, and the monitor\u2019s numbers flickered with every fragile heartbeat. As a nursing assistant, I knew I had to check his vitals every few minutes\u2014his condition could change in an instant, and the nurse was counting on my vigilance. But as I glanced at my watch, my heart tightened. The chapel bell began to ring, echoing down the hospital corridor. Morning prayer was starting, and as a nun, I was expected to be present, kneeling with my sisters, offering the day to God. The convent\u2019s order was clear: prayer came first, always. Yet here I was, torn between the sacred silence of the chapel and the urgent beeping of the monitor. I could almost hear Mother Superior\u2019s gentle reminder about obedience, even as I felt the weight of Mr. Alvarez\u2019s life in my hands. My mind raced, caught between two worlds, each demanding my full devotion, each impossible to ignore."}
