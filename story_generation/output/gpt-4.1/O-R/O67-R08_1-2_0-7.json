My uniform feels heavy on my shoulders, a constant reminder that at any moment, I might be called to race through the city, sirens blaring, to save a life. Every second counts; I know that. My team and the people we serve expect me to be ready, alert, and fast. But as I wait, my mind drifts to something else\u2014my dream of performing Hajj. I\u2019ve saved for years, setting aside every spare coin, and this year, my friends are going. They urge me to join them, reminding me of the spiritual importance, the once-in-a-lifetime chance. My family\u2019s eyes shine with hope and pride at the thought. Yet, if I leave now, the station will be short-staffed, and someone else will have to cover my shifts. What if an emergency happens and I\u2019m not there? The weight of both responsibilities presses on me, and I feel torn, caught between the call of duty and the call of faith, unsure which path to follow."}
