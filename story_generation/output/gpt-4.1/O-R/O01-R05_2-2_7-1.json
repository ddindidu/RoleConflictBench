The steel delivery was delayed, and if I didn\u2019t resolve it today, the entire project would fall behind. My mind raced with calculations and contingency plans, but in the back of my mind, another responsibility pressed in. Shabbat was approaching, and I hadn\u2019t yet prepared my sermon. The congregation expected inspiration, guidance, and presence. I glanced at the clock\u2014just a few hours left before sundown. My heart pounded as I weighed the urgency of the construction schedule against the spiritual needs of my community. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, the expectations of architect and rabbi colliding within me."}
