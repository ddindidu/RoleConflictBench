The contractor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need to finish by Friday, or we lose the client.\u201d I glanced at my phone\u2014another message from the electrician, asking if I could stay late to coordinate the next steps. The pressure to deliver flawless cabinetry on time pressed down on me, every joint and hinge a testament to my skill and reliability.\n\nBut as I wiped sweat from my brow, I remembered the children waiting at the synagogue, their eager faces expecting stories of our ancestors, lessons about Shabbat and mitzvot. I was supposed to lead their study session tonight, to pass on the traditions that shaped me. I knew I could reschedule, but I also knew how much they looked forward to our time together, how important it was to nurture their connection to our heritage.\n\nMy heart twisted, caught between the demands of my craft and the responsibility to my community. I stared at the unfinished cabinets, the clock ticking, torn by the weight of both worlds."}
