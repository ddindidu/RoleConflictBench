The store was quiet, and I took pride in making everyone feel welcome, even on slow days. As a cashier, I knew how much a friendly word could brighten someone\u2019s afternoon. Just as I finished ringing up Mrs. Patel\u2019s bread and milk, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Brother Ahmed, a long-time congregant. He sounded desperate, asking if I could meet him soon\u2014he needed guidance about his family, and I was the only one he trusted. My heart tightened. As an imam, I was expected to be available, to listen, to help carry the burdens of my community. But here I was, tied to my register, expected to be present and cheerful for every customer. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. I wanted to be there for Brother Ahmed, but I couldn\u2019t just abandon my post. The competing demands pulled at me, and I felt caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I could meet without letting someone down."}
