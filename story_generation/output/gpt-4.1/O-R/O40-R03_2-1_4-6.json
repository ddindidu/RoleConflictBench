The contractor was waiting for my measurements, and the electrician needed my input before running the wires. The project was already behind schedule, and I could feel the pressure mounting from the team\u2014everyone counting on me to keep things moving. Yet, as the clock struck two, I remembered the quiet afternoon I had promised myself. My Bible and journal sat untouched in my small room, sunlight streaming through the window, inviting me to sit and reflect. The convent was unusually peaceful today, a rare chance for uninterrupted spiritual study. My heart ached for that silence, for the gentle rhythm of prayer and contemplation. But the voices from the workshop called me back, urgent and insistent. I stood in the hallway, torn between the demands of my craft and the longing for spiritual nourishment, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which to answer first."}
