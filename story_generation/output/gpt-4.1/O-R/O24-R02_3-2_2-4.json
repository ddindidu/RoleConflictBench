The emergency motion for a temporary restraining order landed on my desk with a thud, the clerk\u2019s voice urgent: \u201cYou have less than an hour, Your Honor.\u201d I glanced at the thick file, knowing the law demanded my full attention, every detail scrutinized before I could rule. Yet, my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder: Sister Mary was waiting in my office next door, her appointment set weeks ago. She had confided in me after Sunday service, her voice trembling with the need for guidance. As her priest, I was her anchor, expected to listen, to offer solace and wisdom. But as a judge, I was bound to impartiality, to swift and careful justice. My mind raced, torn between the desperate plea in the case file and the silent suffering of a soul seeking comfort. The clock ticked louder, each second a reminder that I could not be in two places at once, and that no matter what I chose, I would be failing someone who needed me."}
