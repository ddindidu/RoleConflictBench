She looked anxious, clutching the bag. \u201cCan you explain how to take this?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling. I began counseling her, carefully explaining the dosage and possible side effects, making sure she understood every detail. My mind was focused, professional\u2014this was my duty as a pharmacist.\n\nLater that afternoon, at the community center, I mingled with familiar faces. Someone asked about hope during hard times, and I instinctively shared a story from my faith, weaving in a gentle lesson. A few people nodded, but I noticed Mrs. Lee in the corner, her expression unreadable. I suddenly remembered her mentioning she wasn\u2019t religious. Was I overstepping as a pastor, imposing beliefs where they weren\u2019t wanted?\n\nThe expectations pressed in: as a pharmacist, I must be objective and inclusive, respecting every background. As a pastor, I\u2019m called to share my faith and offer spiritual guidance. Now, I felt torn\u2014was I helping, or was I crossing a line? The weight of both roles settled on my shoulders, and I wondered how to honor both without betraying either."}
