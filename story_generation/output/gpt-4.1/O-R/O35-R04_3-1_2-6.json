Suddenly, a red alert flashed: brake system malfunction. My heart pounded. Protocol demanded I report it immediately and bring the train to a halt at the next station. Dozens of passengers depended on me for their safety and timely arrival. My hands hovered over the radio, ready to call it in.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket. Earlier, after Fajr prayer, a young man from the mosque had quietly asked if I could spare a moment to talk\u2014he needed guidance, he said, whenever I was free. Now, his message read, \u201cCan you talk now? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d As an imam, I knew the weight of his request; people often reached out in moments of crisis, and my words could mean hope or despair.\n\nI felt torn, the train\u2019s rumble echoing my inner turmoil. The responsibility to protect my passengers pressed against the duty to offer comfort and counsel. Both roles demanded my full attention, but I could not give both at once. My fingers trembled as I weighed which call to answer first."}
