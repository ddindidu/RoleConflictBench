As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: drive carefully, obey every sign, keep my passengers safe. But the clock on the dashboard glowed a warning\u20146:45 p.m. The daily prayer service at the church was at seven, and as the priest, I was expected to lead it, even if it was just the optional evening prayer. My phone buzzed with a reminder, and I felt the weight of my congregation\u2019s quiet expectations. But the roads were chaos\u2014cars weaving, brake lights flaring, puddles hiding potholes. Every instinct told me to slow down, to be cautious, to not risk anyone\u2019s safety. Yet, the thought of the empty altar, the waiting parishioners, and my duty to God pressed on me. I gripped the wheel tighter, heart pounding, torn between the laws of the road and the call of the church, knowing I couldn\u2019t fulfill both perfectly tonight."}
