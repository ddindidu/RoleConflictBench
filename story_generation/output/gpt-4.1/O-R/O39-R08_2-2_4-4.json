My supervisor always emphasized safety\u2014any spill, no matter how minor, had to be cleaned up right away. I reached for the mop and the cleaning solution, but as I bent down, I remembered the office function scheduled for this afternoon. Everyone from the site, including management and office staff\u2014men and women\u2014would be there. I was expected to attend, and as a Muslim, I always made sure to dress modestly, covering my arms and legs properly.\n\nBut now, my work clothes were stained and dirty from the spill. If I cleaned it up, I\u2019d have no time to go home and change into fresh, modest attire before the function. If I left the spill, someone could get hurt, and I\u2019d be failing my responsibility as a laborer. My mind raced, torn between the duty to keep the site safe and the obligation to present myself modestly in front of my colleagues. I stood there, mop in hand, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
