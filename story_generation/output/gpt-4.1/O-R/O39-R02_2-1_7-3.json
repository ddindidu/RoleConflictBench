My foreman\u2019s voice crackles over the radio, reminding us the safety briefing starts in two minutes. I know the rules\u2014if I\u2019m late, the whole crew waits, and I\u2019ll hear about it all day. I tuck my gloves into my belt, ready to join the others, when my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from Mrs. Alvarez, a parishioner. She\u2019s asking if I might have time to talk, not now, but soon\u2014she\u2019s been feeling lost, she says, and could use some guidance.\n\nI stare at the screen, thumb hovering. As a priest, I\u2019m supposed to be available, to offer comfort and counsel, even if it\u2019s just to acknowledge her need. But as a laborer, I can\u2019t be late, can\u2019t let the team down, can\u2019t risk my job. My heart pounds with the weight of both uniforms I wear, the hard hat and the collar, each demanding my presence, each expecting me to put them first. The seconds tick by, and I stand frozen, torn between the call of duty and the call of faith."}
