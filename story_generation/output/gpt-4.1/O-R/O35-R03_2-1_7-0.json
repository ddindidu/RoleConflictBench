The pre-shift briefing was about to begin, and as a subway operator, I knew how crucial it was to stay updated on new operational procedures. Missing it could mean putting passengers at risk or facing disciplinary action. Yet, my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder from Sister Agnes: the monthly food drive at the convent was starting soon. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to serve the community and offer comfort to those in need. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014my duty to the city\u2019s commuters and my calling to serve the hungry. I could picture the faces of the regulars at the shelter, waiting for a warm meal and a kind word. At the same time, I imagined my supervisor\u2019s stern look if I missed the briefing. The weight of both uniforms pressed on my shoulders, and I stood frozen, torn between the tracks and the chapel, unable to move."}
