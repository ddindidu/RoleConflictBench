The supervisor hovered nearby, his voice tight: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford more downtime. Please, find the fault quickly.\u201d My hands moved over the tangled wires, searching for the elusive sensor error that had brought everything to a standstill. Every minute lost meant mounting costs and anxious faces watching me, expecting answers.\n\nMy phone vibrated in my pocket. It was a message from Brother Yusuf, a devoted member of my congregation. \u201cImam, I really need to talk. It\u2019s urgent\u2014my family is falling apart. Can you meet soon?\u201d I could sense the desperation in his words, the kind of pain that needed more than a quick reply. As an imam, I was expected to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and guidance when my community needed me most.\n\nI stared at the blinking lights on the machine, my mind torn. The factory needed me now, but so did Yusuf. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, pulling me in opposite directions."}
