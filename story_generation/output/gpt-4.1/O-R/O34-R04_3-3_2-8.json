My headset crackled with pilots\u2019 anxious voices as the sudden route closure forced dozens of flights into holding patterns. Every second, I calculated altitudes, issued instructions, and tried to keep the airspace from spiraling into chaos. My heart pounded, knowing that one mistake could mean disaster. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the mosque. A community member had arrived, desperate for guidance after a devastating loss. As the imam, I was expected to offer comfort, to listen, to be present in their darkest hour. But here, in the tower, I was the only controller on shift, responsible for hundreds of lives in the air. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the urgent need for spiritual support, the relentless demand for vigilance in the control room. I stared at the radar, torn, my mind racing between the cries for help on the ground and the voices in the sky, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
