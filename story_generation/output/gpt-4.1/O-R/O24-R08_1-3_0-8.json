The hearing was procedural, scheduled in two weeks, but I knew the expectation: every detail must be reviewed, every precedent considered. My colleagues and the law demanded nothing less. Yet, as I opened the file, my phone buzzed with a message from my doctor, confirming what I already feared\u2014my health was declining, and if I wished to perform Hajj, this year might be my last chance. My family\u2019s hopeful faces flashed in my mind, their prayers for me to fulfill this pillar of my faith. The court expected my unwavering attention, but my heart ached for the journey I might never have again. I stared at the file, torn between the duty to my profession and the call of my faith, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
