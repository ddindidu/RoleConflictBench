As an accountant, I was expected to respond quickly, clarify the numbers, and maintain trust. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. In less than ten minutes, I was supposed to meet with Miriam, a conversion candidate, for her final Torah study before her Beit Din. She\u2019d been preparing for months, and this session was crucial. As her rabbi, I was expected to guide her, answer her questions, and offer reassurance before this life-changing moment. My mind raced: if I delayed the client, I risked damaging a professional relationship; if I postponed Miriam, I risked shaking her confidence and commitment. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait. I sat at my desk, torn, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds that needed me\u2014right now."}
