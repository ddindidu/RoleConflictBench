The living room was only half-done, and dust lingered on the shelves. As a housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to leave every corner spotless, but today, I had only managed to tidy up the visible mess and do a quick sweep of the shared spaces. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe expect thoroughness, not shortcuts.\u201d Yet, the temple bell\u2019s distant chime reminded me that the evening chant would begin soon. As a Buddhist, I was expected to join the community in ritual, to be present and mindful, to honor the teachings. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014one toward the unfinished work and the fear of disappointing my employer, the other toward the temple, where my absence would be noticed by the sangha. I stood in the hallway, mop in hand, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, uncertain which path to follow."}
