The city was busy, and I kept my eyes on the road, careful not to rush or take risks. As I pulled up to a red light, I saw Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation, waving frantically from the sidewalk. I rolled down the window, and she hurried over, her face streaked with tears. She told me her son had just left home after a terrible argument, and she didn\u2019t know what to do. As her pastor, I knew she needed me to listen, to offer comfort and guidance, to be present for her in this moment of crisis. But as the ambulance driver, I was expected to keep the vehicle moving, to stick to the schedule, and to ensure the ambulance was where it needed to be for the next emergency. My heart ached as I looked at her, torn between the duty to my job and the call to my faith. The light turned green, and I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me, unsure which to honor first."}
