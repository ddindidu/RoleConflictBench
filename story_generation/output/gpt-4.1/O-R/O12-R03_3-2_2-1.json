My inbox pinged with urgent messages from the engineering team\u2014our main service was buckling under load, and the traces pointed to the functions I\u2019d just merged. My mind raced with possible fixes, the expectation to write clean, efficient code pressing on me like a weight. I knew the team was counting on me to resolve this quickly, to keep our systems running smoothly.\n\nBut then Sister Agnes appeared at the door, her face drawn with concern. \u201cThe family next door lost everything in the fire,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWe\u2019re gathering food and clothes now. They need us.\u201d The call to serve, to be present for those in need, was just as urgent\u2014my vows as a nun demanded compassion and immediate action.\n\nI stared at my screen, heart pounding, torn between the code that needed my attention and the family who needed my hands.
