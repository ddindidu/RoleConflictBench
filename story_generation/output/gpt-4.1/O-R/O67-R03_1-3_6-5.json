My shift was nearly over, and I was supposed to deliver the vehicle to the satellite station for the next crew. The radio crackled with routine updates, but my mind was elsewhere. Tonight, I was meant to lead the prayer vigil at the cathedral\u2014a rare honor, and one my sisters had entrusted to me. The convent expected my presence, my voice guiding the faithful in solemn devotion. Yet here I was, caught in traffic, the ambulance\u2019s red and white paint reflecting in shop windows, the minutes slipping away. I knew the rules: safety first, no rushing, no shortcuts. But the weight of the convent\u2019s expectations pressed on me, the image of the waiting congregation vivid in my mind. My heart pounded with the pressure of both worlds\u2014one demanding calm responsibility, the other spiritual leadership. I stared at the road ahead, torn between duty and devotion, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
