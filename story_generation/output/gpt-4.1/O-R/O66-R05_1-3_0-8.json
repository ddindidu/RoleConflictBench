He mentioned he was heading to a coffee shop, no rush, just meeting a friend. I nodded, trying to focus on the road, but my phone buzzed insistently in the cup holder. A message from the synagogue president flashed on the screen: \u201cRabbi, Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s husband just passed. The family needs you for the funeral as soon as possible.\u201d My heart clenched. As a taxi driver, I owed my passenger a safe, unhurried ride, respecting his time and comfort. But as a rabbi, I was expected to be present for my grieving congregants, to guide them through their sorrow, especially at a moment like this. My mind raced, torn between the duty to the man in my back seat and the sacred responsibility waiting for me elsewhere. I gripped the steering wheel, feeling the weight of both uniforms I wore, unsure which one I could take off, even for a moment."}
