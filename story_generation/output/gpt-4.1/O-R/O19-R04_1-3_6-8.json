A new medication for hypertension had just been approved, and I knew I needed to understand its interactions before it hit our shelves. My phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque: someone was waiting for me, desperate for guidance after a sudden loss. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. As a pharmacist, I owed it to my patients to stay informed, to ensure their safety with every prescription. But as an imam, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and wisdom in moments of crisis. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my profession and the duty to my community. I glanced at the clock, feeling the seconds slip away, and wondered how I could possibly be enough for both."}
