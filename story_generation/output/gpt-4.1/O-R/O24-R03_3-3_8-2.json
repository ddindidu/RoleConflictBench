Suddenly, my clerk slipped me a note\u2014urgent, in bold. The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was explaining. My mind raced. As a judge, I was expected to stay current, to ensure justice was served according to the latest law. I had to halt the proceedings, reconsider everything, and guide the jury with the new ruling. But as I paused, my phone buzzed in my pocket. The mayor\u2019s message flashed: the hurricane had devastated our town, and as a nun, I was needed to lead the relief effort. People were homeless, hungry, desperate for comfort and hope. My sisters were already gathering supplies, waiting for my direction. I felt the weight of two worlds\u2014one demanding my legal expertise, the other my compassion and presence. Both roles needed me, right now, in ways that could not be postponed. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, torn between the law and love, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
