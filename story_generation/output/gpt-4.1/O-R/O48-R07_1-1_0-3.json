As a nursing assistant, my first patient of the day waits for help with bathing and dressing. I see her name on my list and remember her gentle smile, but also her impatience when things run late. I know she expects me soon, and I feel the weight of her reliance on me. Yet, tucked in my pocket is a small slip of paper\u2014a reminder to take ten minutes for mindfulness, a promise I made to myself as a Buddhist. My meditation cushion is set up in the staff break room, and I had planned to sit quietly, breathing in and out, before the rush of the day. But now, the clock ticks closer to my patient\u2019s scheduled time, and I feel the tension rising. My heart pulls me toward the quiet sanctuary of meditation, but my duty tugs me toward the patient\u2019s room. I stand in the hallway, torn between the calm I crave and the care I owe, wrestling with the expectations pressing in from both sides."}
