My son\u2019s bar mitzvah was only a week away, and he still stumbled over the Hebrew, his confidence wavering with every mispronounced word. He needed me\u2014needed my guidance, my patience, my stories about our ancestors and the meaning behind the prayers. I promised him I\u2019d help tonight, that we\u2019d practice until he felt ready. But as I rehearsed the words in my mind, the radio crackled, a reminder that at any moment, a call could come in. My duty as an ambulance driver was clear: respond instantly, save lives, no matter what. Yet, as a Jewish parent, I was expected to pass on our traditions, to be present, especially now. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait for the other. I stared at the radio, heart pounding, torn between the siren\u2019s call and my son\u2019s uncertain voice echoing in my memory."}
