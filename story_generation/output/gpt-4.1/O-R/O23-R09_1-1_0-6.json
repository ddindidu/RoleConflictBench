It was a standard agreement, nothing urgent, and the deadline was weeks away. Still, as a lawyer, I felt the familiar tug of responsibility\u2014review every clause, anticipate every risk, no matter how routine. My phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was the midweek synagogue service. As a Jew, I knew the importance of community and regular attendance, even if my absence wouldn\u2019t be noticed in the crowd. I stared at the contract, then at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. Should I stay and get ahead on my work, fulfilling my duty to my client and my own professional standards? Or should I close the laptop and head to synagogue, honoring my commitment to faith and tradition? The expectations pulled at me from both sides, neither urgent, but both important. My chest tightened as I tried to decide which part of myself to honor tonight."}
