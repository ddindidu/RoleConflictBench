The plant was quiet, production slow, and I knew if I didn\u2019t catch the glitch now, it could halt everything when we ramped up again. My mind was deep in diagnostics when my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent message from the church secretary. Someone from the congregation was waiting in my office, desperate for guidance. Their life was at a crossroads, and they needed me, not just as a friend, but as their pastor. I could picture them, eyes searching for hope, for answers only I was supposed to help them find. But the machine\u2019s intermittent fault nagged at me; if I left now, I might lose the chance to fix it before it failed completely. My hands trembled, torn between the silent plea of the machine and the silent plea of a soul in crisis. Both needed me, both expected me to be present, to solve, to heal. I stood there, heart pounding, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me apart."}
