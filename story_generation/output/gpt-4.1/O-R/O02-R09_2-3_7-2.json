Management is waiting for my estimates\u2014firm numbers, not the vague ranges I\u2019d prefer. The quarterly roadmap depends on me, and I know how much the team relies on my accuracy. But my phone buzzes again: a reminder that my son\u2019s bar mitzvah is just weeks away. He\u2019s struggling with his Torah portion, and I promised I\u2019d help him every evening. Teaching him isn\u2019t just about the words; it\u2019s about passing on our traditions, our history, everything my parents gave me. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I stay late to finish the estimates, I\u2019ll miss another night of practice with him. If I go home early, I\u2019ll let my team down and risk the project\u2019s success. My chest tightens as I try to balance the expectations\u2014engineer, father, Jew\u2014knowing that tonight, I can\u2019t be everything to everyone."}
