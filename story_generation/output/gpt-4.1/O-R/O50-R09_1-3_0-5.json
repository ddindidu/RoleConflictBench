My supervisor expected a quick diagnosis, even though the machine barely ran during these slow weeks. I felt the pressure to prove my worth, to show I could handle even the most stubborn problems. Lunchtime arrived, and the team gathered for a communal meal in the break room\u2014a rare catered spread, meant to boost morale. As I scanned the trays, my heart sank. None of the dishes had kosher certification, and there were no alternatives in sight. My coworkers urged me to join, eager for camaraderie, but I hesitated, torn between my commitment to my faith and the unspoken expectation to be part of the team. The hum of the machine in the background seemed to echo my inner turmoil. I stood there, caught between the demands of my job and the values that shaped my daily life, unsure which expectation I could afford to disappoint."}
