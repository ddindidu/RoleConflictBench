She asked if I could share the files with her to help speed up our workflow. As a lawyer, I know the rules\u2014client confidentiality is sacred, and sharing sensitive information, even internally, is a line I can\u2019t cross. But her request was earnest, and I could sense the pressure to be a team player, to make things easier for everyone.\n\nLater, I glanced at the invitation for the office function this afternoon. It\u2019s a big event, and everyone will be there\u2014men and women, partners and staff. I want to fit in, but as a Muslim, I\u2019m committed to dressing modestly. I worry about standing out, about the silent judgments or awkward questions. My colleagues expect me to be approachable and blend in, but my faith asks me to hold firm to my values.\n\nI feel the weight of both roles pressing in from different sides. The expectations of my profession and my faith seem to pull me in opposite directions, and I can\u2019t help but wonder how I\u2019ll navigate the hours ahead."}
