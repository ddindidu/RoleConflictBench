An emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just landed on my desk, demanding my immediate attention. As a judge, I knew the gravity of the situation\u2014someone\u2019s safety could depend on my swift, careful review. I reached for the case file, my mind already racing through legal precedents and the need for impartiality. Yet, as I glanced at my phone, I saw the reminder: Sunday worship was starting in fifteen minutes. My church community expected me to be there, to worship, to pray, to be present in fellowship. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My heart ached with the desire to honor my faith, to find solace and connection in the sanctuary, but my duty to the law and to those seeking justice demanded my full attention. I stared at the file, torn, the expectations of judge and Christian pulling me in opposite directions, each voice growing louder in my mind."}
