The defendant\u2019s family waits anxiously for my order, knowing that every minute I delay is another minute their loved one spends behind bars. As a judge, I am expected to write a clear, detailed order\u2014no shortcuts, no errors. The law demands precision, and so do the people whose lives hang in the balance.\n\nBut my phone vibrates with a reminder: tonight is my turn to chant the Torah portion at synagogue. The service begins soon, and I know the congregation expects me to be there, to uphold my commitment and honor my faith. My rabbi has already called to say how much it means to the community.\n\nI glance at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I rush the order, I risk making a mistake; if I delay, I let down my community and my faith. My hands hover over the keyboard, my heart pounding as I wrestle with the impossible demands of justice and devotion, knowing I cannot fully satisfy both."}
