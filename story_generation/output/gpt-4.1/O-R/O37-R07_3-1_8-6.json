My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts. Safety first, always.\u201d I knew the rules\u2014every surface, every tool, every moment, I had to be vigilant. As I prepared my cart, my phone buzzed. It was Tenzin, my friend from the temple. \u201cCan we talk about the sermon from yesterday?\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to understand the teaching on mindfulness.\u201d\n\nI felt a tug inside me. As a Buddhist, I wanted to be present for Tenzin, to reflect and share insights, to help him find peace. But the clock was ticking, and I was already behind on my cleaning schedule. If I stopped to talk, I\u2019d have to rush later, maybe skip a step, maybe risk someone\u2019s safety. Yet if I ignored Tenzin, I\u2019d be turning away from the path of compassion and understanding that I valued so deeply. My hands trembled as I stared at my phone, caught between the demands of my job and the call of my spiritual life, unsure which voice to answer first."}
