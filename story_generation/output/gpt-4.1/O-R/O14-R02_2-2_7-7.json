The safety audit was in two hours, and I knew the autoclave\u2019s pressure gauge was still acting up. As the lab\u2019s lead scientist, it was my responsibility to ensure every piece of equipment was in perfect order. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the children\u2019s religious education class I was supposed to lead at the parish in thirty minutes. I could already picture the expectant faces of the children and the trust their parents placed in me as their priest. My mind raced: if I left now, I\u2019d disappoint the parish and possibly let down the children\u2019s spiritual growth. If I stayed, I risked failing the audit and jeopardizing the lab\u2019s safety record. The weight of both callings pressed on me, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which world needed me more at this moment, feeling the pull of duty from both science and faith."}
