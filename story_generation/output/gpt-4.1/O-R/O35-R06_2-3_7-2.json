The supervisor\u2019s voice echoed down the hall, calling us in to review the new safety protocols\u2014attendance was mandatory, and missing it could mean disciplinary action. As I turned to join the others, my phone buzzed. A message from my wife: a close friend from church had just been arrested, accused of something terrible. She was alone at the station, frightened, and needed someone to pray with her, to offer comfort and support. My heart pounded. As a subway operator, I was expected to be present, focused, and professional, especially with new procedures rolling out. But as a Christian, I felt a deep responsibility to be there for someone in crisis, to live out my faith in action, not just words. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each with consequences if I failed. I stood frozen, torn between duty and compassion, the supervisor\u2019s voice growing louder as I stared at my phone, wrestling with what to do next."}
