As a police officer, my training kicked in: secure the scene, protect lives, enforce the law. I sped through the streets, siren wailing, heart pounding with the weight of responsibility. But as I neared the store, my phone buzzed. It was Ahmed, a gentle soul from the mosque, texting, \u201cImam, you said you\u2019d have time to talk today. I really need your advice.\u201d I remembered his troubled eyes after prayer, the way he lingered, hoping for guidance. My duty as an imam was to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and wisdom.
