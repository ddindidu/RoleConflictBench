As a lifeguard, I knew I couldn\u2019t let my attention waver, not even for a second. Today, the pool was crowded, and I spotted a young swimmer flailing near the middle, his strokes growing weaker. My heart pounded, every instinct telling me to stay alert, to be ready to dive in at any moment.\n\nBut my phone buzzed insistently at my side. It was the mayor, again. The hurricane had devastated our town, and as a nun, I was expected to lead the relief effort\u2014organizing food, shelter, and comfort for the hundreds now homeless. The sisters and townspeople were counting on me, and the mayor\u2019s message was clear: they needed me now.\n\nI felt torn, my sense of duty pulling me in two directions. The pool demanded my vigilance, every life in the water my responsibility. Yet, my faith and community called me to serve, to be present for those in desperate need. My hands trembled as I stared at the struggling swimmer and the urgent message, caught between two worlds, unable to move."}
