As a judge, I am expected to write clear and detailed legal opinions, and the new case on my docket demands a standard scheduling order by week\u2019s end. The pressure to be thorough and precise weighs on me; every word I write could shape the course of justice for those involved. Yet, as the evening shadows lengthen, I remember my other role\u2014my identity as a Hindu. My family expects me to join them at the home altar, to light the lamp and offer prayers, a daily ritual that brings peace and continuity to our lives. The incense and chants are meant to center me, but tonight, my mind is restless. I feel the pull of my unfinished legal work, the urgency of deadlines, and the sacred call of my faith. My hands tremble as I reach for the matchbox, torn between the demands of my profession and the expectations of my spiritual life, unsure which duty should come first."}
