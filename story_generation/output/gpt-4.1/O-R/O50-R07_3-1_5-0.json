My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cIf that machine goes down, we lose a whole day\u2019s work.\u201d I wiped my hands on my overalls, glancing at the clock. The temple bell would ring in fifteen minutes, calling everyone to the evening chant. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be there, sitting cross-legged with the others, my mind focused on compassion and peace. The abbot had gently reminded me last week, \u201cYour presence supports the community\u2019s harmony.\u201d But now, the machine demanded my attention, its need urgent and mechanical, while the temple called for my spirit and presence. My heart pounded with the weight of both expectations. I stood between the shrieking metal and the distant, soothing chime of the bell, torn by the impossible choice."}
