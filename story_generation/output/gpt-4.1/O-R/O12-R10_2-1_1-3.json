My team expected me, as a software developer, to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code. The new feature was almost ready, but now performance warnings were popping up. My lead wanted it shipped by tomorrow, but I knew it needed more work. As I mulled over the fixes, I glanced up and saw a coworker quietly cutting in line at the coffee machine. It was a small thing, but as a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma\u2014moral and ethical principles\u2014even in minor situations. Should I say something, or let it go? My mind spun between the pressure to deliver perfect code and the urge to address the small injustice I\u2019d witnessed. Both roles tugged at me, each demanding my attention, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in from all sides."}
