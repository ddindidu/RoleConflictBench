My client\u2019s future depended on my preparation and presence; I could not let them down. Yet, as I reviewed my notes, the chapel bell rang\u2014a reminder of the special healing service for Sister Agnes, who had grown weaker each day. The community expected me, as a nun, to be there, to pray and offer comfort. My heart ached with the weight of both worlds: the solemn duty to my client, who trusted me to fight for justice, and the sacred call to support my sisters in faith. I felt torn, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down. The demands pressed in from both sides, and I closed my eyes, searching for guidance, feeling the tension coil tighter within me as the minutes slipped away."}
