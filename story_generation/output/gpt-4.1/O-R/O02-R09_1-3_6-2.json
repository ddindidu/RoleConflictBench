The project manager wanted my input on the new timeline, and everyone expected me to give a realistic estimate. I knew this planning session was informal\u2014nothing was set in stone yet\u2014but I also knew my numbers would shape the next few weeks for the whole team. My phone vibrated with a reminder: tonight was another study session with my son. His bar mitzvah was only weeks away, and he still stumbled over the Torah portion. My wife and I had promised to guide him, to make sure he understood not just the words, but the meaning behind them. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. My team needed my focus and expertise; my son needed my patience and presence. I stared at the project plan, my mind split between deadlines and ancient verses, feeling the tension rise as I tried to figure out how to be the engineer my colleagues relied on and the Jewish parent my son deserved."}
