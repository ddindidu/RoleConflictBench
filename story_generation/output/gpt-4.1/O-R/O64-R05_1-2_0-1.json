Only a few customers wait, their baskets half-full, their faces patient. My manager expects me to process each transaction quickly and accurately, no mistakes, no delays. But my mind drifts to the sermon I need to finish for Shabbat. The service is only hours away, and I haven\u2019t found the right words to comfort my congregation this week. I feel the weight of their expectations\u2014guidance, wisdom, hope. My hands move automatically, scanning bread and milk, but my thoughts are tangled in scripture and stories. I glance at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I focus on my work here, I\u2019ll have no time to prepare the message my community needs. If I let my mind wander to the sermon, I risk making mistakes at the register. The line grows a little longer, and I feel the tension tighten in my chest, pulled between the demands of the counter and the pulpit, unsure which role to serve in this moment."}
