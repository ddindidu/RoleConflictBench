I rushed over, heart pounding, as the warning lights flashed\u2014if I didn\u2019t act fast, a hazardous leak could endanger the whole lab. My mind raced through the safety protocols I\u2019d drilled into my team, knowing every second mattered. As I reached for the emergency shutoff, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mrs. Carter, whose husband had passed last month. She was having a hard day, and I\u2019d promised to check in, to be there as her pastor, her support. I stared at the phone, guilt gnawing at me. The lab needed me\u2014lives could be at risk. But so did Mrs. Carter, who might be alone in her grief, waiting for a word of comfort.
