The golden tone she\u2019d requested looked a shade too brassy under the salon lights, and I saw her lips press into a thin line as she stared at her reflection. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d I asked, forcing a smile, but my mind was already racing. It was almost sunset, and I hadn\u2019t yet lit the lamp at my home altar or offered my evening prayers\u2014something I\u2019d promised myself never to skip, no matter how busy work became. \n\nShe hesitated, then quietly admitted she\u2019d hoped for something softer, less bold. My heart sank. As a hairdresser, I knew I needed to listen, reassure her, maybe even redo the colour if she wished. But the minutes were slipping away, and the thought of missing my daily ritual gnawed at me. My family\u2019s expectations, my own faith, the peace I found in those few moments of prayer\u2014all tugged at me from one side, while my professional pride and duty to my client pulled from the other. I stood there, caught between the mirror and the memory of the lamp waiting to be lit, unsure which role to answer first."}
