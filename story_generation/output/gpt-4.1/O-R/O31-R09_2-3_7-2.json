As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, to listen to both sides and make a decision based on the facts. But my mind kept drifting to my son, sitting at home with his Torah portion open, struggling to master the words for his upcoming bar mitzvah. As a Jewish parent, I was supposed to guide him, to teach him the traditions and values that had shaped my own life. The drivers\u2019 voices grew louder, each insisting the other was at fault, and I felt the weight of my badge pressing against my chest. I glanced at my watch, knowing I was already late to help my son practice. The demands of my duty pulled me in one direction, while the expectations of my faith and family tugged me in another. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once, and I stood there, torn, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
