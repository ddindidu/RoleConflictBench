The contested motion is scheduled for tomorrow morning, and my client\u2019s case hangs in the balance. I pore over legal briefs, searching for the right argument, knowing that my client expects me to be sharp, prepared, and unwavering in court. My phone buzzes\u2014a gentle reminder from the temple. Tonight is the routine evening chant, a ceremony I promised to attend. The sangha expects my presence, my voice joining theirs in calm unity, my mind free from worldly attachments.\n\nBut my mind is anything but free. I feel the weight of my client\u2019s trust, the pressure to perform, to win. At the same time, I yearn for the peace of the temple, the comfort of ritual, the teachings that remind me to let go of ego and desire. The two worlds pull at me, each demanding my full attention, each with its own claim on my time and spirit. I sit at my desk, torn, the courthouse and the temple both waiting for me."}
