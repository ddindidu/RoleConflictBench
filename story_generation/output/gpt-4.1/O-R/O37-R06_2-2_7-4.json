I know she\u2019s right\u2014one mistake could put patients at risk. Lately, I\u2019ve noticed some of my coworkers skipping steps, but I can\u2019t bring myself to do the same. I double-check my equipment, wash my hands until they\u2019re raw, and stay late to make sure everything\u2019s spotless. \n\nBut today is Sunday, and my church expects me there. Pastor always says, \u201cWorship is not just for you, but for the whole community.\u201d I love the singing, the prayers, the sense of belonging. Missing a service feels like letting my faith and friends down. Yet, with the extra cleaning shifts and the need to follow every protocol, I\u2019m exhausted and running late. My heart aches as I look at the clock, torn between my duty to keep the hospital safe and my commitment to worship with my church family. I stand in the supply closet, gloves in hand, wrestling with what to do next."}
