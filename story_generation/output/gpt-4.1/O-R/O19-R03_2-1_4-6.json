My heart longed for the stillness, the gentle turning of pages, the silent conversation with God. Just as I settled in, my phone buzzed\u2014an urgent call from the pharmacy. A patient, newly prescribed a complex medication, was waiting for counseling. The staff needed me to explain the regimen and possible side effects, to offer reassurance and clarity. I could picture the patient\u2019s anxious face, the trust placed in my knowledge. Yet, the convent\u2019s expectation was clear: this was my time for reflection, to nurture my soul and fulfill my spiritual duties. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding my presence for healing of the body, the other for healing of the spirit. I sat frozen, torn between the needs of my patient and the needs of my own faith, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing minute."}
