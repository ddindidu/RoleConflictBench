It\u2019s Ramadan\u2019s midpoint, and my mind is heavy with the knowledge that I\u2019m behind on my daily Quran reading. I promised myself I\u2019d catch up during my break, but the minutes keep slipping away. Suddenly, I spot a child in the deep end, flailing where swimming is strictly forbidden. My training kicks in\u2014enforce the rules, keep everyone safe. But my heart aches with the weight of my faith, the expectation to pause, recite, and reflect, especially now, when every moment of Ramadan feels precious and fleeting. I grip the Quran in my bag, feeling the pull of my spiritual duty, while my eyes stay locked on the struggling child. The demands of both roles press in on me, each urgent in its own way, and I feel myself caught in the impossible space between them, unsure which call to answer first."}
