I closed the notebook, the half-formed sermon ideas swirling in my mind, and stood to greet her. As a hairdresser, I knew how important it was to make her feel welcome, to ease her nerves with a warm smile and gentle conversation. But as I led her to the chair, my thoughts kept drifting back to the blank page waiting for inspiration\u2014Shabbat was approaching, and the congregation would expect a message that was thoughtful, relevant, and uplifting. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: the immediate need to be present for my client, to listen and reassure, and the looming responsibility to my community, to find words that would guide and comfort them. My heart raced as I tried to focus on her, but the sermon topics tugged at my mind, each demand pulling me in a different direction."}
