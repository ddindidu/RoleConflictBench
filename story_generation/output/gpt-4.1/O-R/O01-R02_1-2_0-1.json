As an architect, I was trained to spot even the smallest inconsistency, and today I found a few in the new community center\u2019s plans. They were minor\u2014nothing that would cause immediate danger, but enough to nag at my conscience. I knew the right thing was to stay late, double-check every detail, and ensure the building would be safe and compliant. But as a priest, I was also expected to lead the main weekly service tonight, the one that brought together nearly everyone in our community. They relied on me for guidance, for comfort, for the rituals that gave their lives meaning. My phone buzzed with reminders from both worlds: the contractor asking for my final approval, and a parishioner confirming the service time. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the safety of a building and the spiritual needs of my people, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
