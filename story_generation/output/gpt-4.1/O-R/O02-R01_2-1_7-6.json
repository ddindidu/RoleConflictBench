Management needed my estimates for the new product launch, and they were counting on me to be precise. I knew the team\u2019s workload, the technical risks, the pressure to deliver on time. My mind raced through calculations, weighing every variable, knowing that a single misjudgment could derail the entire quarter.\n\nBut my thoughts kept drifting back to the community gathering last night. As a pastor, I\u2019d shared a story from scripture, hoping to inspire. Instead, a few attendees had approached me afterward, questioning whether it was appropriate to bring faith into a casual setting. Now, I felt the weight of their expectations too\u2014teach with conviction, but respect boundaries, never overstep.\n\nThe meeting invite flashed again. I felt torn, my mind split between the demand for technical certainty and the call to spiritual sensitivity. Both roles asked for my best, but in such different ways. I stared at the screen, heart pounding, unsure which expectation I could meet without failing the other."}
