The production system was down\u2014users locked out, support tickets piling up, and the outage traced directly to a bug in my code. My team needed me to troubleshoot, to fix what I\u2019d broken, and every minute lost meant more frustrated customers and mounting pressure from my manager.\n\nBut as I reached for my laptop, I saw her waiting in the next room\u2014eyes red, hands trembling. She\u2019d called me late last night, desperate for guidance, her life at a crossroads. She needed me to listen, to help her find hope and clarity in the middle of her crisis. I could see the expectation in her face: to be present, to offer wisdom, to be her pastor.\n\nMy mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the sacred trust of my calling. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each insisting I couldn\u2019t let them down. My heart pounded as I stood in the doorway, caught between two lives, knowing I could only choose one\u2014at least for now."}
