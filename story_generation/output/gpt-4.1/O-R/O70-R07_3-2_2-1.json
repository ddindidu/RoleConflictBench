The hospital\u2019s address blinked on my delivery app, a reminder that the medical supplies in my trunk were urgently needed. I could almost feel the weight of the patients\u2019 hopes, the nurses\u2019 anxious glances at the clock, all depending on me to arrive on time. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo delays, especially not for the hospital runs.\u201d\n\nBut tonight was also the memorial service at the temple. The community would gather, incense curling in the air, chanting for those who had passed. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be there, to help set up, to join in the prayers, to show compassion and presence. My teacher had asked me personally, \u201cWill you help us tonight?\u201d I could picture the faces of the elders, the gentle nods of gratitude.\n\nCaught between the urgency of my delivery and the pull of my spiritual community, my chest tightened. I wanted to be reliable in both worlds, but the roads ahead seemed to split, each demanding all of me. I sat in my car, the engine idling, torn and uncertain."}
