As a police officer, I knew how important it was to stay fit\u2014my job demanded it. Protecting citizens and property wasn\u2019t just about quick thinking; it was about being physically prepared for anything. Just as I grabbed my keys, my phone buzzed. It was Tenzin, my friend from the temple. He sounded troubled, asking if I had time to discuss the sermon we\u2019d heard last weekend. He valued my perspective, and as a Buddhist, I felt a responsibility to support him, to engage in spiritual study and reflection together. I glanced at the clock. If I stayed to talk, I\u2019d miss my workout, but if I left, I\u2019d be turning away from someone seeking guidance. The weight of both uniforms\u2014my badge and my mala beads\u2014pressed on me. I stood in the hallway, torn, feeling the tension between my duty to protect and my commitment to compassion, unsure which path to take."}
