Tomorrow, I was scheduled to appear in court for a procedural hearing\u2014a minor matter, one that could be postponed with a simple request. Yet, as a lawyer, I knew my client expected me to be there, to represent them with unwavering commitment, no matter how trivial the case seemed. At the same time, my superior at the convent had chosen me to lead the prayer vigil at the city\u2019s cathedral, a rare honor and a public testament to my devotion as a nun. The vigil was scheduled for the exact hour of the hearing. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me: the legal profession\u2019s demand for reliability and the convent\u2019s expectation of spiritual leadership. My mind raced with possible excuses, but each felt like a betrayal\u2014either to my client\u2019s trust or to my sisters\u2019 faith in me. I sat in silence, torn between the courtroom and the altar, knowing that whatever I chose, a part of me would be left behind."}
