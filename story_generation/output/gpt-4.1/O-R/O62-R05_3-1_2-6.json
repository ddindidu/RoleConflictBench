The beach was packed, high tide swelling the waves, and I felt the familiar tension coil in my chest\u2014one slip, one missed sign, and someone could be in real danger. My whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder of my duty to these swimmers. Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I hesitated, but the call was from Miriam, a young woman from my congregation. She and her fianc\u00e9 wanted to know if I could officiate their wedding next summer. As their rabbi, I knew how much this meant to them; my presence would bless their union, and my answer would shape their plans. But every second I spent on the phone was a second I wasn\u2019t watching the water. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014protector of lives, shepherd of souls.
