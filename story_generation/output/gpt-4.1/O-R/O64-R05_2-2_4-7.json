Store policy was clear: no returns without proof of purchase. She pleaded, explaining it was a gift for her son\u2019s bar mitzvah\u2014today, in fact. My heart twisted. I knew how important this day was; as a rabbi, I was supposed to be at the synagogue soon, leading a young boy through his rite of passage. The clock on the wall ticked closer to the ceremony\u2019s start. My manager expected strict adherence to policy, but my other community expected me to be present, compassionate, and understanding. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the store apron and the rabbinic tallit\u2014pressing on my shoulders. The woman\u2019s eyes searched mine for empathy, while my phone buzzed with reminders from the synagogue. I hesitated, torn between the rules of my job and the values of my calling, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
