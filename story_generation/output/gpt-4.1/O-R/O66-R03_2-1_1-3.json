My passenger, a young woman with anxious eyes, slid into the back seat, clutching her train ticket. \u201cPlease, I can\u2019t miss this train,\u201d she pleaded, glancing at her watch. I nodded, feeling the weight of her urgency. The train station was clear across town, and traffic was already thickening. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder: morning prayers in the chapel were about to begin. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to join my sisters in devotion and reflection, to uphold the discipline that shaped our lives. But as a taxi driver, I was responsible for this woman\u2019s safe and timely arrival, her hope resting in my hands. My heart pounded as I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the sacred call of prayer and the immediate need before me. The city\u2019s noise faded, replaced by the clamor of my own conscience, as I sat at the crossroads of duty and faith, uncertain which path to follow."}
