An aircraft was approaching the boundary, and protocol demanded I coordinate its handover smoothly. My colleague glanced at me, expecting my usual calm efficiency. At the same time, my phone vibrated\u2014a reminder that I was to lead the afternoon prayer at the mosque in ten minutes. The congregation would be small today, and another worshipper, fully capable, was present to lead if I couldn\u2019t make it. Still, I knew some in the community valued my presence, expecting me to guide them in worship as I always did. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility of ensuring safe skies and the spiritual duty I cherished. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each expecting my full attention, and I felt the weight of their trust. I stared at the radar, heart pounding, caught between the call of duty and the call to prayer, uncertain which path to take."}
