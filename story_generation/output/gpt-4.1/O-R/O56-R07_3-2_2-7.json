I put on my warmest smile, ushering them in, offering tea, and assuring them everything would run smoothly. Inside, though, my mind was elsewhere. Tonight was the weekly Buddhist study circle, and we were finally discussing a chapter I\u2019d been eager to explore\u2014one that promised insight into letting go of attachment and embracing presence. I\u2019d promised myself and my teacher I\u2019d be there, fully engaged, not just physically but in spirit. Yet here I was, scissors in hand, listening to the bride\u2019s nervous chatter, feeling the weight of her expectations to calm her and make her day perfect. My phone buzzed with a gentle reminder about the study circle. I felt torn, the gentle pull of my spiritual path at odds with the immediate, pressing needs of my clients. My heart raced as I tried to be present for the bride, while a part of me longed for the quiet, reflective space of the sangha."}
