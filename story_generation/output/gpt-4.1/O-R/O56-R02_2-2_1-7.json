Her eyes darted around, searching for reassurance. As a hairdresser, I knew my job: greet her warmly, offer her tea, make her feel at ease in this unfamiliar place. I smiled, ready to welcome her, but my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the children\u2019s religious education class at the parish was about to begin. As their priest, I was expected to be there, to guide them, to answer their questions about faith and life. My heart thudded with the weight of both roles. The woman\u2019s anxious glance met mine, silently pleading for comfort, while in my mind I pictured the children gathering in the church hall, waiting for me to lead them. I stood frozen, torn between the gentle art of hospitality and the sacred duty of teaching, feeling the pressure of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
