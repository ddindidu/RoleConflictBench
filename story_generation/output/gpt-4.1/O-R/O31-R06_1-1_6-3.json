The driver, an elderly woman, had just rushed inside, late for Sunday worship. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, enforcing the law equally. The rules were clear\u2014no exceptions. But as a Christian, I understood the importance of Sunday worship, the sense of community, and the grace we\u2019re called to show one another. I thought about how I often missed services myself, torn between duty and faith, and how much it meant to be present, even if only for a short while. My badge weighed heavy on my chest, a reminder of my responsibility, while my heart tugged in another direction, urging compassion. The expectations of my uniform and my faith pressed in on me, each demanding something different. I hesitated, caught between the law I swore to uphold and the mercy I believed in, unsure which path to choose."}
