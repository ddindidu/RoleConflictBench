As a repairer, I was expected to be patient, thorough, and reassuring\u2014never letting frustration show, always ready to guide. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. In fifteen minutes, I was to meet Anna from the parish, who had confided in me about her doubts, her voice trembling with fear and hope. My role as a nun demanded presence, deep listening, and spiritual wisdom\u2014qualities that required my full attention and a quiet mind. The two calls for help pulled at me from opposite directions. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, my mind racing with technical instructions and words of comfort, torn between the hum of machines and the silence of prayer."}
