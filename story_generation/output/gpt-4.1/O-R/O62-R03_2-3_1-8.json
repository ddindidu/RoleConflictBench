The sun was relentless, but my focus couldn\u2019t waver\u2014not with so many lives depending on my vigilance. Suddenly, I noticed a swimmer floundering near the middle, their strokes growing frantic. My muscles tensed, ready to leap in if needed. But as I watched, my mind drifted to the chapel, where the Mother Superior had just asked me to lead daily reflections for the retreat. She expected me to prepare thoughtful meditations, to guide the sisters in spiritual growth. The weight of her request pressed on me; I was supposed to be in quiet study, immersed in scripture, not perched here, heart pounding, watching for danger. I felt torn, pulled between the urgent, physical responsibility of saving lives and the sacred duty of nurturing souls. My hands gripped the chair, my mind racing\u2014how could I possibly be both protector and spiritual guide at the same time?"}
