She asked about her blood pressure, her cholesterol, and what she could do to stay healthy. I listened carefully, answering her questions with the clarity and empathy I knew she needed. As I finished, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the church secretary. Mark, a longtime member, was waiting in the chapel, desperate for guidance about a painful decision he faced. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. Mrs. Lee looked at me, expecting reassurance and medical advice, while Mark waited for spiritual wisdom and comfort. I could feel my heart tugged in two directions, each role demanding my full presence, each person needing something only I could give. I glanced at the clock, torn between the duty to my patient and the call to my congregation, unsure how to be both healer and shepherd in the same moment."}
