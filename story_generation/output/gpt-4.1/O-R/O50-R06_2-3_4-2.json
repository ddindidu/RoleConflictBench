I knew they\u2019d missed their last service window, and it was my job to get them cleaned and maintained before something failed. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any downtime. Just do what you have to do.\u201d But as I opened the panel of the first machine, I noticed a shortcut\u2014one I\u2019d seen others take before. It would get the machines running cooler, at least for now, but it meant bypassing a safety protocol and logging a false maintenance report. \n\nAs a Christian, I\u2019d always tried to live honestly, to do what was right even when no one was watching. The thought of lying on the report twisted my stomach. But the pressure was real\u2014if I didn\u2019t get these machines back online fast, production would halt, and I\u2019d be letting everyone down. My hands trembled as I weighed the expectations: the company needed results, but my faith demanded integrity. I stared at the maintenance log, heart pounding, caught between the demands of my job and the values I held most dear."}
