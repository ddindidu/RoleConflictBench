New drugs, new protocols\u2014so much to keep up with if I wanted to be the best pharmacist I could. My mind raced with the pressure to stay ahead, to not let my patients down. Just then, a message popped up from Sarah, a friend from church. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and her words were heavy with pain. I knew, as a Christian, I should reach out, offer comfort, maybe even call her right now. But my break was almost over, and I hadn\u2019t finished reading about the new medication updates. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to my profession, to be knowledgeable and prepared, and the call to show love and kindness, to be present for someone in need. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which voice to listen to first."}
