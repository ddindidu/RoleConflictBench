The maintenance checklist was due soon, and as the lead scientist, it was my job to ensure every piece of equipment was in perfect order. No malfunctions had been reported, but protocol demanded a thorough check. I glanced at the clock\u2014just past sunset. The lab was quiet, and for once, my evening was free from meetings or urgent emails. I had been looking forward to this rare chance to recite and reflect on the Quran, something my heart had been yearning for after a long week. Yet, the thought of the checklist nagged at me. If I started now, I could finish the maintenance before tomorrow, but it would mean postponing my spiritual time. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the scientist in me urging diligence and responsibility, the Muslim in me longing for peace and connection with Allah. I closed my eyes, feeling the tension build, torn between duty and devotion, unsure which path to take."}
