The space needed to be functional, nothing extravagant\u2014just enough to serve my needs. As an architect, I felt the familiar satisfaction of shaping a room to fit its purpose, every angle and measurement a small act of order in a chaotic world. But the bell tolled from the chapel, its sound echoing through the halls, a reminder of my other life. As a nun, I was expected to attend daily prayers, to be present in body and spirit. Today, the Mother Superior had asked me to lead a prayer vigil at the city\u2019s cathedral, representing our convent before hundreds. The weight of that responsibility pressed on me, even as my mind raced with ideas for the studio. I felt torn\u2014my hands itching to finish the sketches, my heart pulled toward the sacred duty awaiting me. The expectations of both worlds collided within me, each demanding my full devotion, and I sat frozen, unable to move forward in either direction."}
