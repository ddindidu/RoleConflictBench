The construction cones forced all traffic into a single, narrow lane, and the car behind me honked impatiently. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to obey the speed limit and drive defensively, especially here. But my phone buzzed on the dashboard\u2014a message from Farid, a community member. \u201cImam, if you have a moment today, I could really use your advice,\u201d he\u2019d written earlier. I remembered the heaviness in his voice at Friday prayers. My mind raced: if I stopped to call him now, I\u2019d be neglecting my duty to drive safely. If I waited, I might miss the chance to help someone in spiritual need. The pressure from the impatient driver behind me grew, and so did the weight of Farid\u2019s unspoken troubles. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the demands of the road and the call to guide my community, feeling pulled in two directions at once."}
