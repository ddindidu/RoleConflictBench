As a judge, I was expected to be thorough, to review every new legal development before the next session. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. Friday prayers were only hours away, and I was the sole imam scheduled to deliver the Khutbah. The community had already announced my topic, and I knew how much they looked forward to the sermon, especially in these uncertain times. My phone buzzed with reminders from both the court and the mosque. I felt the weight of two worlds pressing on my shoulders\u2014one demanding my legal expertise, the other my spiritual guidance. I opened the appellate decision, but my mind drifted to the congregation waiting for words of hope. I tried to focus, but the expectations of both roles pulled me in opposite directions, leaving me torn and restless, uncertain which duty to serve first."}
