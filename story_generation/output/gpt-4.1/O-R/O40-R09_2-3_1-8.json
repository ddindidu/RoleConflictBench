It was David from the synagogue\u2014there was a funeral prayer in half an hour, and they were one person short for the minyan. My heart clenched. I glanced around the workshop: tools scattered, wood scraps underfoot, cords snaking across the floor. I knew the safety protocols by heart\u2014never leave a messy site, always secure the area before stepping away. If I left now, someone could trip, or worse, get hurt. But the call from David echoed in my mind. As a Jew, I was expected to help form the minyan, especially for a funeral prayer. It was a mitzvah, a sacred duty. My hands trembled as I weighed the risks: the responsibility to my coworkers\u2019 safety, the obligation to my faith and community. I stared at the broom, torn between two worlds, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me, demanding an answer."}
