A signal delay flashed on my panel\u2014just a few minutes, but enough to throw off the schedule. I adjusted the speed, careful not to jolt the passengers, knowing every second mattered. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a message from the mosque committee: the congregation was gathering early for the special remembrance, and I was the only one authorized to lead the prayer. My heart pounded. I pictured the rows of worshippers waiting, their trust in me to guide them in devotion. Yet here I was, responsible for hundreds of commuters, each expecting a safe, timely journey. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding precision and calm, the other spiritual leadership and presence. I felt torn, caught between the rhythm of the rails and the call to prayer, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
