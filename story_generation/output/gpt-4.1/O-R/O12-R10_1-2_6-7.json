The UI glitch wasn\u2019t critical\u2014users could refresh and move on\u2014but QA had flagged it again, and my manager wanted it fixed before the weekend. I glanced at the clock. My family was already preparing for the puja, the scent of incense drifting from the living room. Today was special\u2014my cousin\u2019s thread ceremony, a milestone in our tradition. My mother had laid out my kurta, reminding me to be ready in half an hour. \n\nBut my inbox kept pinging, and the pressure from work was mounting. I knew my team was counting on me to resolve this, to keep our release on track. At the same time, my family expected me to be present, to honor our rituals and show respect. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my team and the responsibility to my family and faith. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, and I sat frozen, unable to choose which expectation to let down."}
