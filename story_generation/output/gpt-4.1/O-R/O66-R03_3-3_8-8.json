My phone buzzed with another message from the passenger: \u201cAre you close? Please hurry, I\u2019m late!\u201d I gripped the steering wheel, feeling the pressure to deliver the kind of prompt, courteous service expected of a taxi driver. But my mind kept drifting to the convent, to the quiet chapel where the Mother Superior had just asked me to lead daily reflections for the retreat. She\u2019d looked at me with such trust, expecting me to be present, prepared, and spiritually focused. Yet here I was, weaving through traffic, my habit tucked under my jacket, my heart torn. The passenger\u2019s impatience pressed on one side, the weight of my spiritual duty on the other. I could almost hear the sisters gathering, waiting for guidance, while my phone vibrated again with the passenger\u2019s urgency. My hands trembled as I wondered which expectation I would fail tonight."}
