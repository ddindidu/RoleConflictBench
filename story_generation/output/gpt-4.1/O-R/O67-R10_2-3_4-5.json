As an ambulance driver, I knew every second mattered. I rehearsed the steps in my head\u2014immobilize, manage pain, reassure her. But as I turned a corner, I saw something that made my heart pound for a different reason. A group of men in uniforms, supposed to be helping, were taking money from a frightened street vendor. I recognized the corruption instantly. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act against injustice, no matter the cost. My hands tightened on the steering wheel. The woman needed me, but so did the man being wronged. My duty as a driver was clear\u2014get to the patient, provide care. But my conscience screamed at me to intervene, to not turn a blind eye. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something I could not give to both at once. I slowed, torn between the flashing lights behind me and the silent call of my beliefs."}
