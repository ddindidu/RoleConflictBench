Mrs. Chan sits across from me, her pill bottles lined up like sentinels. She\u2019s just been prescribed a new anticoagulant, and I know the risks\u2014bleeding, interactions, confusion. My duty as a pharmacist is clear: I must walk her through every detail, answer her questions, ensure she leaves with understanding and safety. But as I begin, my phone vibrates with a gentle reminder: the Buddhist study circle meets in thirty minutes. Tonight\u2019s chapter is one I haven\u2019t read, and I promised myself I\u2019d be present, engaged, not just physically but spiritually. My teacher expects thoughtful participation, and I long for the peace and insight those evenings bring. Yet here I am, torn between the urgent needs of my patient and the quiet call of my practice. My mind races, guilt and responsibility tugging in opposite directions. I want to be fully present for both, but time and energy are finite. I look at Mrs. Chan, then at the clock, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me, unsure which path to follow."}
