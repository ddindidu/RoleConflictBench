I glanced at the clock\u2014thirty minutes until I was supposed to stand before a room of eager young faces, ready to teach them the week\u2019s parsha. My hands gripped the steering wheel as I navigated the ambulance through the congested streets, siren wailing, but my mind was split. As a driver, I was expected to get my patient to the hospital quickly, but above all, safely. Yet as a rabbi, I was expected to be present, to guide and inspire, to never let my students down. I could feel the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders, the paramedic\u2019s jacket and the rabbi\u2019s tallit. Each role demanded my full attention, but I could not be in two places at once. My heart pounded with the impossible choice, torn between the duty to save and the duty to teach, as the city\u2019s chaos pressed in around me."}
