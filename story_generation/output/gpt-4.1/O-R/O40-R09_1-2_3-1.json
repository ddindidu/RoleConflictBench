The client wanted it ready in two weeks, and I needed to estimate the wood, hardware, and finish\u2014then place the order before the supplier\u2019s weekly cutoff. My mind raced through measurements and costs, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the holiday was just days away. My children still hadn\u2019t learned the blessings for the festival, and I\u2019d promised my wife I\u2019d help teach them tonight. I could picture their eager faces, waiting for me to share the stories and songs my father once taught me. But the numbers on the page pulled at me, the pressure of deadlines and the fear of disappointing a customer. I felt torn, the weight of my craft in one hand and the responsibility of passing on our traditions in the other. My heart ached as I tried to decide which role needed me more in this moment."}
