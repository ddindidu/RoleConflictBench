My job as a machine repairer was clear: I was supposed to guide clients, help them use the machines properly, and prevent costly mistakes. But this operator, despite my repeated instructions, kept ignoring the guidelines, and the material waste was piling up. My supervisor expected me to be firm, maybe even write a formal complaint. Yet, as a Christian, I tried to live by patience, kindness, and forgiveness. I knew the operator was new and probably anxious, and I felt a tug to show understanding rather than frustration. The pressure from management to stop the waste clashed with my desire to treat the operator with grace. My mind spun with questions\u2014should I confront him more harshly, or keep offering gentle advice? The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I felt the weight of the decision I had to make."}
