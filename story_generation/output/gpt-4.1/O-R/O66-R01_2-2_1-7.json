My train leaves soon,\u201d he pleaded. As a taxi driver, I felt the pressure to deliver him safely and on time, weaving through the city\u2019s late afternoon traffic. But as a pastor, my mind replayed the sermon I was preparing for Sunday\u2014about patience, honesty, and resisting the urge to cut corners for personal gain. The temptation to speed, to run a yellow light, gnawed at me. I imagined my congregation\u2019s faces, trusting me to model the very values I preached. Yet, the man in my backseat depended on me for his own urgent need. My hands tightened on the wheel, heart pounding, as I wrestled with the expectations of both roles\u2014one demanding swift action, the other urging me to uphold the principles I taught. The city lights blurred as I faced the impossible choice, torn between duty to my passenger and duty to my faith."}
