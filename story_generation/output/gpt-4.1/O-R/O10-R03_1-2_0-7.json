The quarterly filing deadline loomed, and as the accountant for the convent, I knew every figure had to be precise. The sisters and the board trusted me to keep our finances in order, and any mistake could mean trouble for our small community. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but my mind wandered to the note slipped under my office door that morning. Sister Agnes had written that Maria, a parishioner, was waiting in the chapel, desperate to talk about her crisis of faith. As a nun, I was expected to offer guidance and comfort, to be present for those in spiritual need. Yet, the numbers on the screen demanded my focus, and the clock ticked steadily toward the filing deadline. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing on my chest. Should I close the ledger and go to Maria, or finish the reports first? The expectations of accuracy and compassion pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat frozen, heart pounding, unable to choose."}
