Tomorrow, I must guide a team of apprentices, and every measurement, every joint, must be perfect. I run my fingers over the grain of the wood, imagining the finished frames, but my mind is restless. Mother Superior\u2019s voice echoes in my memory\u2014she entrusted me to lead the prayer vigil at the city square tomorrow, a rare honor for our convent. The sisters expect me to embody devotion and calm, to inspire the crowd with faith. Yet, the architect expects precision and leadership from me at dawn. I feel the weight of both callings pressing on my chest. My hands, skilled with hammer and chisel, now tremble as I try to focus on the blueprints, but the prayer book on my desk draws my gaze. I want to serve both worlds fully, but tonight, I am torn, knowing I cannot be in two places at once."}
