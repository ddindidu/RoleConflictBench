The bail hearing had just ended, and the defendant\u2019s anxious family waited for my written order. The law was clear: I needed to draft and sign the release conditions immediately, ensuring every detail was precise. My clerk hovered nearby, reminding me of the urgency\u2014any delay meant the defendant would spend another night in custody.\n\nBut as I reached my chambers, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Ahmed, a gentle soul from the mosque. He\u2019d mentioned earlier that he needed to talk, nothing urgent, just whenever I had a moment. Now, his words echoed in my mind, \u201cWhenever you\u2019re free, Imam, I could use your advice.\u201d I knew from his tone that he was struggling, perhaps with his marriage or his faith.
