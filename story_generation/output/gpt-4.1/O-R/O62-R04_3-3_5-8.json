A quick inspection confirmed my fear: it was malfunctioning, and if left unchecked, the water could become unsafe for swimmers. I knew I had to act fast\u2014closing the pool and alerting maintenance was urgent. Just as I reached for my phone, it buzzed with a message from the mosque. A community member had arrived, desperate for guidance after a devastating loss, and was waiting for me in the prayer hall. As the imam, I was expected to offer comfort and spiritual support, especially in moments like this. My heart pounded as I stood between the pool and the mosque, torn by the weight of both responsibilities. The safety of swimmers and the emotional well-being of someone in pain both depended on me, but I could only be in one place at a time."}
