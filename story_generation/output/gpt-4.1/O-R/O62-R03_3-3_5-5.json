As I checked the filtration system, my heart sank\u2014the pressure gauge was in the red, and the water was already clouding. I knew this was serious; if I didn\u2019t act now, swimmers could be at risk. My training as a lifeguard demanded immediate attention: safety first, always. But as I reached for my phone to call maintenance, the convent bell tolled. Today, I was to lead the prayer vigil at the cathedral, a rare honor and a duty I could not take lightly. The sisters were counting on me to represent our faith, to guide the community in prayer. My hands trembled as I weighed the wrench in one hand and my rosary in the other, torn between the urgent call to protect lives and the sacred responsibility to my sisters and God. The minutes ticked by, each one tightening the knot in my chest, as I stood frozen between the pool and the chapel, unable to move."}
