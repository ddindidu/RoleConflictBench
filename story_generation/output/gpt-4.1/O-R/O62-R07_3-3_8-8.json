As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce every safety rule, no exceptions. The deep end was off-limits to children, yet I spotted a small boy flailing, his arms splashing in panic. My body tensed, ready to leap in, but my mind was elsewhere. My Buddhist teacher had just texted, reminding me to prepare a summary of the Four Noble Truths for tomorrow\u2019s temple session. I was supposed to be reflecting, studying, cultivating calm and insight. Instead, adrenaline surged through me, my thoughts torn between the urgent need to act and the quiet discipline of spiritual practice. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding immediate intervention, the other calling for mindful presence and preparation. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, caught between the whistle in my hand and the sutra in my mind."}
