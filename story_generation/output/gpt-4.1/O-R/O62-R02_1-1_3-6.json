As a lifeguard, I\u2019m expected to keep everything in order, so when I noticed a few pool chairs out of line, I felt that familiar tug of responsibility. They weren\u2019t broken, just a little askew, but I knew the manager expected everything to look perfect. I knelt to straighten them, but my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the planning meeting for the adult faith formation series at the church. As a priest, I\u2019m supposed to lead and inspire, and the committee relies on me to set the tone for the year. The meeting was starting soon, and I hadn\u2019t finished my notes. I stared at the chairs, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. Should I stay and make sure the pool is perfect, or rush off to fulfill my spiritual duties? The expectations from both sides felt impossible to meet at once, and I stood there, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that both needed me right now."}
