The evening chant at the temple was about to begin, and my mind drifted to the soft glow of candles, the rhythmic sound of voices rising in unison. I had promised the sangha I would be there, to help lead the ceremony. My phone buzzed with a gentle reminder: \u201cChanting starts in 10 minutes.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, a sharp beep jolted me back. A red alert flashed\u2014brake system malfunction. My training kicked in: I must report this immediately, stop the train, ensure everyone\u2019s safety. The passengers trusted me to get them home safely and on time. But if I stopped now, I\u2019d be late for the ceremony, letting down my community and breaking my commitment to the sangha.\n\nMy hands hovered over the controls, heart pounding. Duty to the passengers pressed on one side, the pull of my spiritual community on the other. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations heavy in my chest, as the train sped forward and the chanting bell echoed in my memory."}
