The tangles are stubborn, and I know I\u2019ll need extra time to work them out before I can even think about cutting. My client expects to leave here looking fresh, and I pride myself on never rushing a job. But as I rinse the suds away, my mind drifts to the Quran resting in my bag in the break room. Ramadan is halfway through, and I\u2019m already behind on my daily reading. I promised myself I\u2019d catch up today, but the appointments keep coming, and each head of hair brings its own challenge. My heart aches with guilt\u2014am I neglecting my faith for my work, or my work for my faith? The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I feel caught between the hum of the salon and the quiet call of reflection. The next client is already waiting, and I still haven\u2019t decided which role I\u2019ll let down."}
