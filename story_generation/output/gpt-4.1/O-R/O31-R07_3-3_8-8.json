As a police officer, I am expected to act with integrity and fairness, to provide honest testimony whenever called upon. Tomorrow, I am scheduled to appear in court, my presence crucial to a case that could change someone\u2019s life. Yet, as a Buddhist, my teacher has asked me to summarize key teachings for a temple session, also tomorrow. The Sangha expects me to engage in spiritual study and reflection, to guide others on the path of mindfulness and compassion. My mind churns with anxiety\u2014how can I be in two places at once, fulfilling both my duty to justice and my commitment to the Dharma? I feel the weight of both uniforms: the badge on my chest, the robe in my heart. The expectations press in from all sides, and I close my eyes, searching for clarity, torn between the demands of the world and the call of the spirit."}
