I smiled, welcoming them, feeling the weight of their expectations\u2014today, I was not just a hairdresser, but a calming presence, someone who could ease their anxiety and help the day begin right. As I led them to their seats, my phone buzzed in my pocket. A reminder: the children\u2019s religious education class was about to start at the parish hall across the street. As their priest, I was expected to be there, to guide and inspire, to answer questions and nurture faith. My heart pounded. The bride\u2019s eyes met mine, searching for reassurance, while in my mind I pictured the children gathering, waiting for me to lead them. I felt pulled in two directions, the scissors in my hand suddenly heavy, the collar at my neck tighter than usual. Both groups needed me, both counted on me to be present, to give them my best. I stood there, caught between the laughter and nerves of the bridal party and the quiet anticipation of my parish\u2019s children, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
