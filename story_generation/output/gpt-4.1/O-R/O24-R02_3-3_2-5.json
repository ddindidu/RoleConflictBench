The case file was thick, the situation urgent\u2014someone\u2019s safety might depend on my swift, careful judgment. I knew I had to review every detail, analyze the facts, and make a ruling within the hour. As I reached for the first page, my phone buzzed. It was the church secretary: a parishioner had arrived, sobbing and desperate, pleading for spiritual guidance in the sanctuary just across the street. As a priest, I was expected to offer comfort, to listen, to be present in their darkest hour. My mind raced\u2014justice demanded my focus, but compassion called me away. I felt the weight of both robes pressing down, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions. My hands trembled as I stared at the case file, hearing the echo of footsteps in the empty church, knowing someone waited for me there, too."}
