My fingers move quickly, scanning groceries, counting change, offering practiced smiles. As a cashier, I know the expectation: keep the line moving, no mistakes, no delays. But my mind is elsewhere. Sister Agnes is gravely ill, and the convent has called a special healing service\u2014one that begins in just fifteen minutes. As a nun, I am expected to be there, to pray, to support my sisters in faith. The weight of both roles presses on me. I glance at the clock, then at the faces in line, and then at the small cross beneath my uniform. My heart pounds with guilt and anxiety. If I leave, I let down my manager and the customers. If I stay, I abandon my community in their hour of need. The register beeps, the line shuffles forward, and I stand frozen, torn between duty and devotion, unable to move."}
