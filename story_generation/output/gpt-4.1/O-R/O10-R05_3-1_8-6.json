As the company\u2019s accountant, I was expected to respond quickly and diplomatically, to negotiate payment terms and reassure them that we valued their partnership. The pressure was mounting\u2014without their shipments, our operations would grind to a halt. My phone buzzed with a new message: a young couple, eager and hopeful, asking if I could officiate their wedding next summer. As their rabbi, I knew how much this moment meant to them, how important it was to offer warmth and certainty. But the wedding date fell during our busiest financial quarter, when I\u2019d be needed most at the office. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my profession and the sacred trust of my calling. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting my full presence, each unwilling to wait. My hands hovered over the keyboard, caught between two lives, unsure which promise to keep."}
