She needed a deep wash and careful conditioning before I could even think about cutting\u2014anything less would be unprofessional, even unsafe. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart thudded. In less than an hour, I was expected at the cathedral, not just to pray, but to lead the vigil, representing my entire convent. The sisters had entrusted me with this honor, and the community would be watching. Yet here I was, sleeves rolled up, wrestling with knots and buildup, my scissors useless until I did right by my client. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the duty to care for those who sat in my chair, and the sacred responsibility to my faith and sisters. My mind raced, torn between the gentle patience my client deserved and the reverence demanded by my calling. The minutes slipped away, and I stood frozen, caught between the hum of the salon and the silent pull of the sanctuary."}
