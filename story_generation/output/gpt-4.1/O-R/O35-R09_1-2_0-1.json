The intercom crackles with reminders about punctuality\u2014every minute counts, and the city depends on me to keep the trains running safely and on time. My supervisor expects nothing less than precision, even for these non-critical systems. But my mind drifts to the synagogue classroom, where a group of eager children waits for me. The holiday is almost here, and they still stumble over the blessings, their voices uncertain. I promised their parents I\u2019d help them understand the traditions, to pass on the words and melodies that shaped my own childhood. The weight of both roles presses on me: the city\u2019s schedule in one hand, the future of my community in the other. I glance at my watch, feeling the minutes slip away, torn between the responsibility to my passengers and the promise I made to those children. My heart pounds as I realize I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the decision looms, heavy and unresolved."}
