The house was quiet, no car in the driveway, no lights on. As a delivery person, I was supposed to make sure the package was safe, confirm delivery, and move on. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the Martinez family, reminding me about the final preparation session for their daughter\u2019s sacrament tonight. As their priest, I knew how important this was; the family had been anxious, and this session was mandatory before the ceremony tomorrow. I glanced at my watch. If I left the package now, unattended, it might get stolen or soaked. But if I delayed, I\u2019d be late for the class, letting down the family and the children waiting at the church. My mind raced, torn between my duty to secure someone\u2019s belongings and my responsibility to guide a child through a sacred milestone. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, and I stood frozen on the porch, heart pounding, unable to move."}
