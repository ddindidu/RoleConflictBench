I force a smile as the next customer slams a broken toy on the counter, voice sharp and accusing. \u201cYou sold me junk!\u201d she snaps. My training as a cashier echoes in my mind: stay calm, be friendly, make it right. I apologize, offering to exchange the toy, but she grows louder, demanding a refund and muttering insults under her breath. My cheeks burn, but I keep my tone even, trying to soothe her.\n\nThen, as I open the register, I notice a $50 bill stuck behind the drawer\u2014clearly dropped by the previous customer, who has already left. The angry woman sees it too, and her eyes narrow. \u201cThat\u2019s mine,\u201d she says, though I know it isn\u2019t. My heart pounds. As a Christian, I\u2019m taught to be honest, to do what\u2019s right even when it\u2019s hard. But the store is packed, my manager is watching, and the woman is growing more aggressive. I feel torn between my duty to serve the customer and my commitment to my faith. My hands tremble as I weigh what to do next."}
