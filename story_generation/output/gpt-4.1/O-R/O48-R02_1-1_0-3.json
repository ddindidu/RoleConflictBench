I glanced at the screen and saw a message from Mark, a parishioner who\u2019d been struggling lately. \u201cCould we talk soon? Even just a few minutes,\u201d he wrote. As a nursing assistant, my priority was clear: Mrs. Evans needed help with her meal, and the other residents would soon need assistance with bathing and dressing. But as a priest, I felt the weight of Mark\u2019s request\u2014he rarely reached out, and I knew how much courage it took for him to ask. My supervisor expected me to stay focused on my duties, and the residents depended on my presence. Yet, my heart ached at the thought of leaving Mark waiting, possibly feeling abandoned by his spiritual guide. I stood there, torn, the spoon paused in midair, wrestling with the impossible choice between the immediate physical needs before me and the quiet, urgent plea for spiritual support."}
