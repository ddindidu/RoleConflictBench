My team expected me to keep everything on track, to catch delays before they became disasters. I glanced at the clock\u2014tasks were moving, but not as quickly as they should. I knew I should dig deeper, send reminders, maybe even stay late to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks. \n\nBut tonight was the temple\u2019s evening chant, a ritual I rarely missed. My Buddhist community counted on my presence, not just as a participant but as someone who helped lead the ceremony. The thought of the incense, the rhythmic chanting, the peace it brought, tugged at me. Yet, the weight of my architectural responsibilities pressed just as hard. If I left now, I risked letting my team down. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the spiritual grounding I so desperately needed. My mind spun, caught between the demands of efficiency and the call to mindfulness, unable to quiet the storm inside."}
