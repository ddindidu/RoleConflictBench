Most days, the calls were routine\u2014customers asked about the product, I answered with practiced ease, and objections were met with lines I\u2019d memorized long ago. But today, my mind wandered. In just an hour, I was supposed to meet with Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation who\u2019d reached out for spiritual guidance. She\u2019d sounded desperate on the phone, her voice trembling as she asked for help with a struggle she couldn\u2019t name.\n\nAs I fielded another call, a customer\u2019s question barely registered. My thoughts kept drifting to Mrs. Carter, to the expectation that I would listen, counsel, and offer comfort. Yet here I was, expected to be persuasive, focused, and efficient, not compassionate or contemplative. The demands of both roles pressed in on me\u2014one required empathy and patience, the other demanded quick thinking and salesmanship. My chest tightened as I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which part of myself I could afford to neglect."}
