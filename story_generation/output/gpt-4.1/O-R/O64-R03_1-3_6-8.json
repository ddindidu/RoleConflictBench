A few customers trickle in, and I greet each with a warm smile, making small talk as I bag their groceries. My manager expects me to be cheerful and attentive, to make every customer feel welcome. But my mind drifts to the convent, where the Mother Superior has just asked me to lead daily reflections for the upcoming retreat. It\u2019s an honor, but it means hours of preparation\u2014reading, prayer, and deep contemplation. As I hand a receipt to a customer, I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. Here, I must be present, friendly, efficient. There, I am called to be thoughtful, serene, and spiritually focused. I worry I won\u2019t have the time or energy to do justice to either role. My heart aches with the fear of disappointing my sisters or failing my duties at the store. The next customer approaches, and I force another smile, my mind torn between the ringing register and the silent chapel."}
