As a lawyer, I was expected to review a complex purchase agreement before the filing deadline tomorrow. The contract sprawled across my desk, dense with clauses demanding my full attention. Yet, as a nun, my heart was pulled toward the chapel, where a special healing service was about to begin for Sister Agnes, who had fallen gravely ill. The community needed my prayers and presence, especially tonight. My legal mind urged me to stay, to analyze every word and safeguard my client\u2019s interests. But my spiritual vows whispered that compassion and solidarity were just as vital. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my undivided devotion. My hands trembled as I hovered between the contract and my rosary, torn by the impossible choice before me."}
