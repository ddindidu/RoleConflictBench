Dispatch had just called in: a man in his fifties, severe chest pain, possible heart attack. I knew every second counted. As an ambulance driver, I was trained to focus, to push aside everything but the patient\u2019s survival. But my phone buzzed on the dashboard\u2014a reminder of the bar mitzvah I was supposed to officiate in less than an hour. The family had been preparing for months, their expectations resting on my shoulders as their rabbi. I pictured the boy, nervous and proud, his family gathered, waiting for me to guide him through this sacred rite of passage. My heart twisted. I could hear the echo of their voices, the weight of their trust. Yet here I was, racing toward a stranger whose life might depend on my hands. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each urgent, each sacred. I gripped the wheel tighter, torn between two worlds, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
