The next fare would be here any minute, and I prided myself on keeping my taxi spotless\u2014no crumbs, no stains, no lingering smells. My regulars expected nothing less, and I needed every tip I could get. Just as I finished straightening the seatbelt, my phone buzzed. It was Mrs. Alvarez, her message urgent: \u201cFather, can you please meet us tonight? The sacrament is tomorrow, and we need the final session for Maria.\u201d I knew how important this was for their family, and as their priest, I was responsible for guiding them through this sacred milestone. But my shift wasn\u2019t over, and I had promised my dispatcher I\u2019d cover the evening rush. If I left now, I\u2019d let down my passengers and risk my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d fail a family counting on me for spiritual guidance. My hands trembled as I stared at the steering wheel, torn between the cab and the church, between duty and devotion, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
