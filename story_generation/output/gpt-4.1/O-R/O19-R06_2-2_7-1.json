As a pharmacist, I knew how important it was to stay updated\u2014patients depended on me for safe, accurate advice. The session turned to a new medication, one that could be used for purposes my faith taught me to question. My mind raced. Professionally, I was expected to counsel patients without judgment, to provide information and support regardless of my personal beliefs. But as a Christian, I felt a deep responsibility to live by my values, to consider the moral weight of my actions.\n\nThe speaker handed out case studies, and I saw one that hit close to home\u2014a scenario where a patient requested the medication for a use my church had spoken against. My heart pounded. I could already imagine the patient\u2019s hopeful face, the trust in their eyes. I could also hear the quiet voice of my faith, urging me to stand firm in my convictions. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt caught in the middle, uncertain which path I could walk without betraying a part of myself."}
