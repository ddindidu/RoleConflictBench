As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to handle every objection with a smile, to answer questions quickly and keep the call moving. Most days, the callers are polite, and their questions are the same ones I\u2019ve rehearsed a hundred times. But today, as I dial the next number, I feel the familiar urge to repeat my mantra, a quiet thread of devotion that keeps me grounded as a Hindu. I try to whisper it under my breath, hoping it will bring me peace, but my supervisor\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cStay focused, listen carefully.\u201d The customer on the line asks about our product, and I catch myself stumbling, my mind split between the script and the sacred words. I want to honor my faith, even in this small way, but the pressure to perform, to be present and attentive, tugs me in the opposite direction. My heart pounds as I realize I can\u2019t do both at once, and I sit frozen, torn between the demands of my job and the quiet call of my beliefs."}
