The material waste was piling up, and I knew my responsibility was to step in, correct him, and guide him firmly\u2014maybe even report the repeated mistakes. My supervisor expected me to be assertive, to protect the company\u2019s resources and teach the operator the right way.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from a member of my congregation, desperate for guidance. She was in crisis, her voice trembling over the phone, her choices weighing heavily on her soul. As her pastor, I was expected to listen, to offer compassion and wisdom, to be present for her in her darkest hour.\n\nI felt torn, standing between the clatter of machines and the silent plea for spiritual help. Both needed me now, both expected my full attention and care. My hands shook as I weighed the demands\u2014should I confront the operator, or step away to answer the call for spiritual guidance? The pressure of these two worlds pressed in, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, unable to move."}
