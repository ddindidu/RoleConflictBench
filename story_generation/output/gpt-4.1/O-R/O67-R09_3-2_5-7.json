Dispatch had said it was a major heart attack\u2014every second mattered. I glanced at the clock. In less than an hour, I was supposed to be at synagogue, chanting my portion, something I\u2019d practiced for weeks. My family and community expected me there; it was my honor, my duty. But now, as I pulled up to the patient\u2019s house, I felt the weight of my other responsibility pressing down. The man inside needed me\u2014needed my training, my calm, my care. I could already hear the rabbi\u2019s voice in my head, the disappointment if I didn\u2019t show. My heart pounded with the urgency of both calls, torn between saving a life and fulfilling a sacred promise. I hesitated for a split second, caught between the blare of the ambulance and the quiet sanctity of the synagogue, not knowing which demand to answer first."}
