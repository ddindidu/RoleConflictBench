A customer wanted an update on their package, and I knew I had to respond quickly and professionally. I pulled over, ready to type a polite message, when I noticed the community center across the street. Inside, a small group had gathered, and I remembered I was scheduled to share a short religious story as their pastor. I hurried in, greeted everyone warmly, and began telling the parable I\u2019d prepared. Just as I reached the story\u2019s moral, my phone vibrated again\u2014another message from the waiting customer, growing impatient. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the expectation to be present and inspiring as a pastor, and the demand to be responsive and courteous as a delivery person. My mind raced, torn between finishing my story with the care it deserved and stepping aside to address the customer\u2019s concerns. The tension knotted in my chest, and I realized I couldn\u2019t meet both expectations at once."}
