The email from the external auditor flashes on my screen, urgent and insistent: they need the quarterly financial statements now, not tomorrow. As the company\u2019s accountant, I know the records must be flawless\u2014every number checked, every document in order. My supervisor expects nothing less, and the pressure to deliver is suffocating. Yet, my phone vibrates with a gentle reminder: the weekly group meditation begins in ten minutes. As a practicing Buddhist, I promised myself to never miss these sessions, to honor the commitment to mindfulness and inner peace. The group expects my presence, and I crave the calm that meditation brings. But the spreadsheets on my screen blur as anxiety rises. I feel torn, pulled between the relentless demands of accuracy and deadlines, and the quiet call to sit, breathe, and let go. My hands hover over the keyboard, mind racing, as I wrestle with the impossible choice between duty and devotion."}
