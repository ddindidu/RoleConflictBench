My client, Mrs. Lee, relied on me to keep her home spotless, and I knew she expected everything to be ready for her next cleaning in three days. I made a mental note to pick up more supplies before then. But as I checked my calendar, I realized the only time I could get to the store was Sunday morning\u2014the same time as church service. My church community counted on me to be present, to worship together and help with the after-service lunch. I felt a knot in my stomach. If I skipped church, I\u2019d disappoint my pastor and friends, and I\u2019d miss the spiritual renewal I needed. But if I didn\u2019t buy the cleaner, I\u2019d let down Mrs. Lee and risk my job. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I found myself torn, standing in the hallway with the empty bottle in my hand, unsure which expectation I could bear to break."}
