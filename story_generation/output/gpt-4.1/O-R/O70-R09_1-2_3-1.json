As a delivery person, I knew the drill: leave the box somewhere safe, snap a photo, confirm the drop-off. But my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014Passover was just days away, and I still hadn\u2019t taught my kids the blessings for the Seder. My supervisor expected me to finish my route on time, no excuses. But at home, my children waited, counting on me to share the stories and songs my parents once taught me. I felt the weight of the package and the weight of tradition pressing equally on my shoulders. If I rushed, maybe I\u2019d make it home before bedtime, but if I cut corners, I risked a complaint or worse. My mind spun with the demands of both worlds, neither willing to let go."}
