The evening shift is always busy, but tonight feels heavier. Mrs. Thompson, in room 204, is wincing with every movement, her hands trembling as she tries to lift her spoon. I know she needs help\u2014gentle encouragement, maybe even feeding her, if the pain is too much. That\u2019s my duty as a nursing assistant: to be present, patient, and compassionate, especially when someone is suffering.\n\nBut tonight is also the community Quran study circle. I promised myself I\u2019d be there, to recite and reflect on the verses we\u2019re discussing. I haven\u2019t read them yet, and I feel a knot of guilt in my stomach. My faith asks for my time, my focus, my heart. The group expects me to be prepared, to contribute thoughtfully.\n\nStanding in the hallway, I feel pulled in two directions. My hands ache to help Mrs. Thompson, but my mind is racing with the verses I haven\u2019t read. I can\u2019t ignore either call, but I can\u2019t answer both at once. The weight of these expectations presses down on me, and I close my eyes, caught in the struggle of who I need to be, and who I want to be, tonight."}
