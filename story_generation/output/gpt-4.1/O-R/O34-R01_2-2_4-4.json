Pilots\u2019 voices crackled in, tense and expectant, waiting for my revised climb instructions. My mind raced, calculating altitudes and safe vectors, every second critical. Just then, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. \u201cCan you talk? It\u2019s urgent. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\u201d I knew her family was in crisis, and she needed me to listen, to offer comfort and guidance. My heart twisted. The pilots depended on my focus to keep them safe, but Sarah needed my compassion, my presence as her pastor. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, the demands of the sky and the needs of the soul, each expecting my undivided attention. My hands hovered over the controls, my mind torn, as I wrestled with which voice to answer first."}
