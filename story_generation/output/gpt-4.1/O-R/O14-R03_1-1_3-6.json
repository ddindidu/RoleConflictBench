My research notes from this morning\u2019s experiment were scattered before me, waiting to be organized and entered into the official log. As a scientist, I knew the importance of documenting findings while details were fresh, ensuring accuracy and integrity. Yet, the routine logs could wait; there was no immediate deadline, and I could easily update them later.\n\nBut as a nun, I had set aside this quiet afternoon for spiritual study and reflection\u2014a rare, precious time for personal prayer and reading. The convent was unusually still, sunlight streaming through stained glass, inviting me to step away from the world of data and immerse myself in contemplation.\n\nI felt the pull from both sides: the duty to my research, the call to my faith. My mind raced with the tension between the need for scientific precision and the longing for spiritual nourishment. I stared at the open logbook and the worn pages of my prayer journal, heart heavy, torn between two worlds that rarely seemed to meet."}
