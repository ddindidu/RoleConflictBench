My mind, though, was far from the station. In a few hours, I was expected at the synagogue, where the sanctuary would fill with families awaiting my High Holiday sermon. The words I\u2019d prepared still felt unfinished, swirling in my head, demanding my focus. Yet, as an ambulance driver, I couldn\u2019t let my guard down. Every second, I had to be ready\u2014if a call came, I\u2019d need to respond instantly, lives depending on my speed and attention. The weight of both roles pressed on me: my congregation counting on spiritual guidance, my community relying on my swift response in crisis. I glanced at my notes, then at the radio, heart pounding. If a call came now, I\u2019d have to choose\u2014rush to save a life, or fulfill my sacred duty at the bimah. The clock ticked closer to the service, and I felt the tension coil tighter inside me, torn between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
