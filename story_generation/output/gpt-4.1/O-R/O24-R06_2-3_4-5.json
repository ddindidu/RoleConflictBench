As a judge, I was expected to write a clear, thorough judgment within the next thirty days\u2014every word scrutinized, every fact weighed. The legal community, the parties, and my own sense of duty demanded nothing less than precision and diligence. Yet, as Sunday approached, my phone buzzed with reminders from my church group: worship service, choir practice, and the monthly outreach event. My faith called me to be present, to worship, to serve, to be a visible part of the community. I felt the pull of both worlds\u2014one demanding my mind and time for justice, the other my heart and presence for faith. The clock ticked, my calendar filled, and I felt the tension growing inside me, torn between the silent courtroom and the singing congregation, knowing I could not give both all they deserved."}
