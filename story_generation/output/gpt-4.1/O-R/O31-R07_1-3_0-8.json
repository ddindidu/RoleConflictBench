I had promised my teacher I\u2019d summarize the Four Noble Truths for tomorrow\u2019s temple session, and I wanted to do it justice. But duty called\u2014a noise complaint, a late-night party disturbing the peace. As a police officer, I was expected to respond immediately, to enforce the law and restore order. Yet, as a Buddhist, I felt the weight of my commitment to spiritual study, to reflection and preparation for the teaching I\u2019d been entrusted with. My mind tugged in two directions: the urgency of the uniform, the quiet pull of the saffron robe. I could hear the distant thump of music through my open window, and the gentle rustle of pages in my lap. My heart pounded with the stress of incompatible demands, knowing that whichever path I chose tonight, I would be letting someone down\u2014my community, or my sangha. I closed my eyes, searching for clarity, but the conflict only grew sharper in the silence."}
