High tide always made me tense\u2014waves crashed, children shrieked, and I knew a single lapse could mean disaster. Yet, as the clock ticked closer to noon, my heart pounded for another reason. Today was the holiest day in our calendar, and the congregation would soon gather, waiting for me to lead the prayers, to offer guidance and hope. I could almost hear the church bells in the distance, calling me to my other duty. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cService begins in 30 minutes.\u201d I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the red of my lifeguard shirt, the white of my priest\u2019s collar\u2014pressing on my chest. The beach needed my vigilance; the community needed my faith. I stood at the edge of the water, torn, the expectations of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which call I could answer without failing the other."}
