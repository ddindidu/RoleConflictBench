As a judge, I knew the expectation: every detail must be reviewed, every argument weighed with care. The case was complex, and my decision would affect many lives. Yet, as I tried to focus, the distant sound of drums and laughter drifted through my window. Today was a special festival in our community, one I had celebrated since childhood. The scent of incense and marigold garlands lingered in the air, and I could see neighbors gathering in colorful attire, preparing for the evening\u2019s rituals.\n\nMy heart ached with longing. As a Hindu, I was expected to join, to honor tradition and family, to be present in the joy and devotion of the festival. But the files on my desk demanded my attention, and the weight of my judicial responsibility pressed down on me. I found myself torn, my mind wandering between the solemn duty of my profession and the vibrant call of my faith. The clock ticked on, and I sat in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice between the two worlds that defined me."}
