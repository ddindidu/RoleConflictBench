My supervisor had already sent a reminder this morning: \u201cNo early breaks, please. We need all hands on deck.\u201d But today was Friday, and the mosque was just across the street. I had my abaya and scarf folded neatly in my bag, ready to change before entering the main prayer hall for Jummah. The expectation was clear: I needed to dress modestly, as my faith required, before stepping inside. \n\nBut if I waited until my break to change, I\u2019d be late for the prayer. If I left my desk even a few minutes early, it would show up in the system, and I\u2019d have to explain myself\u2014again. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands: the pressure to follow company policy, the spiritual importance of being present and properly dressed for worship. I stared at my headset, torn between the two worlds, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing second."}
