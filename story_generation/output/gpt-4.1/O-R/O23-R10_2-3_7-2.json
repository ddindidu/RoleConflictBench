The scent of sandalwood still lingered on my clothes as I reviewed my client\u2019s files, preparing for a crucial meeting. Just as I was about to leave for my midday puja, my assistant, new to our firm and unaware of the case\u2019s sensitivity, approached me. She asked for access to the confidential files, explaining it would help her organize the paperwork more efficiently. As a lawyer, I knew the rules\u2014client confidentiality is sacred, and sharing information, even internally, could breach ethical standards. Yet, as a Hindu, I felt the pressure of time; my daily rituals must be performed at precise moments, and any delay would disrupt the spiritual discipline I\u2019ve maintained for years. My mind raced, torn between the duty to uphold my profession\u2019s integrity and the devotion that anchors my spiritual life. The clock ticked, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my unwavering commitment."}
