My headset pressed against my veil, a constant reminder of the two worlds I straddled. The phone list glared at me, names and numbers waiting to be dialed, each call a chance to meet the quota my manager would surely ask about tomorrow. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but my heart was elsewhere. Down the hall, the chapel bell chimed, calling the sisters to a special healing service for Sister Agnes, who had grown so frail these past weeks. The Mother Superior\u2019s gentle words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe must be present for one another, especially in times of need.\u201d I felt the weight of expectation from both sides\u2014my supervisor\u2019s sharp reminders about performance, and my community\u2019s silent plea for solidarity and prayer. My chest tightened as I stared at the phone, torn between the demands of my job and the call to serve my sisters in faith."}
