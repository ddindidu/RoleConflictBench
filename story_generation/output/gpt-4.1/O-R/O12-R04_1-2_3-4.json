The product team had finally scheduled the much-anticipated brainstorming session for next Friday, right in the middle of the afternoon. Attendance was marked as optional, but I knew how much my input mattered\u2014my ideas had shaped features before, and my manager expected me to help bridge the gap between development and design. Yet, that same Friday, I was also listed as the sole khatib for the congregational prayer. The community had already shared the topic I\u2019d chosen, and several people had told me how much they were looking forward to it. I could picture the faces of the regulars, the anticipation in their eyes. My mind raced with the weight of both roles: the team counting on my technical insight, the congregation relying on my spiritual guidance. I felt a knot tighten in my chest as I tried to imagine disappointing either group, knowing that no matter what I chose, someone would be let down."}
