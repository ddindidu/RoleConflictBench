She looked up at me with tired eyes and asked if I could stay a little longer, just to talk. As a nursing assistant, I know how important it is to provide emotional support and companionship, especially to patients who feel isolated. I pulled up a chair, and she began to share stories from her youth, her voice trembling with nostalgia and sadness.\n\nThen, her words shifted. She confided in me about a decision she made long ago, one that went against everything I was taught to believe as a Christian. She asked for my opinion, searching my face for comfort and understanding. My heart pounded. I wanted to be there for her, to offer the support she needed, but I also felt the weight of my faith, the expectation to uphold my values and not condone what I believe is wrong. I could feel the tension rising inside me, torn between my duty to comfort her without judgment and my desire to remain true to my beliefs."}
