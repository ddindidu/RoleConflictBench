My experiment, the culmination of years of research, needed this window. The data I could gather would be crucial for my upcoming funding review. As I prepped the lab, my phone buzzed urgently. News of a devastating fire had swept through the community overnight. Several families from my congregation had lost their homes. My role as pastor demanded I be there, to comfort, to organize shelter and support, to be the steady presence they needed in crisis. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my colleagues expected me in the lab, my congregation needed me at their side. My hands trembled as I stared at my lab notebook, then at my phone, torn between the pursuit of knowledge and the call to compassion, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
