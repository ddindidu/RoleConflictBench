As a hairdresser, I knew I needed to wash and condition it thoroughly before I could even think about cutting\u2014otherwise, my scissors would snag and the result would be a mess. But as I gently explained the situation, she grew defensive, her cheeks flushing. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for a wash today,\u201d she snapped, her voice tight. I felt the familiar tug of my other role, the one that asked me to show love and kindness, to be patient and gentle, just as Jesus taught. I wanted to offer a small gesture of understanding, maybe a reassuring word or a smile, but the professional in me knew I couldn\u2019t ignore the state of her hair. My mind raced, caught between the need to do my job properly and the call to treat her with compassion, even as she bristled at my suggestion. I could feel the tension building inside me, the weight of two expectations pulling me in opposite directions, and I hesitated, unsure of which path to take."}
