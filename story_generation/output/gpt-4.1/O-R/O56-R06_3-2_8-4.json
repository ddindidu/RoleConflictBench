The buildup was worse than I\u2019d expected, and I knew I\u2019d need extra time to wash and condition before I could even think about cutting. My scissors would snag and pull otherwise, and I prided myself on never causing my clients pain. But as I massaged the shampoo into her scalp, my phone buzzed with a reminder: church service started in thirty minutes. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss another Sunday, not after last week\u2019s absence. My pastor always said that worship wasn\u2019t just a duty, but a privilege\u2014a way to stay connected to God and my community. Yet here I was, hands full of suds, knowing Mrs. Kim depended on me to do my job right. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down, my heart torn between serving my client with care and honoring my commitment to my faith."}
