The customer had ordered a moderately expensive gadget, and company policy was clear: I needed a signature. As I rang the bell, I rehearsed my usual line about confirming delivery. The door opened, and before I could speak, Mrs. Carter\u2014one of my parishioners\u2014stood there, her eyes red and swollen. She barely glanced at the box. \u201cPastor, do you have a minute?\u201d she whispered, voice trembling. \u201cIt\u2019s about my son. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\u201d\n\nMy delivery scanner beeped, reminding me of the ticking clock and the need for her signature. But her pain was raw, and as her pastor, I knew she needed more than a quick word. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me: the crisp shirt of the delivery company, the invisible collar of my calling. I could see the expectation in her eyes\u2014support, guidance, hope. But the company expected efficiency, proof of delivery, no delays. My heart pounded as I stood on her porch, torn between the demands of my job and the needs of my flock, unsure which duty to fulfill first."}
