Their arms were full of heavy suitcases, and they looked exhausted. \u201cCan you help us load these? We\u2019ll split the fare,\u201d one of them asked, smiling hopefully. As a taxi driver, I knew what was expected: be courteous, help with luggage, and make sure the ride is smooth and fair. Tips often depended on that extra bit of service. But as I lifted the first suitcase, my mind wandered to the envelope of savings tucked away at home\u2014money I\u2019d been setting aside for years, hoping to join my friends on Hajj this season. Every extra bit I earned brought me closer, but every act of generosity or leniency\u2014like waiving a luggage fee or accepting a split fare\u2014meant a little less for my pilgrimage. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to serve my passengers well, and the longing to fulfill my religious obligation. I stood there, suitcase in hand, caught between the expectations of my job and the dream I\u2019d carried for so long."}
