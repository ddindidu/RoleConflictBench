As I walked along the edge, I noticed a lane rope had snapped, its frayed ends floating in the water. Swim lessons would start in less than an hour, and without that rope, the class would be chaotic and unsafe. I knew it was my responsibility as a lifeguard to fix it immediately\u2014parents and children depended on me to keep things running smoothly.\n\nBut as I reached for the repair kit, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was the sole imam scheduled to deliver the Friday sermon in just a couple of hours. The community had been looking forward to my talk, and the mosque had already announced the topic. There was no one else to step in at the last minute. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to maintain safety at the pool and the spiritual duty I owed to my congregation. Both roles demanded my presence, both were counting on me, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in from all sides."}
