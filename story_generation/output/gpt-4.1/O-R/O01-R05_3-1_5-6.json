The operating rooms needed to be perfectly placed, the emergency routes direct and unobstructed\u2014lives would depend on my attention to every detail. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the message: a young couple from my congregation, asking if I could officiate their wedding next spring. They wanted to set the date, to know I\u2019d be there to bless their union.\n\nI felt the familiar tug between my two worlds. As an architect, I was expected to be available for site visits, last-minute meetings, and the inevitable crises that came with a project of this scale. As a rabbi, I was a guide through sacred moments, a steady presence in times of joy and sorrow. The hospital\u2019s construction timeline was uncertain, and I couldn\u2019t guarantee I\u2019d be free on their chosen day. My mind raced with the weight of both responsibilities, the fear of letting down my clients or my community pressing in on me. I stared at the message, heart pounding, caught between the blueprints and the blessings."}
