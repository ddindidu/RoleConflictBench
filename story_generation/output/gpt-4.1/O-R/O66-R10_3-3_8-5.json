As a taxi driver, I knew I was expected to be quick, reliable, and professional\u2014my rating depended on it. But as I turned a corner, I saw a man in a suit slipping a thick envelope to a police officer, who quickly tucked it away. The officer then waved off a street vendor who looked terrified, his cart half-emptied. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act when I saw injustice or corruption. I felt the weight of my beliefs urging me to intervene, to at least record or report what I\u2019d seen. But the passenger\u2019s messages kept coming, and I knew stopping would make me late, risking my job and disappointing someone who trusted me. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between my duty to my passenger and my duty to my conscience, caught in a moment where both roles demanded something I couldn\u2019t give at once."}
