Fever, joint pain, a strange rash\u2014none of it fit neatly into any diagnosis I knew. As a doctor, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing on me; my patient was waiting for answers, and I owed them my best effort, no matter how late it got. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was David from the synagogue. They needed one more person for the minyan to say Kaddish at a funeral, and I was the only one nearby. As a Jew, I knew how important it was to help a fellow congregant honor the dead, especially when every person counted. My mind raced. If I left now, I\u2019d let my patient wait even longer for a diagnosis. If I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down my community at a sacred moment. The expectations of both roles pulled at me, and I felt torn, caught between my duty to heal and my duty to my faith."}
