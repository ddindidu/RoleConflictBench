The evidence was tangled, the testimonies conflicting, but the law demands clarity. I must write a detailed judgment, laying out every fact and legal conclusion, and I know the court expects nothing less than precision and impartiality from me. Yet, as I review my notes, a gnawing discomfort grows. I witnessed something during the trial\u2014an act of corruption, subtle but unmistakable, that threatens to undermine justice itself. My upbringing as a Hindu taught me to stand against adharma, to act with courage and integrity when faced with wrongdoing. The urge to expose the truth, to take a moral stand, is overwhelming. But as a judge, I am bound by procedure, by the evidence presented, not by what I suspect or feel. The expectations of my role as a judge and my duty as a Hindu are pulling me in opposite directions, and I find myself paralyzed, pen poised above the page, heart pounding with the weight of what I must\u2014or must not\u2014do."}
