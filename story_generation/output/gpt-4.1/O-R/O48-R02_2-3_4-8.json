Still, protocol demanded I monitor her closely, especially after her recent procedure. My mind, however, was already drifting to the church hall, where the Martinez family waited for me. Their son\u2019s sacrament was this weekend, and tonight\u2019s session was the last chance to prepare him. They\u2019d pleaded for this final class, and I\u2019d promised to be there. \n\nBut now, Mrs. Lee\u2019s numbers nagged at me. Should I stay and keep checking her vitals, as a good nursing assistant should, or trust she\u2019ll be fine and slip away to fulfill my promise as a priest?

I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between duty and devotion, unable to move."}
