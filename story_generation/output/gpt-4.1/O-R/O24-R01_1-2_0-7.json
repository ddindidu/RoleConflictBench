As a judge, I was expected to review every detail, no matter how routine the case seemed. The hearing was in two weeks, but I knew the importance of being prepared\u2014justice demanded diligence. Yet, on the other side of my desk, my Bible lay open, notes for Sunday\u2019s sermon scattered around it. My congregation looked to me for guidance, for words that would help them navigate the moral complexities of their lives. I was supposed to teach them about forgiveness and compassion, to help them see the world through the lens of faith. But as I tried to focus on the legal documents, my mind kept drifting to the sermon, to the responsibility I felt for the souls in my care. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be wholly present. I felt torn, caught between the law and the spirit, unsure which duty to serve first."}
