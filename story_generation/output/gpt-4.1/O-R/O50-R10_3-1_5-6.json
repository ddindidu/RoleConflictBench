As the repairer, I knew what was expected of me\u2014drop everything, grab my tools, and get that machine running before the whole line ground to a halt. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me that downtime meant lost money and angry calls from management. But as I hurried toward the noise, the scent of incense drifted through the open window. Outside, the street was alive with color and music; today was the festival of Holi. My community expected me to join, to smear colors, offer prayers, and celebrate with my family. I paused, torn between the screeching machine and the laughter outside. My hands itched for the wrench, but my heart ached for the rituals and the sense of belonging. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood frozen, caught between the demands of my work and the pull of my faith, unsure which call to answer first."}
