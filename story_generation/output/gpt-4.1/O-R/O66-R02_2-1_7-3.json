They looked exhausted, and as I stepped out to help load their bags, they explained they wanted to split the fare. I nodded, already calculating the best route and how to handle the payment professionally, as any good driver should. Just as I was about to close the trunk, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a parishioner. She asked if I might have time soon to talk, hinting at something weighing on her heart. As a priest, I knew I should respond with warmth and openness, ready to offer guidance. But right now, my focus was supposed to be on my passengers, ensuring their journey was smooth and their request handled fairly. I felt the tension rise inside me, torn between the immediate demands of my job and the deeper calling to be present for someone in spiritual need. My hands hesitated on the trunk, my mind pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
