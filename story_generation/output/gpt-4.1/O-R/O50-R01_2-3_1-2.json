I was elbow-deep in the main production unit, sweat beading on my brow as I traced the source of the sensor errors that had halted everything for half an hour. The supervisor\u2019s anxious eyes followed my every move\u2014every minute lost meant mounting costs and frustrated workers. I was just about to test a theory when my phone vibrated again, this time with a message from the church secretary: \u201cUrgent\u2014Sarah needs you. She\u2019s in crisis. Says she can\u2019t wait.\u201d My heart clenched. Sarah\u2019s choices could change her life forever, and she was reaching out for spiritual guidance, for a steady hand and a listening ear. But here, the machines demanded my focus, the team expected answers, and the pressure to restore order was suffocating. I stared at my hands, torn between the cold logic of wires and sensors and the warm, aching need of a soul in distress, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose."}
