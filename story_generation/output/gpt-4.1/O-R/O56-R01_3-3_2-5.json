The bride-to-be and her bridesmaids rushed in, their faces tight with worry. I smiled, ushering them to their seats, offering tea, trying to ease their nerves. My hands moved quickly, curling and pinning, but my mind was elsewhere. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014three missed calls from the church deacon. A flash flood had hit the outskirts of town. Families were stranded, some had lost everything. As their pastor, I was expected to be there, to comfort, to organize help, to pray with the grieving. But here, as a hairdresser, I was expected to calm these anxious women, to make this day perfect for the bride. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, my heart torn between the needs of my clients and the cries of my community. I glanced at the bride\u2019s hopeful eyes in the mirror, then at my phone, vibrating again with urgency."}
