As a taxi driver, I was expected to drive carefully, obey every traffic law, and keep my passengers safe, especially on a day like this when cars darted between lanes and brake lights flashed unpredictably. But today wasn\u2019t just any day. My family was waiting for me at home, the house fragrant with incense and marigolds for the puja. As a Hindu, I was expected to arrive on time, dressed in my best, to honor the gods and my family\u2019s traditions. My phone buzzed with a message from my wife: \u201cDon\u2019t be late. Everyone is waiting.\u201d I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. If I rushed, I might make it, but the roads demanded patience and caution. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to speed up, torn between my duty to my passengers and my devotion to my family and faith."}
