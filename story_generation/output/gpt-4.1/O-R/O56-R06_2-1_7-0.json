As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to wash and condition every client\u2019s hair before I cut or style it, no matter what. It\u2019s part of the job, and it\u2019s about giving everyone the same care and respect. But as I led her to the sink, I felt a familiar tug inside me. My Christian values remind me to treat everyone with kindness and humility, to serve without complaint, and to see Christ in every person. Yet, as I ran my fingers through her sweaty hair, I felt a wave of discomfort and even a bit of judgment rising in me. I knew I shouldn\u2019t let it show, but the struggle was real\u2014between my professional duty to provide excellent service and my personal challenge to live out my faith, even in small, unseen moments like this. I hesitated, wrestling with my thoughts, unsure how to move forward without betraying either role."}
