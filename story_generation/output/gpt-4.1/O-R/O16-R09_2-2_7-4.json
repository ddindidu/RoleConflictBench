My patient, Miriam, sat across from me, her hands trembling as she described the flare-up of her autoimmune disease. The treatment she needed was clear\u2014an immunosuppressant that required careful monitoring and a strict dietary regimen to avoid complications. I explained the plan, emphasizing the importance of consistency, especially with her meals. \n\nBut as I left the clinic, hunger gnawed at me. I was traveling, far from home, and the only kosher-certified vendor was a small stand at the edge of the hospital grounds. The line was long, and I worried I\u2019d be late for my next consult. I thought about the hospital cafeteria, filled with convenient options, none of them kosher. My stomach rumbled, but my mind spun with the expectations I carried: as a doctor, to be present and focused for my patients; as a Jew, to honor the dietary laws that shaped my identity. The two roles pressed against each other, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
