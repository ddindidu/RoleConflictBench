I\u2019ve been with your company for years!\u201d My script felt useless. As a telemarketer, I was trained to stay calm, answer every objection, and never let a customer feel unheard. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t lose the sale, no matter what.\u201d But my eyes kept darting to the clock. In less than an hour, I was supposed to be at the mosque, ready to deliver the Friday sermon. As the imam, the community expected me to be present, composed, and spiritually focused. Today, though, a guest speaker was waiting in the wings, prepared to step in if I didn\u2019t arrive. My heart pounded as Mr. Rahman demanded more proof, his trust in me\u2014and the company\u2014on the line. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing down: the duty to my job, and the responsibility to my congregation. I gripped the phone tighter, caught between the demands of commerce and the call to faith, unsure which voice I should answer first."}
