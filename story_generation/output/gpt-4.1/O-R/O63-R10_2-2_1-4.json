The calls came in one after another, each prospect firing off technical questions that the script only half-answered. My manager expected me to keep the conversation moving, to handle objections smoothly, but I could hear the uncertainty in the customers\u2019 voices. I wanted to be honest, to admit when I didn\u2019t know something, but the pressure to stick to the script was intense.\n\nThen, during my break, I overheard a supervisor speaking harshly to my friend Priya, blaming her for a mistake she didn\u2019t make. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act with integrity and protect others from injustice. My heart pounded as I watched Priya\u2019s face fall. I felt torn\u2014my job demanded I stay in my lane, avoid conflict, and focus on my own performance. But my conscience screamed at me to intervene, to speak up for what was right. The weight of these conflicting expectations pressed down on me, leaving me paralyzed between my duty as an employee and my responsibility as a human being."}
