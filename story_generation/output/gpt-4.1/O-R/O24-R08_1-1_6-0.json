As a judge, I know I must stay current, not just for my own growth but to serve justice with the sharpest mind. Tonight is rare\u2014no hearings to prepare for, no urgent files to review. I could finally immerse myself in these articles, dissecting arguments, weighing their implications for my courtroom.\n\nYet, as the evening sun dips below the horizon, a familiar tug pulls at my heart. As a Muslim, I cherish these quiet moments to recite and reflect on the Quran, to reconnect with my faith and seek guidance. The expectation is not just ritual; it\u2019s nourishment for my soul, a grounding I desperately need after days of legal wrangling.\n\nI sit in my study, the journal on one side, my Quran on the other. The demands of my profession and my faith both call to me, each with its own urgency. My mind races, torn between the duty to my role as a judge and the devotion I owe to my Creator. The evening stretches before me, heavy with the weight of this choice."}
