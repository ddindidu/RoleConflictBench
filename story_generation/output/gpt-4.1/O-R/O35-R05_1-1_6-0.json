It was from the transit authority\u2014an optional sign-up for a professional development seminar. I knew I should respond soon; these seminars were important for staying sharp and showing commitment to my job. But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered that Shabbat was approaching in a few weeks, and I hadn\u2019t even started brainstorming my sermon. My congregation expected thoughtful, relevant messages, and I prided myself on never letting them down. Yet, the pressure from work was mounting, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. Should I focus on my professional growth as a subway operator, or devote this rare quiet moment to shaping words that would guide my community? My mind raced, torn between the tracks and the Torah, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both my full attention at once."}
