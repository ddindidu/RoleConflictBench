As a police officer, I was expected to enforce the law, to bring order to the neighborhood and respond to the noise complaint. I could already picture the neighbors, tired and frustrated, counting on me to restore their peace. But as I approached the door, I saw a young man sitting on the steps, his face buried in his hands, tears glistening in the porch light. He looked up at me, eyes red, and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday. My friends just wanted to make me feel less alone.\u201d \n\nIn that moment, my other role pressed on my heart\u2014the call to show love and kindness, to see the person behind the problem. I remembered the teachings of Jesus, the stories of compassion and understanding. Yet, the badge on my chest reminded me of my duty to uphold the law. The expectations of my profession and my faith pulled me in opposite directions, and I stood there, torn, wrestling with what I was supposed to do next."}
