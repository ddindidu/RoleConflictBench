New drugs, new protocols\u2014so much to keep up with. I knew my patients depended on me to be knowledgeable, to give them the best care. Just as I was reading about a promising new medication, I heard a soft sniffle from the hallway. Glancing up, I saw Mrs. Evans, a regular, standing by the counter, her shoulders shaking. She looked so small and lost. My heart ached; as a Christian, I felt the pull to comfort her, to offer a listening ear and a gentle word, just as Jesus would. But the clock was ticking, and I had only a few minutes left on my break. If I didn\u2019t finish reading, I might miss something crucial for my patients\u2019 safety. The weight of both expectations pressed on me\u2014my duty to stay informed, and my calling to show love. I sat frozen, torn between the pages in my hand and the woman who needed kindness."}
