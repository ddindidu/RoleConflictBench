She\u2019d called me in tears that morning, worried her children might get hurt if the deck wasn\u2019t fixed before the weekend. As a carpenter, I knew the urgency\u2014rotted boards could give way at any moment. My tools were ready, and I could already picture the satisfaction of restoring her family\u2019s safety.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again. It was the Martinez family, reminding me of their child\u2019s final sacrament preparation session tonight. As their priest, I was expected to guide them through this sacred milestone, to offer wisdom and reassurance. They\u2019d emphasized how much this meant to them, how they\u2019d rearranged their schedules for this last, crucial meeting.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. The deck needed my hands, the family needed my heart. I could hear the echo of Mrs. Carter\u2019s anxious voice, and the hopeful anticipation in the Martinez\u2019s message. My chest tightened as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and both were counting on me."}
