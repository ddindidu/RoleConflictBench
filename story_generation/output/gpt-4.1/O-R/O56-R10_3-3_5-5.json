Suddenly, a client stormed to the front, her voice rising above the hum of dryers. \u201cThis cut is terrible! I can\u2019t believe you call yourself a professional!\u201d she shouted, her anger echoing through the nearly empty salon. As a hairdresser, I knew I had to stay calm, listen, and do everything I could to make her happy, even if it meant staying late or redoing her hair.\n\nBut as she ranted, I noticed my manager quietly slipping a wad of cash into his pocket from the register\u2014money that wasn\u2019t his. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, to act with honesty and integrity. I felt torn between my duty to the client, who demanded my full attention, and my responsibility to confront the wrongdoing I\u2019d just witnessed. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I stood frozen, caught between the expectations of my profession and my faith."}
