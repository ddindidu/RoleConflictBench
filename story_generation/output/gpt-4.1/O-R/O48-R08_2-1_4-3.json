The hospital needed me to come in for a few hours; a patient was recovering from surgery, and they were short-staffed. I quickly changed into my scrubs, but as I looked in the mirror, I hesitated. The hospital scrubs were short-sleeved and a bit more fitted than I liked, not quite meeting the standards of modesty I tried to uphold as a Muslim woman. \n\nAt the hospital, I was expected to take and record the patient\u2019s vital signs\u2014temperature, pulse, blood pressure\u2014tasks that required efficiency and sometimes quick movement. The patient\u2019s readings were slightly elevated, so I needed to be attentive and ready to act. But as I rolled up my sleeves to check the blood pressure cuff, I felt exposed and uneasy, aware that my arms were uncovered. The pressure of being a good nursing assistant clashed with my desire to honor my faith\u2019s guidelines. I stood there, torn, the stethoscope in my hand, unsure which expectation I should meet."}
