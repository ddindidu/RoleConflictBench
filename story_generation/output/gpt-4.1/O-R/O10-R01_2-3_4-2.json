As the accountant, I knew every detail had to be perfect\u2014no room for error, no bending the rules. The company depended on me to ensure compliance, to keep us out of trouble with the authorities. My phone buzzed, and I saw a message from Maria, a member of my congregation. She was in crisis, her voice trembling as she asked if I could meet her tonight. She needed guidance, someone to help her navigate a decision that could change her life forever. As her pastor, I was expected to be present, to listen, to offer spiritual counsel and comfort. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The numbers on the screen demanded my attention, but so did Maria\u2019s pain. My heart ached with the knowledge that I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at the same time. I closed my eyes, torn between the urgent demands of my profession and the sacred trust of my calling, unsure which path to take."}
