My headset itched against my ear as I wrapped up a call, careful not to let my voice betray the fatigue I felt. The compliance system was merciless\u2014one unscheduled minute away from my desk, and I\u2019d get flagged. I needed this job, every paycheck. \n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque: a community member had arrived, eyes red and voice trembling, desperate for guidance after a sudden loss. As imam, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and counsel in moments like this. My heart ached for them, knowing how much a few words could mean right now.\n\nBut my break was still minutes away. If I left my desk, the system would log it, and I\u2019d risk disciplinary action. If I stayed, I\u2019d be failing someone who needed me most. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each unforgiving in its own way.
