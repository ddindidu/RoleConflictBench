A vendor had sent a payment confirmation, and protocol demanded I reply promptly and formally. As the accountant, I knew the importance of maintaining professional relationships and clear records. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but my eyes kept darting to the clock. In less than fifteen minutes, the main weekly service would begin at the chapel. As the priest, my presence was not just expected\u2014it was needed. The community looked to me for guidance, for comfort, for the rituals that bound us together. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, the urgency of the email clashing with the sacred call of the service. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the demands: the duty to my profession, the devotion to my faith, and the fear of letting someone down, no matter which path I chose."}
