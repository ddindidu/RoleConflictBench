My foreman\u2019s voice barked orders\u2014drop everything, head to the muster point, no exceptions. I wiped sweat from my brow, heart pounding, knowing the rules: safety first, always. But as I joined the stream of hard hats moving toward the gate, my phone buzzed in my pocket. A reminder flashed: the most sacred service of the year was about to begin. The congregation would be gathering, waiting for me to lead them in prayer, to offer words of hope and tradition. I pictured the expectant faces, the candles, the hymns echoing in the sanctuary. My boots felt heavier with every step, torn between the duty to my crew and the spiritual needs of my community. The weight of both uniforms\u2014dusty overalls and priestly robes\u2014pressed on my shoulders, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to yield. I stood at the edge of the site, the alarm still blaring, caught in the impossible pull of two worlds."}
