As an architect, I was expected to keep projects moving, to check in on timelines, to ensure every detail was accounted for. My phone buzzed with a reminder: review the progress on the new community center. I glanced at the clock. It was the hour I had set aside for spiritual study\u2014a quiet time I cherished as a nun, meant for reading scripture and silent reflection. The convent was peaceful, the kind of stillness that invited contemplation, but my mind was restless. I knew my team relied on me to keep things on track, to answer questions and solve problems. Yet, my heart longed for the calm of prayer, the gentle turning of pages, the comfort of solitude. The expectations pressed in from both sides, each demanding my full attention. I stared at the phone, then at the Bible on my table, feeling the weight of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
