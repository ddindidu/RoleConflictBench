As the lead engineer, I was responsible for ensuring every safety protocol was meticulously documented before the upcoming audit. The audit was still weeks away, but I knew from experience that last-minute updates could spell disaster. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about David\u2019s bar mitzvah, a ceremony I\u2019d promised to officiate months ago. His family had already sent out invitations, and the community expected me to be there, guiding David through this milestone. Yet, my supervisor had just asked for a preliminary review of our safety files, hinting that my presence was needed for a team meeting scheduled at the same time as the bar mitzvah. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the duty to my profession, where lives could depend on my diligence, and the sacred trust of my congregation, who looked to me for spiritual leadership. My heart pounded as I stared at my calendar, torn between two callings, each demanding my full presence."}
