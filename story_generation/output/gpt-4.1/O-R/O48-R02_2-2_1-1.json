He winced with every movement, and I could see how much he depended on me to help him dress and move safely. My hands were steady, but my mind was racing. Today is the main weekly service at church, and as the priest, everyone expects me to lead the prayers and offer comfort. I glanced at the clock\u2014service would start in less than an hour, and the congregation would already be gathering, waiting for me. But Mr. Harris needed me now; he was anxious and vulnerable, and I couldn\u2019t just rush through his care. The weight of both roles pressed on me. My heart ached with the knowledge that if I left too soon, I\u2019d be letting down a patient who trusted me. If I stayed, I\u2019d disappoint a community that looked to me for spiritual guidance. I stood there, torn, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds that needed me at the same time."}
