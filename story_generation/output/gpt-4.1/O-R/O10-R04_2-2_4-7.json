As the accountant, I knew the weight of ensuring every figure was accurate, every regulation followed. The company depended on me to keep us compliant, to avoid costly mistakes. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from Brother Ahmad, a long-time congregant. He asked if I could meet him soon, his words heavy with desperation. As the imam, I was expected to offer guidance, to be present for those in spiritual and emotional need. Ahmad\u2019s family was in crisis, and he needed me now, not later. My mind raced, torn between the pressing demands of my professional duty and the urgent call of my spiritual responsibility. The numbers on the screen seemed to mock me, while Ahmad\u2019s plea echoed in my heart. I felt the tension tighten in my chest, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
