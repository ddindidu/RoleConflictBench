The soft chime of the salon\u2019s doorbell reminded me how little time I had left before I needed to leave for the cathedral. Tonight, I was to lead the prayer vigil, a rare honor for any nun, and the sisters were counting on me to represent our convent with grace and devotion. But as I turned my client toward the mirror, her face fell. The colour was a shade warmer than she\u2019d hoped, and I could see disappointment clouding her eyes. My heart twisted. As a hairdresser, I knew I should stay, listen, and do whatever I could to make it right\u2014my reputation and her trust depended on it. Yet, the weight of my habit pressed against my skin, reminding me of my sacred duty. The vigil was about to begin, and the community expected my presence, my prayers, my leadership. I stood there, caught between the gentle hum of the salon and the distant tolling of church bells, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
