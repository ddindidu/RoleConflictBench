The dosage was complex, the margin for error razor-thin. My mind replayed the pharmacist\u2019s oath\u2014accuracy, safety, the patient\u2019s life in my hands. I could feel the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from Brother Ahmed, a gentle reminder that he hoped to talk soon about a personal crisis. As the imam, I knew how much he relied on me for guidance, how my words could offer him comfort or clarity. But the prescription in front of me demanded my full attention; a single distraction could be catastrophic. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the urge to step away and call Ahmed, to be the spiritual anchor he needed, while knowing that even a moment\u2019s lapse here could endanger a life. The expectations of both roles pulled at me, each urgent, each vital, and I stood frozen, torn between the needs of my patient and my community."}
