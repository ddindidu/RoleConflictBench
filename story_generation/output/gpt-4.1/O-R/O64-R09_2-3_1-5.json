My manager expects me to keep the line moving, double-check prices, and never make a mistake. My stomach rumbles; I haven\u2019t eaten since morning, and the communal lunch for staff is about to start. I glance at the trays being set out\u2014chicken, pasta, salads\u2014but none of the dishes have kosher certification. I know everyone expects me to join in, to eat and chat during our only break, but I can\u2019t ignore my commitment to keeping kosher. I could try to explain, but I worry about drawing attention or seeming ungrateful. The register beeps, another customer hands me cash, and I feel the pressure mounting from both sides\u2014my duty to my job, and my responsibility to my faith. My hands tremble as I give change, my mind racing with what I should do next."}
