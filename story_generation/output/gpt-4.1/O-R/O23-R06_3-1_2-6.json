My client was counting on me to catch any hidden pitfalls\u2014one missed clause could mean disaster. The pressure was immense; I knew I had to review every word tonight. But as I reached for my pen, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a colleague, asking if I could spare a few minutes to talk. She\u2019d been having a rough week, and I\u2019d noticed her eyes were red from crying earlier. As a Christian, I felt a deep pull to offer kindness, to listen and comfort her, just as Jesus would. Yet, the clock was ticking, and my client\u2019s future was in my hands.

The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I found myself frozen, unable to choose which role to honor first."}
