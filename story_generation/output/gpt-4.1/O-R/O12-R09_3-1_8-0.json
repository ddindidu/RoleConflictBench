The production outage was traced back to a bug in my code, and now hundreds of customers couldn\u2019t access the service. My manager\u2019s Slack message was clear: \u201cWe need you on this, now.\u201d I knew the expectation\u2014jump in, troubleshoot, fix it fast. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized it was almost time for my weekly study session with my kids. Every week, I set aside this hour to teach them about our Jewish traditions, to share stories and values that my parents once shared with me. They looked forward to it, and so did I. I could reschedule, but I knew how much it meant to them, and to me, to keep this time sacred. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the quiet, steady pull of my role as a Jewish parent and teacher. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, each one important, each one asking for all of me."}
