As a delivery person, I knew customers expected quick, polite responses, so when a customer texted, \u201cWhere\u2019s my package?\u201d I pulled over and typed a courteous reply, assuring them I was on my way. Just then, my other phone vibrated\u2014a message from a community member at the mosque. \u201cImam, I\u2019d love to talk when you have a moment. I need some advice,\u201d it read. I felt a familiar tug inside me. As an imam, I was expected to be available, to listen and offer guidance, especially when someone reached out for help. But right now, I was in my delivery uniform, with a van full of packages and a schedule to keep. My mind raced, torn between the customer waiting for their order and the community member seeking spiritual support. Both needed me, both expected me to be present and attentive. I stared at my phones, feeling the weight of their expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which role to answer first."}
