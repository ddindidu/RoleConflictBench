My client was counting on me to catch any hidden pitfalls\u2014one missed clause could mean disaster. The clock ticked louder with every passing minute, reminding me that the High Holiday service was only hours away. As the rabbi, I was expected to deliver a sermon that would inspire and guide my congregation, many of whom only came to synagogue on these sacred days. My notes for the sermon were scattered, my thoughts divided. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the lawyer who must protect his client, the rabbi who must shepherd his flock. My phone buzzed with a reminder from the synagogue board, while my client\u2019s email subject line flashed urgent. My heart pounded as I stared at the contract, then at the blank page where my sermon should be. I knew I couldn\u2019t give less than my best to either, but time was running out, and I was being pulled in two directions at once."}
