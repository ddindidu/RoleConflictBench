The intercom crackled, and a passenger\u2019s voice came through, asking for directions to a transfer line. I knew I had to answer promptly and clearly\u2014passenger safety and assistance were my responsibility. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a message from the mosque committee: the special remembrance gathering had begun, and the congregation was waiting for me to lead the prayer. No one else was authorized, and the crowd was larger than usual, their expectations heavy with reverence. My hands tightened on the controls. I could hear the faint hum of voices from the train car, and in my mind, the echo of the waiting congregation. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one demanding my presence for spiritual guidance, the other for the safety and service of those in my care. My heart pounded as I weighed the needs of my passengers against the hopes of my community, caught in the impossible space between duty and devotion."}
