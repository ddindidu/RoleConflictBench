My break was scheduled in five minutes, but the queue was still full\u2014management had sent another reminder about not leaving our stations unless absolutely necessary. I felt the pressure mounting, knowing every second away from my desk would be scrutinized. Just then, a message popped up on my phone: my friend, also a telemarketer here, was being unfairly blamed for a drop in sales. I could see the injustice, and as a Hindu, I believed in standing up for what was right, in practicing dharma and compassion. My heart pounded. Should I step away to support my friend, risking management\u2019s disapproval and possibly my job? Or should I stay, following the rules, but betraying my own sense of justice and morality? The expectations of my job and my faith pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat frozen, torn between duty and conscience."}
