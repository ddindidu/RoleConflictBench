The filing deadline was tomorrow, and my client was counting on me to catch any loopholes or hidden risks. My phone buzzed with a reminder: Maghrib prayer was in twenty minutes. As the imam, I was expected to lead, to be present for the congregation, even if tonight it was only a handful of worshippers. I knew Brother Ahmed could step in\u2014he was qualified, and the group was small\u2014but I also knew the community valued my presence, my guidance. My mind raced between the contract\u2019s clauses and the mosque\u2019s quiet expectation. If I stayed, I might miss something crucial in the agreement. If I left, I\u2019d be letting down those who looked to me for spiritual leadership. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my time, my focus, my heart. I stared at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, torn between duty to my client and devotion to my congregation, unsure which path to take."}
