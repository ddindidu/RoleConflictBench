My train leaves in twenty minutes,\u201d he pleaded, eyes darting between me and the traffic ahead. As a taxi driver, I felt the pressure to get him to the station on time, to be the reliable link in his journey.

I pictured the expectant faces of the kids, the trust their parents placed in me as their priest. My mind raced\u2014if I took the fastest route, I might make it back just in time, but any delay could mean letting down the children and their families.
