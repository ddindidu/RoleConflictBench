As a nursing assistant, I knew my presence mattered\u2014she needed comfort, someone to listen, someone to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. I wanted to stay, to offer her every ounce of support I could muster.\n\nBut in the back of my mind, the weight of my other calling pressed in. As a rabbi, I was expected to begin preparing my next Shabbat sermon. The congregation relied on me for guidance, for words that would inspire and uplift. The calendar on my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cBrainstorm sermon topics.\u201d I felt the familiar tug-of-war inside me\u2014my heart anchored to Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s bedside, my mind drifting to the sanctuary and the faces waiting for wisdom.\n\nI tried to focus on her, but my thoughts kept slipping away, guilt gnawing at me. How could I be fully present for her when I knew I was letting down my congregation by not preparing? The expectations from both worlds pressed in, and I sat there, torn, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
