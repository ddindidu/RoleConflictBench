The bar mitzvah is set to begin in less than an hour, and my phone vibrates with a message from the synagogue: \u201cWhere are you, Rabbi? The family is getting anxious.\u201d My heart pounds. I know how much this day means to them\u2014months of preparation, a young boy\u2019s rite of passage, a community gathered in anticipation. But just then, a pilot\u2019s voice crackles through my headset, requesting the altimeter setting. It\u2019s routine, but my mind is split. I\u2019m expected to be fully present here, guiding aircraft safely, every instruction precise and timely. Yet, I\u2019m also expected to stand before a congregation, to lead, to bless, to celebrate. The weight of both worlds presses on me, and I feel the tension rising\u2014torn between the sky and the sanctuary, between duty and devotion."}
