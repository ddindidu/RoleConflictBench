As a judge, I know the weight of tomorrow\u2019s trial\u2014every detail must be scrutinized, every argument considered. The law expects nothing less than my unwavering focus and impartiality. Yet, as I pore over the files, my phone vibrates. It\u2019s a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. Her words are brief but heavy: \u201cCan we talk? I\u2019m struggling.\u201d As her pastor, I am called to offer comfort, to listen, to be present in her pain. I glance at the clock, feeling the hours slip away.
