My next passenger slides in, mentioning their meeting isn\u2019t for another hour, and asks to take the scenic route. I nod, but my mind is elsewhere. Tonight is the weekly Buddhist study circle, and I haven\u2019t read the chapter we\u2019re discussing. I promised myself I\u2019d arrive early, find a quiet corner, and catch up before the others arrive. As a taxi driver, I know I should give my passenger a relaxed, pleasant ride, maybe even chat if they\u2019re in the mood. But as a Buddhist, I feel the weight of my commitment to the sangha and my own spiritual growth. The minutes tick by, each one a reminder that I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My hands grip the wheel a little tighter, torn between the duty to my passenger and the promise I made to myself and my community."}
