Two minutes until the safety briefing\u2014mandatory, no exceptions. The foreman had already given me a look, the kind that said, \u201cDon\u2019t be late again.\u201d I knew the team counted on me to pull my weight, to be present and focused. But as I started toward the gathering point, a few of the guys from the crew, who knew I was a pastor, stopped me. They\u2019d been talking about the rough week one of them was having, and someone asked if I had a story or some words to share. I felt the familiar tug\u2014my calling to offer comfort, to teach, to remind them of hope. But the clock was ticking, and if I missed the briefing, I\u2019d be letting the team down, maybe even risking my job. My heart pounded as I stood between the two groups, the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to both at once."}
