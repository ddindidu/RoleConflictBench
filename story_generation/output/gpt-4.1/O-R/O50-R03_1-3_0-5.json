The factory floor was quiet\u2014production slow, but the supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need this fixed before the next rush.\u201d My hands, skilled and steady, moved over wires and circuits, but my heart was elsewhere. The convent\u2019s bell would soon toll for evening prayers, and tonight was not just any night. I had been chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the city cathedral, a rare honor and a heavy responsibility. The sisters expected me to be a beacon of calm and devotion, to guide them and the gathered faithful in solemn worship. Yet here I was, torn between the hum of machinery and the hush of prayer, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My tools felt heavy, my habit tighter than usual, as if both roles demanded more than I could give. I glanced at the clock, pulse racing, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
