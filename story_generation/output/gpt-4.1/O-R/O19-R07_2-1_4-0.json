My shift was nearly over, but a patient approached the counter, prescription in hand, eyes anxious. She was starting a new medication, and I knew she needed careful counseling\u2014side effects, interactions, the importance of adherence. As a pharmacist, I couldn\u2019t rush this; my duty was to ensure her safety and understanding. Yet, tonight was the temple\u2019s evening chant, a ritual I rarely missed. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be present, to join the community in recitation and reflection, to nurture my own spiritual practice. The minutes slipped by as I explained the medication, but my mind flickered between the patient\u2019s questions and the image of saffron robes and candlelight. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my presence, each holding a piece of who I am. My heart pounded with the strain of choosing, knowing that whatever I decided, I would be letting someone\u2014or myself\u2014down."}
