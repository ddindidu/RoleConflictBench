My phone buzzed with a message from the contractor, asking me to approve a change in materials\u2014cheaper, but not up to code. Later, I overheard him boasting about pocketing the difference. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma, to act with honesty and protect others from harm. The thought of employees working in a building that might not be safe gnawed at me. Yet, as the lead architect, I was under pressure to keep costs down and meet the client\u2019s tight deadline. If I reported the wrongdoing, the project could stall, and my reputation might suffer. But if I stayed silent, I would be complicit in something deeply wrong. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give. I stared at the plans, torn between my duty to my profession and my duty to my conscience, unable to move forward."}
