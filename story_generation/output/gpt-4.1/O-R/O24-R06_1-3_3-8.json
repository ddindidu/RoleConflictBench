As a judge, I was expected to draft a clear and detailed scheduling order for a new case by the end of the week. The law required precision, impartiality, and a certain detachment. Yet, as I reviewed the case file, I saw the names of the parties\u2014one of whom I knew from church, a woman who had recently lost her job and was struggling to care for her children. My heart ached for her. My faith as a Christian called me to show love and kindness, to see her not just as a name in a legal dispute but as a person in need of compassion. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: the judge who must be fair and thorough, and the Christian who must be loving and merciful. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the demands of justice and the call to show grace, unsure how to reconcile the two as the deadline loomed."}
