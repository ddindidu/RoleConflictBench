My mind wandered, but I kept my focus\u2014accuracy was everything in this job. As I handed a receipt to a customer, I noticed my friend, Priya, at the end of the line, her face tense. When she reached me, I saw the assistant manager, Mr. Patel, hovering nearby, his tone sharp as he accused her of shoplifting. I knew Priya would never do such a thing. My heart pounded. As a cashier, I was expected to process transactions and follow store policy, not get involved. But as a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act with compassion and justice. The expectation to remain neutral at work clashed with my moral duty to defend my friend. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, my hands trembling as I tried to steady the scanner, torn between my responsibilities as an employee and my conscience as a Hindu."}
