The call volume is unusually light today, and my supervisor has just sent a message: \u201cFeel free to take your break whenever you need.\u201d Relief washes over me, but it\u2019s short-lived. My phone buzzes with a reminder from the convent\u2014tonight, I\u2019m to lead the prayer vigil at the cathedral, representing our entire community. The sisters expect me to be present, composed, and spiritually prepared. I know I should use this lull at work to pray and center myself, but the company expects me to stay logged in, ready to jump on any incoming call. My headset feels heavier than usual, a physical reminder of my obligation to be available for customers. Yet my heart aches with the knowledge that my sisters are counting on me to guide them in prayer, to be a beacon of faith. I sit at my desk, torn between the quiet hum of the call center and the sacred silence of the chapel, unsure which duty I should honor first."}
