Swim lessons would start in less than an hour, and if the rope broke mid-class, it could be dangerous and chaotic. As the lifeguard, it was my responsibility to make sure everything was safe and in order, and I knew fixing the rope would take time\u2014maybe more than I had before my next commitment.\n\nThat commitment was my weekly study session with the kids at the synagogue. I\u2019d promised their parents I\u2019d teach them about Shabbat and the meaning behind our traditions. The kids looked forward to it, and I felt a deep responsibility to pass on our values and history. The lesson could technically be moved to another day, but I knew how much consistency mattered, especially for the younger ones.\n\nStanding by the pool, I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me. The pool needed me now, but so did the children. I could hear the echo of my own promises in both places, and I stood there, torn, trying to figure out which responsibility I would have to let down."}
