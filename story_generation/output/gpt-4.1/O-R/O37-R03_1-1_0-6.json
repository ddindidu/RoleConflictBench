My heart longs for the peace of spiritual reading, the gentle turning of pages, and the silent conversation with God that I so rarely find time for. Yet, as I settle into my small chair, I notice dust gathering on the windowsill and crumbs scattered on the common room table. The sisters have been busy, and the shared spaces are beginning to show it. As the housekeeping cleaner, I know I\u2019m expected to keep everything spotless, to make sure the house is always welcoming and clean. But as a nun, I am also called to nurture my soul, to seek stillness and reflection. The mop and the Bible both seem to call my name, each with its own urgency. My hands hover between the cleaning cloth and the worn cover of my prayer book, my mind torn by the weight of these expectations. I close my eyes, feeling the tension coil inside me, unsure which duty should come first."}
