As the lead engineer, I was expected to ensure every safety standard was met, and now, with the threat of a shutdown looming, the pressure from management was palpable. They wanted a quick fix, a workaround\u2014something to keep the project moving. But as I reviewed the findings, I overheard a heated conversation outside my office. My friend, Rajesh, was being blamed for the oversight, though I knew he had followed protocol. The blame was unfair, and my heart ached with the weight of my dharma, my Hindu values urging me to stand up for truth and justice. Yet, if I spoke up, I risked drawing attention to deeper issues that could halt operations and jeopardize my own position. The expectations of my profession clashed with my moral compass, and I felt torn, caught between the demands of my role as an engineer and my duty as a Hindu to uphold what is right. My mind raced, wrestling with the consequences of every possible action, as the voices outside grew louder."}
