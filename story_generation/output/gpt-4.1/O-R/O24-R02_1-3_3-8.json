As a judge, I was expected to draft a clear and detailed scheduling order for a new case, and the deadline loomed at the end of the week. The legal language needed to be precise, the timeline fair, and I knew the attorneys would scrutinize every word. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from the parish office: a family needed me to lead a final, mandatory preparation session for their child\u2019s sacrament\u2014an event that could not be postponed, as the ceremony was imminent. As a priest, I was expected to guide and support them, to ensure their child was ready for this sacred milestone. My mind raced between the demands of the law and the needs of my congregation. I felt the weight of both robes\u2014one black, one white\u2014pressing on my shoulders, each pulling me in a different direction. I stared at the blinking cursor, torn, knowing I could not give both roles the full attention they deserved."}
