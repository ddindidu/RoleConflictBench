My advisor would be pleased if I took the initiative, and I felt the familiar tug of scientific curiosity, the urge to see if my hypothesis would hold up under scrutiny. But just as I was about to confirm the booking, my phone buzzed with a message from Tenzin, my friend from the sangha. He wanted to meet tomorrow to discuss the sermon we\u2019d heard last week, about non-attachment and mindful living. He\u2019d been struggling, and I knew how much these conversations meant to him\u2014and to me, as part of my own spiritual practice. I felt the tension coil in my chest: the expectation to push forward in my research, to be the diligent scientist, versus the call to be present, compassionate, and engaged in my Buddhist path. Both roles mattered deeply, but in this moment, they seemed to pull me in opposite directions. I sat in silence, torn, the weight of both worlds pressing in as I tried to decide which path to follow."}
