Dispatch had called me for a patient with a sprained ankle\u2014urgent, but not life or death. My training as an ambulance driver echoed in my mind: safety first, no matter the pressure. But my phone buzzed on the dashboard, a message from the parish secretary. The Martinez family was waiting at the church, their child\u2019s sacrament only days away, and this was the last chance for the required preparation session. As their priest, I\u2019d promised to guide them, to be present, to honor the sacred trust they\u2019d placed in me. My heart pounded with the weight of both uniforms\u2014the city\u2019s expectation that I deliver help swiftly and safely, and the church\u2019s need for my spiritual leadership. I stared at the red light, torn between the blaring urgency of the siren and the silent, sacred call of my faith."}
