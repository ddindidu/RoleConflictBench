My shift was almost over, and I was already thinking about the special healing service at the convent tonight. Sister Maria was ill, and the community was gathering for prayers\u2014something I felt deeply called to attend. Just then, a woman approached, her eyes anxious, clutching a sweater. \u201cI need to return this,\u201d she said, but when I asked for her receipt, she shook her head. Store policy was clear: no returns without proof of purchase. My manager expected strict adherence, and I knew bending the rules could cost me my job. Yet, as a nun, compassion and mercy were at the heart of my calling. The woman\u2019s voice trembled as she explained her situation, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. The clock ticked closer to the service, my heart torn between duty to my employer and the spiritual needs of my community, between the rules I was paid to uphold and the compassion I was called to embody."}
