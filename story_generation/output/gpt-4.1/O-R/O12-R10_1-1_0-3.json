The module worked, but it was messy\u2014full of shortcuts I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d clean up later. With the deadline still weeks away, I could easily refactor it tomorrow. My manager wouldn\u2019t notice, and the team was used to quick fixes. But as I glanced up, I saw a colleague quietly slip ahead of another in the lunch queue, pretending not to notice. It was a small thing, but it gnawed at me. As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma\u2014right conduct\u2014even in small matters. Should I speak up about the queue, or focus on my code and trust I\u2019d fix it later? The expectation to write clean, honest code tugged at me, but so did the urge to address the minor injustice I\u2019d just witnessed. My mind spun, caught between the demands of my profession and the quiet voice of my conscience, unsure which role deserved my attention first."}
