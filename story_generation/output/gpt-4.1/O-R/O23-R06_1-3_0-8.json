As a lawyer, I knew I should review every clause, analyze the risks, and ensure my client\u2019s interests were protected\u2014even if the deadline was weeks away. It was my job to be thorough, to anticipate problems before they arose. But just as I began to read, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a friend: her father was in the hospital, and she was overwhelmed, asking if I could come sit with her for a while. \n\nAs a Christian, I felt the call to show love and compassion, to be present for someone in need, just as Jesus taught. But the contract nagged at me\u2014what if I missed something important by putting it off? My client trusted me to be diligent. Yet my faith told me that people mattered more than paperwork. I stared at the screen, torn between my professional duty and the pull of my heart, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
