As a judge, I was expected to review every detail of the emergency motion for a temporary restraining order that had just landed on my desk. The law demanded my full attention, and the parties involved needed a swift, fair decision\u2014within the hour. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the conversion candidate\u2019s final study session was about to begin. As their rabbi, I was the one who had guided them through months of learning, and this last session before their Beit Din was crucial. They were anxious, relying on me to clarify their final questions and offer reassurance. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. The law demanded urgency and precision; my community expected compassion and presence. I stared at the case file, then at my Torah notes, my mind pulled in two directions, heart pounding as I tried to decide which responsibility to honor first."}
