The calls blurred together, but today, more prospects than usual pressed me for technical details the script barely covered. My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cStick to the script, don\u2019t improvise.\u201d But I could hear the confusion and frustration in the customers\u2019 voices. I wanted to help, to be honest, but I was expected to redirect or gloss over what I didn\u2019t know.\n\nAs I waited for the next call, I saw a coworker slip ahead in the queue for the best leads\u2014a small act, but it felt wrong. My upbringing as a Hindu taught me to value honesty, fairness, and dharma. I felt a tug inside, a responsibility to speak up or at least not ignore it. But I also knew that rocking the boat could make my already stressful job harder. The pressure to meet quotas, to keep my job, to follow the rules\u2014these clashed with my sense of what was right.
