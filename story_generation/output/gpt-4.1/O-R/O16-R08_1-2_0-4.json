Everything points to a common cold, and I know my responsibility as a doctor is to diagnose her accurately and reassure her. My white coat feels heavier today, though, because I\u2019m also thinking about the office function scheduled this afternoon. It\u2019s a mixed-gender event, and my colleagues often dress up for these occasions. As a Muslim, I\u2019m expected to dress modestly, covering my arms and legs, and I always try to honor that. But I know some of my coworkers might see my long sleeves and headscarf as out of place or even unfriendly at social gatherings. I feel the pressure to fit in, to be approachable and part of the team, but I also feel the weight of my faith and the comfort it brings me. As I write the prescription, my mind is torn between the expectations of my profession and my beliefs, wondering how I can be true to both in a world that sometimes asks me to choose."}
