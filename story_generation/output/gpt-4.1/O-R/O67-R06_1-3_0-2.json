As I pulled out, dispatch added, \u201cSuspect at the scene, police en route.\u201d The address hit me like a blow. It was the home of a man recently released after serving time for a violent crime\u2014one that had deeply hurt someone in my church community. \n\nAs I sped through the city, siren wailing, my mind raced.
