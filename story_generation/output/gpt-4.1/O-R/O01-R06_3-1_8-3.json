The project was behind schedule, and the client\u2019s frustration echoed in every email. As the lead architect, I was expected to resolve every issue, keep the teams motivated, and deliver on time\u2014no excuses. Yet, as the clock ticked closer to ten, my thoughts drifted to the church down the street, where the congregation would soon gather for worship. I could almost hear the hymns, feel the warmth of community, and remember my promise to myself to be present, not just in faith but in fellowship. My pastor had gently reminded me last week that faith thrives in community, not isolation. But the demands of this project pressed in, urgent and unyielding. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the unfinished plans on my desk and the pews waiting for me. I stared at my phone, torn between answering another urgent call and silencing it to slip away for worship, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me."}
