My shift as a telemarketer is usually straightforward\u2014most callers are polite, and the script covers nearly every question. Today, though, my mind drifts to the lesson I promised my kids tonight. We\u2019re supposed to talk about the story of Ruth, about kindness and loyalty, values I want them to carry. My supervisor pings me: \u201cCan you stay late? We\u2019re short-staffed.\u201d I glance at the clock. If I agree, I\u2019ll miss our study slot. I could reschedule, but I know how much the kids look forward to our time together, how important it is to pass on our traditions. At the same time, I feel the pressure to be a team player at work, to handle every call with patience and professionalism. My stomach knots as I weigh the expectations\u2014be the reliable employee, be the devoted parent and teacher. The phone rings again, and I\u2019m caught between two worlds, unsure which one I\u2019ll have to let down."}
