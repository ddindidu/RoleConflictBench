As an accountant, I was expected to remain professional, clear, and impartial, focusing only on the numbers and the facts. But as I scrolled through the records, I noticed something unsettling\u2014a vendor had overcharged us, and my friend, who worked for that vendor, was being blamed for the error. I knew my friend was honest and had nothing to do with the mistake, but the client was growing impatient, demanding answers. My Hindu values urged me to stand up for what was right, to protect my friend from unjust accusations, and to act with integrity. Yet, my role as an accountant required me to communicate only the official findings, not to get personally involved. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations of my profession against my moral duty, feeling the tension build inside me as I prepared to respond."}
