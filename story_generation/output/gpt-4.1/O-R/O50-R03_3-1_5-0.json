I knew the sound well\u2014if I didn\u2019t act now, the whole line could grind to a halt, costing hours of work and risking my reputation as the most reliable repairer in the plant. My tool bag was already slung over my shoulder, but as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. The food drive at the convent was about to begin. Sister Agnes had reminded me just this morning: \u201cWe need every hand, especially yours. The shelter is counting on us.\u201d I could picture the tables being set, the line of hungry faces waiting for a warm meal, and my sisters looking for me among them. My mind raced, torn between the urgent call of the machine and the quiet, persistent pull of my vows. Both worlds needed me, both expected my full devotion, and in this moment, I felt split in two, paralyzed by the weight of choosing who I would let down."}
