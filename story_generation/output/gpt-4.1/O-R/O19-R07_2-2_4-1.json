Mrs. Chan stood before me, clutching her new prescription, her brow furrowed with worry. As a pharmacist, I knew my duty: to guide her patiently, to explain every detail about her medication, its side effects, and how to take it safely. She needed reassurance, and I could see the anxiety in her eyes. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014the community memorial service at the temple was tonight. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be present, to chant and support the grieving families, to honor the departed with my community. The temple elders had asked me to help lead the ceremony, and my absence would be noticed. I felt the pull of both worlds, the quiet call of compassion in the pharmacy and the solemn duty at the temple. My heart pounded as I weighed the needs of the patient before me against the expectations of my spiritual community, torn between two paths, each demanding my presence, each rooted in care."}
