My shift had started before dawn, and I hadn\u2019t had time for my full morning puja. Instead, I whispered the Gayatri mantra under my breath, hoping it would bring me some peace. Suddenly, a passenger reported an unattended bag in car three. My training as a subway operator kicked in\u2014passenger safety was my top priority. I was supposed to stay focused, ready to make announcements, call security, and possibly evacuate the train. But as I reached for the intercom, I felt a pang of guilt. My mind was split: part of me wanted to pause, close my eyes, and finish my mantra for protection and clarity; the other part knew every second counted in a potential emergency. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my duty to the hundreds of people in my care, and my duty to my faith, which asked for calm and devotion even in chaos. My heart pounded as I hesitated, caught between the demands of the world outside and the world within."}
