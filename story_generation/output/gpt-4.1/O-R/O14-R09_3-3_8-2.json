I rush over, scanning the warning: possible hazardous leakage. My mind races through safety protocols\u2014containment, evacuation, documentation. I know every second counts. But my phone vibrates with a message from my spouse: \u201cHe\u2019s struggling with the Torah portion again. Can you help before dinner?\u201d My son\u2019s bar mitzvah is only weeks away, and he\u2019s anxious, his confidence fragile. I promised to guide him, to pass on the melodies and meanings my father taught me. Yet here I am, torn between the sterile urgency of the lab and the warmth of our living room, where tradition waits. The weight of responsibility presses on both sides\u2014colleagues counting on my vigilance, my family counting on my presence. I stand frozen, heart pounding, caught between the hiss of potential danger and the quiet call of heritage, unsure which world needs me more in this moment."}
