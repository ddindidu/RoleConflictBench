My manager\u2019s eyes flick to me, reminding me to keep things moving, but the woman in front of me is furious about a coupon that won\u2019t scan. I force a smile, apologizing, trying to soothe her, even as my heart pounds. I know the mosque is filling up just across the street. Today is the special remembrance, and I am the only imam available to lead the prayer. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014another message from the mosque committee, asking where I am. The cashier in me wants to stay, to help my coworkers and not let the line grow longer. The imam in me feels the weight of the congregation\u2019s expectation, the sacred trust to guide them in prayer. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the pressure from both sides is suffocating. My hands tremble as I hand the woman her receipt, my mind torn between the demands of the register and the call to prayer echoing in my soul."}
