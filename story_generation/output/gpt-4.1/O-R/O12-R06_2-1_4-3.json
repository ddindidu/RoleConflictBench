My phone buzzed with another Slack message from the product team, asking for my input on the new feature. The deadline was looming, and I knew the other teams were waiting on me to move forward. My mind raced with technical details, diagrams, and the pressure to deliver something solid and innovative. At the same time, I glanced at the clock\u2014Sunday morning. The church service would start soon. I remembered the warmth of worship, the sense of belonging, and the expectation from my church community to be present, to serve, to connect. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I stayed home to work, I\u2019d let down my church family and miss the spiritual renewal I craved. If I went to church, I\u2019d risk delaying the project and disappointing my colleagues. My heart tugged in both directions, torn between my commitment to my faith and my responsibility as a developer. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me."}
