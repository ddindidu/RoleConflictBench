The radio played softly as I kept my eyes on the speedometer, careful to obey every traffic law. My job demanded it\u2014one ticket, and I could lose my license, my livelihood. As I waited at a red light, I saw a man in a suit step out of a black car and hand an envelope to a police officer. The officer glanced around, then quickly tucked it into his pocket. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up against adharma, to act when I saw injustice. But as a taxi driver, I was expected to mind my own business, keep to my route, and avoid trouble. If I intervened or reported what I saw, I risked drawing attention, maybe even retaliation. Yet if I stayed silent, I would be betraying my conscience and the values I hold dear. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between my duty to the law of the road and the higher law of dharma, unsure which path to take."}
