As a software developer, I know these sessions are where ideas spark and cross-team collaboration happens. Product expects us to show up, contribute, and help shape the next big feature. I want to be there, to be seen as a team player, to have my voice heard. But I\u2019m also traveling for work, and lunchtime will hit right in the middle of the session. Here, in this unfamiliar city, kosher options are scarce. There\u2019s only one small vendor nearby that I know is kosher-certified, and their hours are limited. If I miss their window, I\u2019ll have nothing to eat until much later. The thought of skipping the session tugs at my sense of responsibility to my team, but the idea of compromising my dietary observance feels just as wrong. I feel the tension coil in my chest, torn between my commitment to my work and my commitment to my faith, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left behind."}
