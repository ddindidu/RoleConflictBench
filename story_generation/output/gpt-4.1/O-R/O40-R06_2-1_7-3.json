The damage was worse than I\u2019d expected, and the family was counting on me to fix it before their daughter\u2019s birthday party next week. I could already hear the urgency in their voices, the hope that I\u2019d restore their gathering place in time. I measured, planned, and realized the only way to finish was to work through the weekend\u2014especially Sunday.\n\nBut Sunday was the one day I tried to set aside for church. My faith taught me to honor the Sabbath, to gather with others, to worship and find rest. I\u2019d missed a few services lately, always telling myself I\u2019d go when time allowed. Now, as I ran my hand over the rough wood, I felt the weight of both roles pressing down. The family\u2019s need for my skills, my promise to them, and my own longing for spiritual renewal all tangled together. I stood there, torn, wondering which expectation I would have to let down."}
