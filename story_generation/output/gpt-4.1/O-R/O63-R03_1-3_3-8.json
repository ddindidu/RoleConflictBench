Each call I make brings me closer to smashing this week\u2019s quota, and I can almost hear the praise in tomorrow\u2019s team meeting. But as I hang up, the bell for evening prayer echoes down the hall. I remember Mother Superior\u2019s gentle request\u2014she wants me to lead daily reflections for the retreat, a sacred responsibility. My heart aches with the weight of both worlds: the relentless drive to sell, to meet targets, to prove my worth in the office, and the quiet, holy call to guide my sisters in faith. I know the community expects me to be present, thoughtful, and spiritually prepared, but the ringing phone and the promise of another sale tug at me. I close my eyes, torn between the demands of my headset and my habit, wondering how I can possibly honor both."}
