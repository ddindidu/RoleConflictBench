The wail of the siren barely cut through the roar of the thunderstorm. The patient in the back was fading fast, and every second counted. I knew the roads were slick, visibility almost nothing, but I had to get to the hospital\u2014fast, but safe. My training screamed at me: don\u2019t risk more lives by driving recklessly. Yet, in the back of my mind, another worry gnawed at me. Tonight was the midweek church service, and I hadn\u2019t missed a single one in years. My pastor always said our presence was a testament to our faith, and the community counted on me to help set up, to pray, to be there. I could almost hear the disappointment if I didn\u2019t show up, the subtle questions about my commitment. My heart pounded with the weight of both responsibilities\u2014one to the patient\u2019s life, the other to my faith and community. The storm outside was nothing compared to the turmoil inside me as I wrestled with what to do next."}
