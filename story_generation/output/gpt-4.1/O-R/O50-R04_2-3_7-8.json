The whir of wasted material grated on my nerves. I was expected to guide him, to patiently explain\u2014again\u2014how to avoid these costly mistakes. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cYou\u2019re the expert. They rely on you.\u201d I took a breath, ready to step in, when my phone buzzed. It was a message from the mosque: someone had arrived, desperate for spiritual counsel after a devastating loss. As imam, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort and wisdom in moments of crisis. My heart ached for the grieving soul waiting for me, but the operator\u2019s anxious glance pulled me back. Both needed me\u2014one for technical guidance, the other for spiritual solace. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my full attention, each expecting me to be the answer. I stood frozen, caught between the clatter of machines and the silent plea for comfort, unsure which path to take first."}
