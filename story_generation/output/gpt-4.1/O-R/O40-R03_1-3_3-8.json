The client wants custom cabinets by the end of the month, and I need to estimate the wood, hinges, and varnish before the supplier closes for the weekend. My hands itch to measure and sketch, to lose myself in the familiar rhythm of carpentry. But as I reach for my notebook, Sister Agnes appears in the doorway, reminding me that Mother Superior expects me to lead the daily reflections for the retreat. The sisters are counting on me for spiritual guidance, to prepare thoughtful meditations that will nourish their souls. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding precision and planning, the other contemplation and presence. My mind races with scripture and supply lists, prayers and purchase orders, as I struggle to reconcile the calluses on my hands with the quiet expected in the chapel. I close my eyes, torn between the hum of the saw and the hush of prayer, knowing I must choose where to turn first."}
