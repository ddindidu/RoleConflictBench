My client expected me to keep track of supplies and let them know when something was running low, but I\u2019d forgotten to mention it last time. The next cleaning was in just a few days, and I worried there wouldn\u2019t be enough left. As I debated whether to quietly use water instead, I saw another cleaner slip ahead of me in the supply room line, grabbing the last bottle of the brand we always used. My Hindu upbringing tugged at me\u2014honesty, fairness, and doing the right thing were values I\u2019d grown up with. Should I speak up about the line-cutting, or let it go to avoid conflict? Should I tell my client about the shortage, risking their disappointment, or try to make do? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I stood there, torn, unsure which expectation to honor first."}
