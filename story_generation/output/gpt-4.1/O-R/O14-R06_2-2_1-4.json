The experiment I\u2019d been planning for weeks depended on this window; missing it would set my research back by months. As a scientist, I knew how crucial it was to seize this opportunity, to gather the data that could finally answer the questions I\u2019d been chasing. But as I checked the date, my heart sank\u2014it was Sunday morning, the same time as church service. My pastor had just spoken about the importance of regular worship and community, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be more present, not just physically but spiritually. I could already imagine the empty seat in the pew, the texts from friends asking if everything was okay. I felt torn, the weight of my commitment to science pressing against the quiet, persistent call of my faith. I sat at my desk, hands trembling, caught between two worlds that both asked for all of me, unsure which part of myself I could bear to disappoint."}
