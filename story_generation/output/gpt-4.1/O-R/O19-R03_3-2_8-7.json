As a pharmacist, I knew how crucial it was to stay updated\u2014my patients depended on my knowledge, and my license required it. The online seminar was starting in ten minutes, and I still hadn\u2019t finished the pre-reading. \n\nJust then, Sister Agnes knocked gently. \u201cSister Maria, Mrs. Delaney is here. She\u2019s troubled and needs your guidance.\u201d As a nun, I was expected to be present for those in spiritual need, to listen and offer comfort. Mrs. Delaney\u2019s faith was wavering, and she\u2019d specifically asked for me. \n\nI felt the weight of both callings pressing down. My heart ached for Mrs. Delaney, but my mind raced with the fear of falling behind professionally. The clock ticked louder, and I stared at the door, torn between the world of medicine and the world of faith, knowing I could not give my full self to both at this moment."}
