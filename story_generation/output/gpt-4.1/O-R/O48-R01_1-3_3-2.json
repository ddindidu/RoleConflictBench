The routine was comforting\u2014temperature, pulse, blood pressure, all neatly recorded. As a nursing assistant, I knew how important it was to keep everything on schedule. But just as I reached her door, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mark, a member of my congregation. He was in the chapel, desperate, his text trembling with urgency. He needed spiritual guidance\u2014now. His marriage was on the brink, and he was considering a decision that could change his life forever. My heart pounded. The hospital expected me to be present, efficient, reliable. But as a pastor, I was called to be compassionate, to offer counsel in moments of crisis. I stood frozen, torn between the beeping monitors and the silent plea for help, feeling the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me."}
