The manager expected me to keep everything stocked and organized, never letting anything run out. As I counted, my mind wandered to the pamphlet tucked in my bag\u2014the one about Hajj. My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my head, reminding me that every Muslim should strive to perform the pilgrimage at least once. But the numbers in my bank account were as sparse as the nearly empty shelf in front of me. \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders. My job demanded focus and responsibility, and I needed every paycheck to support my family. Yet, my faith called me to save for Hajj, to fulfill a duty that felt as essential as breathing. I stared at the nearly empty bottle of floor cleaner, feeling the same emptiness inside. How could I balance the expectations of my work with the longing in my heart to answer the call of my faith? The list in my hand blurred as I tried to steady myself, caught between two worlds that seemed impossible to reconcile."}
