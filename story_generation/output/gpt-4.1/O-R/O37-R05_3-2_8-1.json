As a housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to follow every safety protocol\u2014gloves, mask, sanitizer, no exceptions. The supervisor had been clear: one slip, and I\u2019d be written up. But as I scrubbed the hallway, my phone buzzed with a reminder: Shabbat was approaching, and as the rabbi, I was expected to prepare the weekly sermon, to offer guidance and comfort to my congregation. My mind raced with verses and messages, but my body was tethered to the mop and the rules of hygiene. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the crisp apron and the rabbinic tallit\u2014pressing on my shoulders. The congregation needed inspiration, but the hotel needed spotless rooms. I glanced at the clock, torn between the demands of cleanliness and the call to spiritual leadership, my heart pounding as I realized I couldn\u2019t meet both expectations at once."}
