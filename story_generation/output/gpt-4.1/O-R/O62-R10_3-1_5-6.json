A quick check confirmed my suspicion\u2014the filtration system was malfunctioning. As a lifeguard, I knew I had to act fast. Swimmers\u2019 safety depended on clean, clear water, and if I didn\u2019t address the issue immediately, someone could get hurt. I started to head toward the maintenance room, but the sound of drums and laughter drifted in from outside. Through the fence, I caught sight of bright marigold garlands and the familiar swirl of saris. Today was the local Hindu festival, and my family and community expected me to join in the prayers and rituals. I felt a tug in my chest. My heart longed to be part of the celebration, to honor my faith and traditions, but my duty as a lifeguard pressed on me just as hard. I stood at the edge of the pool, torn between the urgent call of my responsibilities and the deep pull of my heritage, unsure which path to take."}
