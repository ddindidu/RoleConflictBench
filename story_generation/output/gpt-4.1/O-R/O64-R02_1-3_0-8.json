My mind was half on the beeping scanner, half on the text I\u2019d just received: a family from my parish needed me to lead a last-minute preparation session for their child\u2019s sacrament\u2014tonight, no exceptions. As a cashier, I was expected to stay until my shift ended, making sure every transaction was perfect, every drawer balanced. But as a priest, I was the only one who could guide this family through the final steps of their child\u2019s spiritual journey. I could see the mother\u2019s anxious face in my mind, hear the urgency in her voice. Yet, here I was, tied to the register, with my manager expecting me to finish my shift without complaint. My hands moved automatically, but my heart was torn, caught between the demands of my job and my calling, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
