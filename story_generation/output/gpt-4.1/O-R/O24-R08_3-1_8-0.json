My heart skipped. The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was explaining. The courtroom\u2019s eyes were on me, waiting for guidance. I felt the weight of my duty as a judge: I must stay current, adapt instantly, and ensure justice is served according to the latest law. But as the tension mounted, my mind drifted to the evening I had planned\u2014a rare, peaceful night to recite and reflect on the Quran, to nourish my faith and find solace in its verses. The expectation to be a just, informed judge clashed with my longing for spiritual fulfillment. I felt torn, the demands of my profession and my faith pulling me in opposite directions. The courtroom waited, the Quran waited, and I stood in the middle, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
