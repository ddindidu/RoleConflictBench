The law demands precision, and I pride myself on staying current with every precedent. Suddenly, my clerk slips me a note\u2014an urgent Supreme Court ruling has just overturned the very precedent I\u2019m explaining. My mind races. I must halt, reassess, and ensure justice is served according to the latest law. But as I pause, my phone vibrates with a gentle reminder: it\u2019s Ramadan\u2019s midpoint, and I\u2019m behind on my daily Quran recitation. I promised myself I\u2019d catch up today, to reflect and reconnect spiritually. Now, the courtroom\u2019s tension collides with my private guilt. The law expects my undivided attention, but my faith calls for quiet reflection. I feel torn, standing at the intersection of duty and devotion, the expectations of justice and the pull of my soul both demanding more than I can give in this moment."}
