Pilots\u2019 voices overlapped, each awaiting my revised climb instructions to keep them safe. My headset pressed tight, sweat beading on my brow, I felt the weight of their trust. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee: the backup imam was unexpectedly absent, and the congregation was gathering, expecting me to lead the prayer. The call to prayer would sound in minutes. My heart pounded\u2014my duty to the pilots was clear, but so was my responsibility to the worshippers who looked to me for spiritual guidance. I imagined the congregation waiting, glancing at the clock, while in the tower, every second counted for the aircraft in my care.
