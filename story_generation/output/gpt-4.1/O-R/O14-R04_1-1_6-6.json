The maintenance checklist was due soon, and as the lead scientist, I was expected to ensure every piece of equipment was in perfect order, even if nothing seemed amiss. Safety protocols were non-negotiable, and my team relied on my diligence. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from Ahmed, a community member who had mentioned earlier that he wanted to talk\u2014nothing urgent, just whenever I had a moment. As the imam, I knew how much people valued my guidance, especially when they reached out, even casually. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the lab\u2019s silent demand for precision and the community\u2019s quiet need for presence. My mind raced, torn between the sterile hum of the lab and the warmth of a conversation that might offer someone comfort. I stood in the hallway, checklist in one hand, phone in the other, heart caught between duty and compassion, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
