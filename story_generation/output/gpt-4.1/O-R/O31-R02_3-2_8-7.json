As a police officer, I was expected to testify in court that afternoon\u2014my duty to uphold justice, to speak the truth, to ensure fairness for all. The subpoena was clear: my presence was not optional. Yet, as a priest, I was also expected to lead the weekly religious education class for the children of my parish. Parents trusted me to guide their children, to nurture their faith, to be present and reliable. Both roles demanded my integrity, my time, my undivided attention. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing down on me, the fear of letting someone down gnawing at my conscience. I could already imagine the disappointment in the children\u2019s eyes if I canceled, the frustration of the court if I failed to appear. My heart pounded as I sat at my desk, torn between two worlds, each calling me to serve, each unwilling to wait."}
