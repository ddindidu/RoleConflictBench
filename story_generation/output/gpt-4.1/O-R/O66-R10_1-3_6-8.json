As a taxi driver, I took pride in keeping my car immaculate for every passenger. Today, though, my mind was elsewhere. My family had called twice already, reminding me that the festival was about to begin. It was one of the most important Hindu ceremonies of the year, and I was expected to be there, to join in the prayers, the offerings, the rituals that connected me to my faith and my ancestors.\n\nBut the festival was far away, and I still had a few rides left before I could even think about leaving. If I rushed, I might make it in time, but the cab would be left unattended, and I wouldn\u2019t have time to clean it after a long day\u2019s work. My passengers expected a clean, professional ride, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. Yet, the thought of missing the festival gnawed at me. I could almost hear the temple bells and smell the incense, but I was stuck, torn between my duty to my passengers and my devotion to my faith."}
