I straighten my headset, ready to greet the next customer. Most days, the script is my shield\u2014every objection, every question, I have a line ready. Today is no different; the callers are polite, their questions predictable, and I handle each with practiced calm. Yet, as the clock ticks closer to six, my mind drifts to the Buddhist study circle meeting tonight. We\u2019re discussing a new chapter, one I haven\u2019t had time to read. The expectation is clear: arrive prepared, contribute thoughtfully, deepen my understanding. But the calls keep coming, and my supervisor expects me to stay until the last minute, to never let a customer feel rushed. I feel the tension coil in my chest\u2014my duty to my job, my commitment to my spiritual path. The phone rings again. I hesitate, torn between answering with my usual cheerful script and the urge to step away, to honor the quiet promise I made to myself and my sangha."}
