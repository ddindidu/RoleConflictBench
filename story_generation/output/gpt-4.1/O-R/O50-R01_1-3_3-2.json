Next week\u2019s shutdown was my window to service the machines\u2014cleaning, oiling, tightening every bolt. If I missed it, the factory\u2019s production could stall, and everyone would be looking at me. My supervisor had already reminded me twice: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any downtime, not now.\u201d\n\nBut then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. Her words were frantic\u2014her son was in trouble, and she needed me to come right away. As their pastor, I was the one they turned to in crisis, the one expected to listen, to guide, to help them find hope when things seemed hopeless. I could hear the desperation in her voice, the weight of her need pressing on me.\n\nI felt torn, standing between the humming machines and the silent sanctuary. Both roles demanded all of me, but I only had one self to give. My hands trembled as I tried to decide where I was needed most, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
