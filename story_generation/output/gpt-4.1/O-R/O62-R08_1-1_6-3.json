But just as I settled in, my phone buzzed. The community pool was short-staffed, and they needed me to fill in as a lifeguard. I hesitated, glancing down at my outfit. The standard lifeguard uniform was a short-sleeved shirt and shorts, nothing like what I was wearing now. \n\nAt the pool, I noticed a group of kids slipping into the shallow end without supervision. My training told me I had to be vigilant, ready to jump in at a moment\u2019s notice, and enforce the safety rules. But I also felt the weight of my faith, the expectation to dress modestly, even in public spaces. I could feel the eyes of the swimmers and my coworkers, wondering if I\u2019d change into the uniform or insist on my own attire. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge, torn between the duty to protect and the commitment to my beliefs, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
