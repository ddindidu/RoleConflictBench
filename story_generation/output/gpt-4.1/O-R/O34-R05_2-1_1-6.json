Holiday travel always brings this chaos\u2014voices crackle in my headset, pilots anxious for updates, and I juggle altitudes and vectors, trying to keep the sky safe and the delays minimal. My supervisor expects precision, calm, and above all, no mistakes. In the middle of this, my phone buzzes with a message from a young couple in my congregation. They\u2019re planning their wedding for next year and want to know if I\u2019ll officiate. As their rabbi, I know how much it means to them to have me there, to guide them through the ceremony, to bless their union. I can almost hear their hope in the text. But I can\u2019t check my calendar now, not with a dozen jets stacked up and every second counting. My mind tugs in two directions\u2014toward the sacred trust of my congregation and the relentless demands of the airspace. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each expecting my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
