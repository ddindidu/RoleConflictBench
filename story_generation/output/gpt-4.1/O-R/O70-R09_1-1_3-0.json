My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cTorah study with kids, 6:00 PM.\u201d I glanced at the time\u20145:55. The house was dark, no answer at the door, and the delivery app insisted on a photo for proof. I knew the package had to be left somewhere safe, but the porch was exposed, and the neighbor\u2019s dog barked at every movement. My mind raced with the responsibility to secure the delivery, not just for the company, but for the person waiting for what might be important.\n\nAt the same time, I pictured my children at home, waiting for our weekly study. I\u2019d promised them stories about our ancestors, about resilience and faith. I wanted to be the parent who passed on our traditions, who made time for what matters. But now, I was torn\u2014do I rush the delivery, risking the package, or do I take the extra time to find a safer spot, knowing it\u2019ll make me late for our lesson? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
