Company policy is clear: every confirmation, no matter how routine, deserves a formal reply. I started drafting a polite response, but then I noticed a discrepancy in the payment amount. It was a small error, one that would go unnoticed if I simply replied with the standard acknowledgment. My manager once hinted that minor mistakes like this could be ignored to keep things running smoothly. \n\nBut as a Christian, I\u2019m taught to value honesty and integrity, even in the smallest matters. My conscience tugged at me\u2014should I mention the error and risk complicating things, or just send the expected reply and move on? The pressure to meet my professional obligations clashed with my desire to live out my faith. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my heart pounding as I wrestled with what to do next."}
