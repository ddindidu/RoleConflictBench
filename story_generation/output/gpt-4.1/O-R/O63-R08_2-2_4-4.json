My manager\u2019s reminders echo in my mind: \u201cWe need those numbers up, everyone.\u201d The pressure is suffocating. I know if I don\u2019t make it, my performance review will suffer. But my thoughts are interrupted by a calendar alert: the office function is this afternoon. Everyone will be there, including upper management. I want to make a good impression, but I also know the dress code is more relaxed, and most of my colleagues will be wearing short sleeves and fitted clothes. \n\nAs a Muslim, I always try to dress modestly\u2014long sleeves, loose clothing, nothing too flashy. But I worry about standing out, about being seen as distant or not fitting in. I can already imagine the curious glances, the subtle questions. Part of me wants to blend in, to be just another face in the crowd, especially with my sales numbers on the line. But another part of me knows what my faith asks of me. The expectations from both sides pull at me, and I feel the tension rising as the clock ticks down."}
