She smiled warmly, and I knew she expected the usual: a friendly greeting, a cup of chai, and a few minutes of easy conversation before her appointment. The receptionist was free, but Mrs. Patel always preferred my welcome. I glanced at the clock\u2014barely an hour left before I needed to leave for the family puja. My mother had called twice already, reminding me to come straight home, change into my kurta, and help with the preparations. The thought of missing the opening prayers or arriving late in my work clothes made my stomach twist with guilt. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the expectation to be the attentive, caring hairdresser my clients loved, and the dutiful Hindu daughter my family relied on during festivals. As Mrs. Patel approached, her eyes bright with anticipation, I felt torn, caught between the warmth of my salon and the sacredness of my home."}
