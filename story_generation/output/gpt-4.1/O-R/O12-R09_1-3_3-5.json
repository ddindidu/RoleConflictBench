I want to be there, to collaborate, to help shape what we build next. But then I see the attached menu for the catered lunch: nothing is kosher-certified, and the options are all mixed or unclear. I picture the spread\u2014sandwiches, salads, maybe some desserts\u2014none of which I can eat. Bringing my own food would make me stand out, and skipping the meal would mean missing the informal conversations where ideas really flow. I feel the pressure from both sides: my team expects me to contribute, to be present, to help define our direction. My faith expects me to honor my dietary laws, to hold fast even when it\u2019s inconvenient. I sit at my desk, torn, the invitation open on my screen, wondering how I can possibly meet both expectations."}
