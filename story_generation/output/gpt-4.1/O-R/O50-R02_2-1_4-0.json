The missed service window gnawed at me\u2014if I didn\u2019t act soon, a breakdown was inevitable. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime. Keep them running.\u201d I reached for my toolkit, but my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder: the daily prayer service was about to begin. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead, to offer comfort and guidance, even if today\u2019s service was optional.
