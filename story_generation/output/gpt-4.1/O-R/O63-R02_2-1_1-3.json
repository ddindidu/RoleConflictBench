How can I help you today?\u201d The man on the other end immediately launched into a barrage of technical questions about our new internet package\u2014questions my script only half-covered. I tried to sound confident, flipping through the FAQ, but my answers felt hollow. I could sense his frustration growing, and I felt the pressure to keep him interested, to not lose another potential sale.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with a message from Mary, a parishioner. \u201cHi, Alex. I was wondering if we could talk sometime soon? I\u2019ve been struggling and could use some guidance.\u201d My heart twisted. As a priest, I was supposed to be present, compassionate, available. But right now, I was supposed to be persuasive, knowledgeable, and efficient. I glanced at the clock, torn between the demands of my job and the needs of my congregation.
