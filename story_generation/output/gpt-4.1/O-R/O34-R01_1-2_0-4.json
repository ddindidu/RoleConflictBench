The radar screen is almost empty, and for once, I can breathe without the constant pressure of managing a dozen holding patterns. My headset crackles with routine check-ins, but nothing urgent. I sip my coffee, grateful for the lull. Then my phone vibrates\u2014a message from a member of my congregation. She\u2019s in the hospital with her son, desperate for comfort, her words raw with fear and exhaustion. As a pastor, I know she expects me to be present, to offer guidance and hope, to be the steady hand she needs right now. But as an air traffic controller, I can\u2019t just leave my post, not even in this rare moment of calm. The weight of both roles presses on me: the responsibility to keep the skies safe, and the call to shepherd my flock. I stare at the empty radar, my heart torn, knowing that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
