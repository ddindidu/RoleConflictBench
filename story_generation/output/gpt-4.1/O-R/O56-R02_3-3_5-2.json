She glared at her reflection, her voice rising with every complaint about the cut I\u2019d just finished. I apologized, offered to fix it, but she wouldn\u2019t be soothed. My coworkers glanced over, anxious to close up and go home. I felt their impatience, but I couldn\u2019t rush her out\u2014not if I wanted to uphold my reputation as a caring hairdresser.\n\nYet, in the back of my mind, the church bells tolled in my memory. Tonight was the most important religious holiday of the year, and as the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers and offer comfort to the largest gathering we\u2019d have all year. People would already be arriving, waiting for me to open the service. My phone buzzed with messages from parishioners, asking if I was on my way.\n\nI stood between the mirror and the door, heart pounding, torn between the angry client demanding my attention and the congregation waiting for my guidance."}
