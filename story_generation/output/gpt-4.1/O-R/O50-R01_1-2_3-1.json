The machines needed thorough maintenance\u2014cleaning, oiling, and replacing worn parts. My supervisor had emphasized the importance of this routine servicing; any delay could mean costly breakdowns. I was determined to do it right, to keep everything running smoothly.\n\nJust as I finished, my phone buzzed. It was Sarah from church. Her message was urgent: she needed to talk, struggling with a decision that weighed heavily on her spirit. As her pastor, I knew she expected me to listen, to offer comfort and guidance. She trusted me to help her find clarity and peace.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting. The machines demanded my attention, and the team relied on me to keep them in top shape. But Sarah needed me, too\u2014someone to lean on in her moment of crisis. I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, torn between the demands of metal and faith, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both my full self at the same time."}
