The court had scheduled a procedural hearing for one of my clients\u2014a minor matter, nothing urgent, and I knew I could request a postponement without much trouble. Still, as a lawyer, I felt the weight of my client\u2019s trust, the expectation that I would be present, attentive, and reliable, no matter how small the case. But the hearing was set for the same hour as my weekly religious school class, where I was expected as the rabbi to teach Torah to a group of eager children. Their parents counted on me to guide their kids, to be a steady presence in their spiritual lives. I could almost hear the children\u2019s voices, see their faces light up with curiosity. I felt torn, pulled by the duty to my client and the responsibility to my congregation. Both roles demanded my presence, my commitment, and I could not be in two places at once. The pressure built inside me as I weighed the expectations, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
