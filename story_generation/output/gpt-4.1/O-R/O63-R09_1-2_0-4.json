My script is open in front of me, and I\u2019m ready for the next call. Most days, the objections are easy\u2014questions about the product, concerns about price. I know the answers by heart, and I handle each one smoothly, as expected. But today, my stomach growls. I skipped breakfast, and now, during my short lunch break, I realize the only food nearby is from a small vendor I know is kosher-certified. It\u2019s a relief, but the line is long, and my break is short. If I wait, I\u2019ll be late returning to my calls, risking a reprimand from my supervisor. If I skip the meal, I\u2019ll be hungry and distracted, but at least I\u2019ll be on time. The expectation to be a reliable telemarketer clashes with my commitment to keeping kosher. I stare at the clock, feeling the pressure from both sides, unsure which role I\u2019m about to let down."}
