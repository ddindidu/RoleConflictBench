As a lifeguard, I know I have to enforce the rules, keep everyone safe, and not let anything slide. My supervisor expects vigilance, and parents trust me with their children\u2019s lives. But as I watch the water ripple, my mind drifts to something else\u2014my savings, carefully set aside for years, meant for my pilgrimage to Mecca. This year, my friends are going, and they keep sending me messages, urging me to join them. The money I\u2019ve saved is just enough, but if I take time off now, I risk losing this job, and the pool needs me during the busy summer. The pressure builds inside me, the weight of duty and faith pulling me in opposite directions. I grip the whistle tighter, feeling the tension between the responsibility to protect these kids and the longing to fulfill a pillar of my faith. The laughter of the teenagers echoes, and my heart pounds as I stand caught between two worlds, unsure which call to answer."}
