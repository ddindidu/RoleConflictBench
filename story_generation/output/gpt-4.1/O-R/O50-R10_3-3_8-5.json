As the machine repairer, I was expected to guide them, to ensure they understood every safety protocol before starting a batch. But they seemed impatient, eager to prove themselves, brushing off my warnings. My supervisor, pressed for time, signaled me to let them proceed. Yet, I noticed a shortcut being taken\u2014one that could endanger lives. \n\nAt the same time, my heart pounded with the teachings I grew up with as a Hindu: dharma, the duty to act righteously, to prevent harm and stand against wrongdoing. I saw a senior technician slip money to a manager, ignoring the safety checklist entirely. My mind raced\u2014should I confront them, risking my job and reputation, or stay silent and let the batch run, betraying my values? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I felt torn, caught between my duty as a repairer and my conscience as a Hindu."}
