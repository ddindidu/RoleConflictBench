The safety audit was only hours away, and I knew the inspectors would be thorough\u2014especially after the minor issues flagged last week. As the lead scientist, it was my responsibility to ensure every protocol was followed, every piece of equipment spotless and functional. My colleagues depended on me to keep our lab\u2019s reputation intact.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with reminders from the mosque committee. Today was not just any Friday\u2014it was the anniversary of our community\u2019s founding, and people had travelled from distant towns to hear my sermon. As the imam, I was expected to deliver words that would inspire and unite, to be present and attentive to every member of the congregation. The weight of their expectations pressed on me; I could not let them down.\n\nCaught between the sterile urgency of the lab and the spiritual anticipation at the mosque, I felt my chest tighten. Both worlds demanded my full presence, but I could not be in two places at once. My hands trembled as I tried to focus, torn by the impossible choice before me."}
