The court had scheduled a procedural hearing for one of my clients\u2014a minor matter, nothing urgent, and I knew I could request a postponement without much trouble. Still, as their lawyer, I was expected to be present, to show commitment and diligence, even for the small things. At the same time, tonight was the adult education class at the synagogue. It was an optional, drop-in session, but I knew several people were looking forward to it. As their rabbi, I was expected to be there, to teach, to answer questions, to guide. I could almost hear the disappointment in their voices if I canceled last minute. The two roles pulled at me from opposite sides\u2014my client\u2019s trust in my professional reliability, my congregation\u2019s trust in my spiritual leadership. I sat at my desk, torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down, unsure which responsibility I would have to let down."}
