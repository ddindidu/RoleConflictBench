My phone buzzed\u2014opposing counsel again, pressing for details about my client\u2019s finances. I could hear the edge in his voice, the subtle threat beneath his words. As a lawyer, I knew my duty: protect my client, uphold confidentiality, never betray trust. But the pressure was mounting, and I felt the weight of the case bearing down on me.\n\nAt the same time, my phone chimed with a gentle reminder: the temple\u2019s evening chant would begin soon. As a Buddhist, I was expected to join, to be present with my community, to let go of worldly concerns and cultivate peace. The thought of the incense, the rhythmic chanting, the calm faces of my fellow practitioners called to me. Yet, I was tethered to my desk, mind racing with legal strategy and ethical boundaries.\n\nCaught between the demands of my profession and the pull of my spiritual community, I felt my chest tighten. I closed my eyes, torn, the expectations of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to follow tonight."}
