As a doctor, I know I must walk into the waiting room and tell a family that their loved one\u2019s condition is grave. I can already hear their anxious voices through the door, and I know they expect me to be clear, honest, and compassionate. My training tells me to be present for them, to answer their questions, to hold space for their pain.\n\nBut as a Buddhist, I had planned to spend these ten minutes in quiet meditation, to ground myself in mindfulness before facing the emotional storm. I promised myself this window of stillness, a chance to breathe and find clarity. Now, the two roles pull at me\u2014one demanding immediate action and empathy, the other urging me to pause and center myself. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the needs of others and the need to care for my own mind. The voices grow louder, and I feel the conflict sharpen inside me, unsure which path to take."}
