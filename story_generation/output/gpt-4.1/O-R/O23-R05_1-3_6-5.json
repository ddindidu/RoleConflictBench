I\u2019ve heard rumors.\u201d The lawyer in me bristled, knowing I was bound by confidentiality, that even a hint could betray trust and ethics. But as I tried to deflect, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that the conversion candidate\u2019s final study session was about to begin. As their rabbi, I was expected to guide them, to answer their last questions before the Beit Din, a moment that could shape their spiritual life forever. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: the lawyer, silent and guarded; the rabbi, open and present. The room\u2019s chatter faded as I wrestled with the demands\u2014one role urging discretion, the other calling me to be fully available. My heart pounded, torn between the sacred trust of my client and the sacred responsibility to my student, knowing I could not be in two places, or two selves, at once."}
