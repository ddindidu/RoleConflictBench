My mind should be preparing for mindfulness, but instead, it\u2019s tangled in the puzzle of Mrs. Lee, my patient from this morning. Her symptoms\u2014persistent fatigue, odd rashes, and intermittent fevers\u2014don\u2019t fit neatly into any diagnosis I know. I\u2019ve run the tests, reviewed her history, but nothing adds up. As a doctor, I feel the weight of responsibility to find answers, to not let her down. Yet, as a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to let go, to be present, to quiet my mind and join my community in meditation. The expectation is to set aside worldly concerns, but how can I, knowing someone\u2019s health may depend on my focus? My heart pounds with the pressure of both roles, each demanding my full attention, each pulling me in opposite directions. I close my eyes, feeling the tension coil in my chest, uncertain which path to follow as the meditation hour approaches."}
