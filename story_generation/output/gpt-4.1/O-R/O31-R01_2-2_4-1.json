My badge felt heavy on my chest\u2014every move I made was about protecting the people here, keeping them safe from further harm. I was focused, alert, and ready to step in if tempers flared or someone needed help. Then, through the chaos, I heard my name. It was Mrs. Carter from my congregation, her face pale and eyes wide with worry. She pulled me aside, her voice trembling as she spoke of her son\u2019s troubles and the impossible choice she faced about his future. She needed her pastor, someone to listen, to offer comfort and wisdom. But I was still in uniform, responsible for the scene, for the safety of everyone around. My mind raced\u2014could I step away, even for a moment, to be the shepherd she needed? Or would that mean failing my duty as an officer? The weight of both uniforms pressed in on me, and I stood there, torn, as the world waited for me to choose which role to answer first."}
