The next phase of the project was ready to launch, and the equipment was finally available for a rare weekend slot. My colleagues were eager, and I knew the data we\u2019d collect could be pivotal. Yet, as I glanced at my other calendar\u2014filled with Torah notes and sermon drafts\u2014I felt a familiar knot in my stomach. The High Holiday was approaching, and the congregation would gather in anticipation of my words, seeking guidance and inspiration. They expected me to be present, prepared, and spiritually attuned. I could reschedule the experiment, but the team\u2019s momentum might falter. If I focused on the lab, my sermon would be rushed, my presence divided. If I poured myself into the sermon, the experiment would wait, but so would the questions I was desperate to answer. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my full devotion, and I sat in the quiet, torn between the call of discovery and the call of faith."}
