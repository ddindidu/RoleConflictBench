My mind drifted to the Quran on my shelf, its familiar cover promising peace and reflection. Tonight, I had planned to spend time reciting and contemplating its verses, something I\u2019d been looking forward to all week. Just as I reached for it, my phone buzzed\u2014a client\u2019s name flashed on the screen. They had a question about a line item on their latest invoice, and I knew they expected a prompt, clear response. As an accountant, I prided myself on being reliable and responsive, always available to address concerns. But as a Muslim, I cherished these rare, uninterrupted moments with the Quran, moments that nourished my spirit. I felt the tension rise inside me, torn between the professional duty to my client and the spiritual commitment I owed myself. My hand hovered between the phone and the Quran, heart pounding as I wrestled with the weight of both expectations."}
