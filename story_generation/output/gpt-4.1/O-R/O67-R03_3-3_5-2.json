Dispatch had said it was a major heart attack\u2014every second mattered. As an ambulance driver, I was trained to focus, to push aside everything but the patient\u2019s life in my care. But my phone buzzed again, a message from the mayor: \u201cSister, we need you. The hurricane\u2019s left hundreds homeless. Please help organize the relief effort.\u201d My heart clenched. As a nun, I was expected to serve, to be present for my community in their darkest hour. I pictured the faces of those huddled in the church hall, waiting for guidance, for hope. Yet here I was, responsible for a single fragile life in the back of my ambulance, while so many others needed me elsewhere. The weight of both uniforms pressed on my shoulders, the demands of duty and devotion pulling me in opposite directions. I gripped the steering wheel tighter, torn between the siren\u2019s urgent call and the silent plea of my community, unsure which path to follow."}
