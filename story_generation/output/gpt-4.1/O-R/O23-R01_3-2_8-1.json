As a lawyer, I had just left a tense call with opposing counsel, who hinted\u2014no, demanded\u2014that I reveal information about my client. The law was clear: confidentiality was sacred. Yet the pressure was immense, and I knew that withholding this detail could shift the entire case. My client\u2019s trust in me was absolute, and I couldn\u2019t betray that.\n\nNo sooner had I hung up than my phone buzzed again. It was a member of my congregation, desperate for guidance. She was facing a life-altering decision, her voice trembling with uncertainty. As her pastor, I was expected to offer wisdom, to be open and compassionate, to help her find clarity and peace.\n\nBut my mind was split. The lawyer in me was locked in a battle of ethics and loyalty, while the pastor in me was called to be present, empathetic, and wise. I felt the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my full attention, each with its own code I could not ignore. My heart pounded as I tried to find the right words, knowing I could not fail either calling."}
