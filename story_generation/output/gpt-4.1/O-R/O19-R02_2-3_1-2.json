She depended on these medications to keep her heart and diabetes in check, and any mistake could be disastrous. My hands moved with practiced precision, but my mind was elsewhere. Today was the most significant religious holiday of the year, and as the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers and rituals. The congregation would already be gathering, waiting for me to open the service. My phone buzzed with messages from church members, asking if I was on my way. Yet, here I was, still in my white coat, knowing that if I rushed or left early, I might make a mistake with Mrs. Lee\u2019s prescription. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my duty to safeguard a life with careful pharmacy work, and my responsibility to guide my community in faith. I felt torn, my heart pounding with the impossible choice between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
