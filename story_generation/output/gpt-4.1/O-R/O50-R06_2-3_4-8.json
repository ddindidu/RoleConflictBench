The machines were running hotter than they should\u2014last week\u2019s missed service window was catching up with us. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford another breakdown. Get those machines cleaned and serviced, now.\u201d I knew what was at stake\u2014production quotas, people\u2019s jobs, my own reputation as a reliable repairer.\n\nJust as I reached for my toolbox, I noticed Maria, one of the newer workers, sitting on a crate near the back, her face buried in her hands. She looked lost, on the verge of tears. I remembered the sermon from Sunday: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d I felt the pull to go to her, to offer comfort, to be the kind of Christian I strive to be. But the machines needed me, and the clock was ticking. If I stopped now, I\u2019d be letting down my team, risking a costly breakdown. My heart pounded as I stood between the machines and Maria, torn by the demands of my work and my faith, unsure which call to answer first."}
