My phone buzzed with a reminder: the weekly newsletter from the state pharmacy board. I knew I needed to keep up\u2014new drugs, new protocols, always something changing. If I missed something important, it could affect my patients. I scrolled through the headlines, trying to absorb as much as I could in the few minutes I had.\n\nBut then my other phone chimed, this time with a message from the synagogue group chat. Tonight was the routine weekday service. I\u2019d promised myself, and my community, that I\u2019d attend regularly. It wasn\u2019t a high holiday, and the minyan would likely be fine without me, but I knew how much it mattered to show up, to be counted, to keep the rhythm of our tradition alive.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My profession demanded constant vigilance and learning; my faith asked for presence and commitment. I stared at the clock, heart pounding, torn between the sterile glow of my screen and the warm pull of my community, unsure which expectation I would let down tonight."}
