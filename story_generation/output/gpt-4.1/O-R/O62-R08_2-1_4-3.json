As a Muslim, I always make sure to dress modestly, especially when I\u2019m not expecting to leave the house. But just as I settled in, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the pool manager. The morning swim lessons were about to start, but a lane rope had snapped, and no one else was available to fix it. As the lifeguard on call, I was expected to maintain the equipment and make sure everything was safe and ready. I glanced down at my relaxed, modest clothes, knowing I\u2019d have to change into my work uniform\u2014shorts and a fitted shirt\u2014if I went. The thought made me uneasy, torn between my responsibility to the pool and my commitment to my faith. My mind raced, weighing the urgency of the broken rope against my desire to honor my beliefs. I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, caught between two worlds and unsure which expectation I should meet."}
