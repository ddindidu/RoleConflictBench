As an engineer, I knew the importance of accuracy\u2014my team depended on realistic timelines. But the session was casual, and everyone seemed relaxed, joking about how deadlines always move anyway. Still, I felt the pressure to give a number that wouldn\u2019t disappoint anyone or make me seem uncommitted.\n\nJust then, I noticed Sarah, a new team member, looking anxious and out of place. As a Christian, I felt a tug to reach out, to offer a kind word or reassurance, maybe even invite her to lunch. But if I focused on her now, I might miss a key detail in the planning, or worse, give a rushed estimate that could throw off the whole project. My mind raced between the expectation to be a reliable engineer and the call to show kindness, both feeling urgent and important. I could feel the tension tightening in my chest, unsure which role to honor in this moment."}
