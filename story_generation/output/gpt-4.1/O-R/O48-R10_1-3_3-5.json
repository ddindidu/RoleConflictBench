The hospital was busy, and I knew every minute counted. But as I reached for the blood pressure cuff, I overheard two staff members in the hallway discussing how they\u2019d altered a patient\u2019s chart to cover up a medication error. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma\u2014truth and righteousness\u2014no matter the cost. My mind raced with the weight of my duty to report this wrongdoing, to protect the vulnerable. Yet, I was also expected to complete my rounds quickly and efficiently, not to get involved in matters outside my assigned tasks. I felt torn, my hands trembling as I tried to focus on Mr. Patel\u2019s pulse. The pressure of my dual responsibilities pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, caught between my role as a diligent nursing assistant and my deeper calling to act with moral courage."}
