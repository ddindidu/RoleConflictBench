The patient before me coughed softly, her chart showing nothing more than a mild fever and congestion\u2014likely just a cold. Still, as a doctor, I knew I had to be thorough, to listen, to check for anything more serious. My stethoscope hung around my neck, a constant reminder of my duty to diagnose with care and precision.\n\nBut my habit, folded neatly in my bag, called to me with equal urgency. Today, I was to lead the prayer vigil at the cathedral, representing my convent in front of hundreds. The sisters had placed their trust in me, expecting my presence and spiritual guidance. The event would begin in less than an hour, and I could not be late.\n\nMy mind raced between the patient\u2019s needs and the convent\u2019s expectations. Should I rush the examination, risking a missed diagnosis, or delay my arrival at the vigil, disappointing my sisters and the community? The weight of both callings pressed on my heart, and I stood frozen, torn between the two worlds that defined me."}
