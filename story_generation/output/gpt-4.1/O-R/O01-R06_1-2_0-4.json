As an architect, I knew the importance of safety and compliance\u2014every detail mattered. Today, I noticed a few minor inconsistencies in the building plan. They weren\u2019t likely to cause immediate issues, but they nagged at me. Fixing them would mean staying late, double-checking calculations, and possibly delaying the project. \n\nBut it was Sunday, and as a Christian, I was expected at church. Worship and community were not just rituals; they were the core of my faith, a time to reconnect and serve. I could already imagine the empty seat in the pew, the missed conversations, the subtle disappointment in my pastor\u2019s eyes. \n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder for the service. I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. The plans needed my attention, but so did my faith community. My heart wrestled with the demands, torn between professional responsibility and spiritual commitment, unsure which expectation I would ultimately meet."}
