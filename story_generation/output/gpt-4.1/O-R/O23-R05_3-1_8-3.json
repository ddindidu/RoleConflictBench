As a lawyer, I had just finished a tense call with opposing counsel, who was relentless in trying to extract privileged information about my client. The ethical boundaries were clear\u2014confidentiality was paramount, and I could not betray my client\u2019s trust, no matter how much pressure was applied. Yet, as I hung up, my phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was the adult education class at the synagogue. As the rabbi, I was expected to be present, to teach Torah, to guide and inspire those who came, even if only a handful showed up. I glanced at the clock, feeling the hours slip away as I reviewed case files, my mind torn. My client needed me to be vigilant, to prepare for tomorrow\u2019s hearing, but my congregation expected my presence and wisdom. The demands of both roles pulled at me, each rooted in responsibility and care, yet tonight, they felt impossibly at odds. My heart pounded as I weighed the sacred trust of my client against the sacred duty to my community, uncertain which call I would answer."}
