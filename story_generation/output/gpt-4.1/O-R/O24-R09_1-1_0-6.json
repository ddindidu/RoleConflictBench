As a judge, I was expected to review every case file with care, no matter how routine the hearing seemed. The procedural hearing was scheduled in two weeks, but the file had just arrived, and I knew the court valued thoroughness and preparation. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I realized the Friday evening service at synagogue would begin soon. My faith taught me the importance of regular attendance, of joining the community in prayer and reflection. I could miss tonight\u2014attendance was usually strong\u2014but I felt the familiar tug of obligation, the sense that I should be there, part of something larger than myself. My mind raced between the demands: the silent expectation of the court, the quiet pull of my faith. I stared at the unopened file, my heart caught between duty and devotion, unsure which path to follow tonight."}
