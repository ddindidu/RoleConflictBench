My manager\u2019s voice echoes in my head: \u201cWe need three more sales to hit target, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d I clutch my headset, dialing number after number, my script ready, my nerves frayed. At noon, the company hosts a communal lunch to rally the team. The spread is generous\u2014platters of sandwiches, salads, and pastries\u2014but as I scan the table, my heart sinks. None of the food is kosher-certified, and I can\u2019t find any labels or familiar symbols. My stomach growls, but I know the rules: I\u2019m expected to keep kosher, even when it\u2019s inconvenient. My colleagues urge me to eat, to keep my energy up for the final sales push. I feel their eyes on me, waiting for me to join in, to be part of the team. The pressure mounts\u2014do I risk my religious commitment for the sake of camaraderie and performance, or do I stand apart, hungry and distracted, as the clock ticks down? My hands tremble as I hover over the food, torn between two worlds, unsure which expectation I can bear to disappoint."}
