I\u2019ve been with your company for years, and now you want my credit card again?\u201d My script fluttered uselessly in my hand. As a telemarketer, I was supposed to stay calm, answer every question, and keep him on the line. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed: \u201cDon\u2019t let them hang up. Address every concern.\u201d But my eyes kept darting to the clock. In fifteen minutes, I was supposed to be at the synagogue, leading the weekly adult Torah class. People would be gathering, expecting me to guide them through the text, to answer their questions with patience and wisdom. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one demanding I soothe and persuade, the other that I teach and inspire. My heart pounded as Mr. Feldman\u2019s voice grew louder, and I wondered how I could possibly be both the calm, persistent telemarketer and the thoughtful, present rabbi at the same time."}
