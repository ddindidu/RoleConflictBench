As a taxi driver, I knew I had to be extra cautious\u2014visibility was low, and cars darted unpredictably between lanes. Every instinct told me to focus, to keep my eyes on the road and obey every traffic law. But then my phone buzzed with a message from a church member, someone I\u2019d counseled before. \u201cCan you talk? It\u2019s urgent. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\u201d My heart clenched. As a pastor, I was expected to be there, to offer comfort and guidance, especially in moments of crisis. But the rain was relentless, and the city\u2019s chaos demanded my full attention. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me\u2014should I pull over and risk being late for my next fare, or ignore the message and risk letting someone down in their darkest hour? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
