As a judge, I knew I had to read and understand the ruling before tomorrow\u2019s session. The law demanded diligence, and I prided myself on never being unprepared.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder: the monastery\u2019s annual festival began at dawn. As a practicing Buddhist, I was expected to help with the preparations\u2014sweeping the grounds, arranging offerings, and welcoming the community. This ritual was more than tradition; it was a chance to serve, to practice mindfulness and compassion alongside my sangha.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. The law required my focus and intellect; my faith called for my presence and heart. I stared at the thick legal opinion on my desk, then at the saffron robe folded neatly in my bag. My mind raced, torn between duty to justice and devotion to the path."}
