My heart skipped. A discrepancy\u2014urgent, they said. As an accountant, I knew the gravity of such notices. Compliance wasn\u2019t just a rule; it was my responsibility. I needed to review the ledgers, draft a response, and ensure every figure was justified. The clock ticked louder.\n\nBut then, the church bell chimed. In fifteen minutes, I was expected in the chapel. The daily prayer service, though optional for the congregation, was a commitment I made as their priest. People would gather, seeking comfort, guidance, and the steady rhythm of faith. They counted on me to lead, to be present in spirit and body.\n\nI stared at the computer screen, then at my vestments hanging by the door. The weight of both roles pressed on my chest. If I delayed the tax response, I risked penalties and the trust of my employer. If I missed the prayer, I\u2019d let down my community, perhaps even myself. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which duty called louder."}
