I knew if I didn\u2019t act fast, the whole line could grind to a halt, costing the company thousands and putting everyone behind schedule. My supervisor\u2019s words from this morning rang in my ears: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any downtime today. Stay sharp.\u201d I grabbed my tools, heart pounding, already mapping out the steps in my head\u2014shut down, isolate, replace, test. \n\nBut as I hurried past the break room, I caught sight of Mark slumped at a table, head in his hands. He\u2019d been quiet all week, and I remembered the prayer request he\u2019d shared at church\u2014his wife\u2019s illness, the mounting bills. My faith tells me to be present, to show compassion, to sit with those who are hurting. I felt the weight of Jesus\u2019 words: \u201cLove one another as I have loved you.\u201d \n\nI stood frozen, torn between the urgent call of the machine and the silent plea of a friend in pain. My hands trembled, caught between the wrench and the open door, as I wrestled with what I was truly meant to do."}
