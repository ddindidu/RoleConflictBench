My patient, Mrs. Goldstein, sat across from me, her eyes wide with worry as she tried to process her new diagnosis. She had so many questions\u2014about medications, diet, what this would mean for her future. As her doctor, I knew I needed to give her my full attention, to answer every question with patience and empathy. But my phone buzzed again: a reminder that the bar mitzvah I was to officiate would begin in less than an hour. The family had planned this day for months, and as their rabbi, I was expected to be there, to guide their son through this milestone with warmth and wisdom. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, my care, my heart. My mind raced, torn between the needs of my patient and the expectations of my congregation, knowing that no matter what I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
