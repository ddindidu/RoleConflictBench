The quarterly tax filing deadline loomed just a week away, and as the company\u2019s accountant, I knew every number had to be perfect\u2014no room for error, no bending the rules. My supervisor\u2019s reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any mistakes this quarter.\u201d Yet, as I tried to focus, the convent\u2019s phone rang. Sister Maria\u2019s voice trembled as she told me about the family next door\u2014their home lost to a fire, their children shivering in borrowed coats. As a nun, I was expected to drop everything, to serve, to be present in their hour of need. My heart ached with the urge to help, but my mind raced with deadlines and legal obligations. I stared at the ledger, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down, torn between the urgent needs of my faith and the uncompromising demands of my profession."}
