Her treatment was complex, requiring constant monitoring and precise medication adjustments. As her doctor, I knew any lapse could worsen her condition. My phone buzzed with a message from the mosque: Brother Yusuf wanted to talk, saying he needed spiritual guidance and hoped I could spare some time soon. As the imam, I felt a deep responsibility to be present for my community, to listen and offer counsel whenever someone reached out. \n\nBut the clock was ticking. Mrs. Rahman\u2019s lab results had just come in, and I needed to act quickly to adjust her medications. At the same time, I imagined Yusuf waiting, perhaps struggling with something heavy on his heart, expecting his imam to be available. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my duty to heal and my duty to guide. I felt torn, my mind racing with the demands of both worlds, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
