My regular client, Mrs. Lee, smiled as she settled into my chair. \u201cJust a little trim on the fringe, please,\u201d she said, her tone gentle as always. I glanced at the clock\u2014service at church would start in thirty minutes, and I was supposed to help set up for the community lunch afterward. My pastor had reminded me last week how important it was to be present, not just for worship but for fellowship, too. But Mrs. Lee was a loyal client, and I prided myself on making sure everyone left my chair happy. She hesitated, then asked if I could adjust her fringe just a bit more. I could see she was nervous about it, and I knew how much she trusted me. My hands hovered over her hair, my mind torn. If I rushed, I might disappoint her. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late for church\u2014again. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt my heart race as I tried to decide what to do next."}
