As a lawyer, I was expected to be in court tomorrow, ready to represent my client in a high-stakes jury trial. The judge had made it clear: no delays, no excuses. My client\u2019s future, and a significant sum of money, hung in the balance. At the same time, as the rabbi of my congregation, I was supposed to lead a bar mitzvah ceremony for a young boy who had been preparing for this day for over a year. His family had already sent out invitations, and the community was counting on me to guide him through this milestone. I could feel the expectations from both sides\u2014my client\u2019s anxious calls, the hopeful messages from the boy\u2019s parents. My stomach twisted as I tried to imagine disappointing either side. I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, torn between my duty to justice and my commitment to my faith community, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be let down."}
