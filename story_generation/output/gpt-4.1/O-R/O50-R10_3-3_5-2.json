My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cIf that goes, the whole line stops.\u201d I grabbed my tools, heart pounding, knowing every second mattered. But as I reached for the oil can, my phone buzzed. It was a reminder for my midday puja, the time I always set aside for prayer, chanting, and offerings. My family and community expected me to never miss it, to honor the discipline and devotion that defined my faith. I glanced at the clock. If I started the repair now, I\u2019d miss the ritual. If I left the machine, the breakdown could cost hours of production and my reputation as a reliable repairer. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014one demanding my hands, the other my spirit. I stood frozen, torn between the screeching metal and the silent call of my faith, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing second."}
