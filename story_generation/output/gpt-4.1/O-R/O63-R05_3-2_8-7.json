The automated compliance system was merciless\u2014every unscheduled minute away from my headset was logged, and I\u2019d already been warned about my adherence. My phone vibrated. It was the mother of the bar mitzvah boy, her message urgent: the ceremony was about to begin, and they needed me to arrive early for a last-minute rehearsal. As a rabbi, I knew how much this day meant to the family, how long they\u2019d prepared, and how my presence was essential. But my supervisor had made it clear\u2014no deviations from the schedule, or I\u2019d risk disciplinary action.
