Store policy is clear: every cent must be accounted for, no matter how minor. My manager expects me to report even the smallest error, but I know it won\u2019t affect the total sales for the day. I hesitate, feeling the weight of responsibility pressing on me.\n\nLater, at a communal event, I scan the buffet table. The food looks delicious, but none of the dishes have kosher certification. My friends urge me to join in, and I feel their eyes on me, expecting me to be part of the celebration. Substituting food would be awkward and draw attention, but eating non-kosher goes against everything I\u2019ve been taught.\n\nBoth roles tug at me\u2014one demanding strict adherence to rules, the other asking for flexibility in the name of community and belonging. My mind races, torn between the expectations of my job and my faith, wondering which part of myself I\u2019ll have to compromise."}
