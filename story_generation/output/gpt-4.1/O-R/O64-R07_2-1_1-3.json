My manager\u2019s eyes flick to the clock, silently urging me to move faster, to keep the transactions accurate and the line moving. I scan items, count change, and try to keep my voice calm, but the pressure mounts with every beep of the scanner. In my pocket, my phone vibrates\u2014a gentle reminder for my daily ten-minute meditation, a promise I made to myself as a Buddhist to practice mindfulness, even in chaos. I glance at the clock. This was supposed to be my quiet window, a time to breathe, to let go of stress, to be present. But the demands of the register pull me back: the next customer is already unloading groceries, the line is growing, and I can feel my heart racing. I want to close my eyes, to find stillness, but the world around me demands speed and precision. My hands tremble slightly as I reach for the next item, torn between the need to serve and the need to be still."}
