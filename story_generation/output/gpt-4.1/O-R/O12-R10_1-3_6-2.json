It wasn\u2019t critical\u2014users could easily work around it\u2014but my manager wanted it fixed before the next release. I glanced at the clock. My daily puja time was approaching, and I never missed it. The incense, the chanting, the offerings\u2014they grounded me, gave me peace. But the code was stubborn, and I could feel the pressure mounting as messages from the team pinged in. \u201cAny update?\u201d \u201cCan you push the fix today?\u201d My mind raced between the lines of code and the rituals waiting for me at home. I knew my family expected me to uphold our traditions, to be present and focused during prayers. Yet, my team needed me to be present here, to deliver. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, and I sat frozen, torn between the demands of my faith and my work, unsure which part of myself to let down."}
