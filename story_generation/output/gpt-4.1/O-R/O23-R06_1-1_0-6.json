As a lawyer, I knew I should review every clause, even if it was just a standard service agreement and not due for weeks. My job demanded thoroughness, attention to detail, and a certain detachment\u2014contracts were about risk, not relationships. But as I scrolled through the legalese, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a colleague: her mother was in the hospital, and she was overwhelmed. She needed someone to cover her calls for the afternoon.\n\nI hesitated. My Christian faith taught me to show love and kindness, to be present for others in their time of need. Yet, the lawyer in me whispered about deadlines, about the importance of staying ahead, about not letting personal feelings interfere with professional obligations. I felt the tension coil in my chest\u2014should I set aside the contract and help my colleague, or focus on my work, as expected? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I sat there, torn, unsure which path to take."}
