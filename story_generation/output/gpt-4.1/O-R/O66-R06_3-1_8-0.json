As a taxi driver, I felt the pressure to deliver fast, professional service. My rating depended on it, and so did my income. The passenger\u2019s urgency echoed in my mind, making my hands tense on the wheel.\n\nBut as a Christian, I tried to live by my values every day, even when no one was watching. I remembered the teachings about honesty and respecting the law, about not putting others at risk for my own gain. The shortcut would save time, but it meant breaking the speed limit and possibly endangering people in the quiet neighborhood. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands\u2014should I risk my principles for a better rating and a satisfied customer, or should I hold to my values, even if it meant disappointing someone who was counting on me? The traffic light turned green, and I hesitated, torn between the two roads ahead."}
