As a police officer, I know my duty: enforce the law, maintain order, respond swiftly. But tonight is different. I\u2019m also Sister Maria, and I\u2019ve been chosen to lead the prayer vigil at the city\u2019s cathedral, a rare honor for our convent. The vigil begins in less than an hour, and the sisters are counting on me to guide them in prayer, to be a symbol of calm and faith. Yet, as Officer Ramirez, I\u2019m expected to respond to the call, to show the community that their concerns matter, that the law is upheld. My phone buzzes with a reminder from the convent, while my radio repeats the address of the party. My uniform feels heavier than ever, the weight of my badge and my habit pressing on my shoulders. I stand at the crossroads, torn between the siren\u2019s call of duty and the quiet pull of devotion, knowing that whichever path I choose, I will be letting someone down."}
