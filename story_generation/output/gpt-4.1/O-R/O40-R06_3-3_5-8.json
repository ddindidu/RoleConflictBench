Tomorrow, I start the biggest project of my career\u2014a custom library for the mayor\u2019s house. Every detail matters, and I need to study these drawings carefully to avoid costly mistakes. My mind is already racing with measurements and joinery techniques when my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from my neighbor, Mrs. Evans. Her husband just passed away, and she\u2019s alone, asking if I could come sit with her for a while.\n\nAs a carpenter, I know I should stay focused, double-check every line and angle, make sure I\u2019m ready for the morning. But as a Christian, I feel the pull to comfort her, to show the love and kindness I believe in. The weight of both roles presses on me\u2014one demanding precision and preparation, the other calling for compassion and presence. My heart aches as I stare at the blueprints, torn between the expectations of my craft and the teachings of my faith, unsure which path to take tonight."}
