Children clustered near the curb, their laughter rising above the rumble of engines. The construction detour had squeezed traffic into a single lane, and horns blared behind me. I knew I had to drive carefully\u2014my license, my livelihood, depended on it. But my phone buzzed on the dashboard, a reminder flashing: \u201cHigh Holiday sermon\u2014tonight.\u201d My congregation expected inspiration, guidance, a message that would carry them through the year. I hadn\u2019t finished my notes. My mind raced with Torah passages and half-formed ideas, but I couldn\u2019t let my attention drift. One wrong move, one distracted moment, and a child could be hurt. Yet if I didn\u2019t prepare, I\u2019d let down everyone who looked to me for wisdom. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full presence, each unforgiving of mistakes. I felt torn, my heart pounding as I inched forward, caught between the safety of these children and the spiritual needs of my community, knowing I could not serve both perfectly at the same time."}
