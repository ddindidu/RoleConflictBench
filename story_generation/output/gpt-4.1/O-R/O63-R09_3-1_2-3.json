Explain every detail!\u201d My script fluttered in my hand, but I knew I had to go off-script, answer every question, keep him calm\u2014my supervisor expected nothing less. My stomach rumbled, reminding me I\u2019d skipped lunch. I glanced at the clock: only a few minutes until my break. I\u2019d packed matzo and hummus, kosher, of course, just like my mother taught me. But if I put Mr. Feldman on hold, he might hang up, and I\u2019d lose a sale. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss my only chance to eat before the next round of calls.
