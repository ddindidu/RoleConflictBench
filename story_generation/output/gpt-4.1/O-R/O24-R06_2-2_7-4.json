The new appellate court decision he cited could shift the entire direction of the case. As a judge, I knew I had to review it thoroughly before tomorrow\u2019s session\u2014justice demanded nothing less. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I realized the church service would begin in less than an hour. My congregation expected me there, not just as a participant but as someone who helped lead the youth group. Worship and fellowship were cornerstones of my faith, and I felt a deep responsibility to be present, to nurture my spiritual life and support my community. The legal brief sat open on my desk, while my Bible and church bulletin peeked from my bag. My mind raced, torn between the duty to uphold the law with diligence and the call to honor my faith and commitments. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my time, my presence, and my heart."}
