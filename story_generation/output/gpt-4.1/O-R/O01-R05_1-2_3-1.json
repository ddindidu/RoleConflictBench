The lines on the paper formed walls and doorways, each decision weighed for function and flow. As an architect, I felt the familiar satisfaction of shaping space, of making something useful and beautiful. But the clock on the wall ticked louder with each passing minute, reminding me that Shabbat was approaching. As a rabbi, I was expected to prepare a sermon, to offer words of comfort and wisdom to my congregation. My mind drifted to the Torah portion, the questions I wanted to raise, the stories I hoped to share. Yet, every time I tried to focus on the sermon, my thoughts snapped back to the unfinished sketch, the measurements that didn\u2019t quite add up. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014toward the quiet logic of design and the spiritual responsibility of leadership. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I stared at the blank page before me, caught between the worlds I was meant to serve."}
