The script in front of me only skimmed the surface, and I could sense the caller\u2019s impatience growing. My supervisor expected me to handle every objection, to keep the conversation going, to close the sale. But my mind kept drifting to the chapel, where the sisters were gathering for a special healing service for Sister Agnes. It was outside our usual schedule, but the Mother Superior had asked us all to attend, to pray together for her recovery. I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. My headset felt heavier with each passing second, the words of the script blurring as guilt gnawed at me. I wanted to be present for my community, to offer comfort and prayer, but I also knew my job depended on my performance. The demands of both worlds pressed in on me, and I felt myself pulled in two directions, unable to silence the ache in my chest."}
