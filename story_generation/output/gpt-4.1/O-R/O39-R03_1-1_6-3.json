The foreman had just posted a notice about an optional training session next week\u2014attendance wasn\u2019t mandatory, but everyone knew it was a chance to show commitment, to be seen as a team player. I could already feel the eyes of my coworkers, silently urging me to sign up, to prove I belonged among them.\n\nBut as I folded the notice into my pocket, the bell from the convent\u2019s chapel rang out, calling all sisters to the morning prayer. My heart tightened. The order of the day was clear: I was expected to be present, kneeling in the pews, joining my sisters in devotion. The Mother Superior always noticed absences, and prayer was the foundation of our life together.\n\nI stood at the edge of the site, torn between the dusty camaraderie of my team and the quiet sanctuary of the chapel. Both worlds demanded my presence, both held expectations I could not ignore. My hands trembled as I realized I could not be in two places at once."}
