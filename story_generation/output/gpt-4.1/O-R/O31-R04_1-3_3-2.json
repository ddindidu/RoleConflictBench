As a police officer, staying fit isn\u2019t just a personal goal\u2014it\u2019s a duty. My shift had ended, but the responsibility to protect and serve never really leaves. Just as I was about to leave, my phone buzzed. The mosque caretaker\u2019s voice was urgent: a large crowd had gathered for a special remembrance, and the scheduled imam was stuck in traffic. No one else was authorized to lead the prayer. As the community\u2019s imam, I knew they expected me to guide them, especially on such a significant night. I glanced at my gym bag, feeling the weight of my badge in one pocket and my prayer cap in the other. The gym was my commitment to the force, to being ready for any emergency. The mosque was my commitment to my faith and my community. Both needed me now, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, torn between two uniforms and the expectations stitched into each."}
