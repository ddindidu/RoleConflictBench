My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cSmile, be patient, no matter what.\u201d I force a friendly tone as I greet the next customer, who slams her groceries on the belt and complains about the wait. My heart pounds, but I keep my voice steady, apologizing and assuring her I\u2019ll be quick. \n\nInside, though, I feel a different pressure. It\u2019s almost sunset, and I haven\u2019t done my evening puja. I can\u2019t light a lamp or offer flowers here, but I try to quietly repeat my mantra between customers, hoping for a moment of peace. The store\u2019s chaos drowns out my words, and guilt creeps in\u2014am I neglecting my faith? I want to be the calm, helpful cashier everyone expects, but I also want to honor my daily rituals. The demands pull me in opposite directions, and I stand at the register, torn between the world outside and the world within."}
