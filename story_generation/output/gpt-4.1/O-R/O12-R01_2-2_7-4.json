Users were frustrated, and my manager\u2019s messages pinged with increasing urgency: \u201cWe need a fix ASAP.\u201d My mind raced through possible causes, but every solution seemed to open up another problem. Just as I was about to dive deeper, my phone buzzed. It was Sarah from church, her voice trembling. She needed to talk\u2014her family was falling apart, and she didn\u2019t know where else to turn. As her pastor, I knew she expected me to listen, to offer comfort and guidance, to be present. But the clock was ticking on the software issue, and my team was counting on me. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart ached for Sarah, but my mind kept drifting back to the code, the users, the bugs. I sat there, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
