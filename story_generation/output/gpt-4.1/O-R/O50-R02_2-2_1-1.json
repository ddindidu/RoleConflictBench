I glanced at the clock\u2014thirty minutes since the main unit had stopped, the sensor errors refusing to clear. As the only machine repairer on shift, I knew the pressure was mounting; every minute of downtime cost the factory dearly, and the supervisor\u2019s voice in my ear was tense, demanding answers. My hands itched to grab my toolkit and run to the floor, to diagnose and fix whatever was wrong.\n\nBut the church bell echoed through the window, a gentle but insistent reminder. Today was the main weekly service, the one that drew nearly everyone in the community. As their priest, I was expected to lead them in prayer, to offer comfort and guidance. They would be gathering now, waiting for me to begin. My vestments lay ready, but so did my tools. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing on my chest\u2014one demanding my technical skill, the other my spiritual presence. I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between the urgent call of machines and the quiet expectation of faith."}
