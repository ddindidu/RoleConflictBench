I was counting the cash drawer, double-checking every bill and coin, when I noticed a thick envelope left behind at the counter. Inside was a large sum of money\u2014far more than any customer had paid today. My heart pounded as I realized someone must have forgotten it. As a cashier, I knew I was expected to process every transaction accurately and report any discrepancies. If I didn\u2019t, it could mean trouble for the store and for me. But as a Christian, I felt a deep responsibility to do what was right, to be honest and return what wasn\u2019t mine. The temptation to keep the money flickered in my mind\u2014no one had seen me find it, and it would be so easy to slip it into my bag. But guilt and fear of betraying my faith gnawed at me. I stood there, the envelope heavy in my hands, torn between the demands of my job and the values I claimed to live by, unsure of what I would do next."}
