Management needed my estimates by noon, and the pressure to be precise weighed heavily on me. As an engineer, I was expected to provide accurate timelines\u2014no room for error, no excuses. My phone buzzed with reminders from my team, each message a reminder of the responsibility I carried.\n\nBut as a Hindu, I was also expected to practice my daily rituals, to honor the rhythm of my faith. Lately, I\u2019d been quietly repeating a short mantra under my breath between meetings, skipping the full morning puja. Guilt gnawed at me; the rituals were more than routine\u2014they were a grounding force, a connection to something deeper. Yet, every time I considered stepping away for even ten minutes, the thought of missing a deadline or letting my team down pulled me back.\n\nI stared at the clock, torn between the demands of my profession and the quiet call of my faith, feeling the tension build inside me as I tried to decide which expectation to honor in this moment."}
