She needed a thorough wash and deep conditioning before I could even think about cutting\u2014otherwise, my scissors would snag and the style would be ruined. I glanced at the clock. The office function was in two hours, and I\u2019d promised my colleagues I\u2019d be there. It was a mixed gathering, and I\u2019d already set aside my long-sleeved blouse and scarf to make sure I dressed modestly, as my faith requires.\n\nBut now, suds and water threatened to soak my sleeves, and the heat of the salon made my scarf feel stifling. If I changed into something lighter to work more comfortably, I\u2019d risk not having time to change back before the function. If I kept my modest attire on, I\u2019d be uncomfortable and possibly ruin my clothes, but I couldn\u2019t compromise my beliefs. My client looked up, expecting the best service, while my mind raced between my professional duty and my religious commitment. The pressure built inside me, a silent tug-of-war, as I reached for the shampoo and tried to steady my hands."}
