As a taxi driver, I felt the pressure to get him to the station on time, weaving through the city\u2019s late afternoon traffic. Every red light made my heart pound faster. But then, as we passed the church, he mentioned a story he\u2019d heard at a community gathering\u2014one I\u2019d shared as a pastor about honesty and patience. He laughed, saying, \u201cFunny how those lessons stick with you, even when you\u2019re in a rush.\u201d \n\nSuddenly, I felt the weight of both my roles. The expectation to drive quickly and get him to his train clashed with the teachings I\u2019d just been reminded of\u2014patience, trust, and not cutting corners. My hands tightened on the wheel. Should I speed up, risking safety and my own principles, or slow down and possibly make him miss his train? The city lights blurred as I wrestled with the demands of both my callings, feeling the tension coil inside me, waiting for my next move."}
