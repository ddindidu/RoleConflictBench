I stared at the chemotherapy prescription in my hand, double-checking every detail. The patient\u2019s life depended on my accuracy\u2014one decimal point off, one wrong vial, and the consequences could be catastrophic. My mind raced through calculations, cross-referencing dosages, my heart pounding with the weight of responsibility.\n\nBut tonight was also the community Quran study circle. I was expected to recite and reflect on verses I hadn\u2019t yet read, to be present in both mind and spirit. My friends would notice if I was unprepared, and I felt the pressure of not letting them down, of not letting myself down in my faith. The clock ticked closer to the study circle\u2019s start, and I felt torn\u2014my duty as a pharmacist demanded unwavering focus, while my commitment as a Muslim called me to spiritual growth and community. The two roles pulled at me, each with its own gravity, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
