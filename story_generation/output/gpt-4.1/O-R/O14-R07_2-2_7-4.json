The autoclave\u2019s pressure gauge is still acting up, and the fume hood\u2019s airflow is just below the recommended threshold. My supervisor\u2019s reminder echoes in my head: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any more safety violations.\u201d I feel the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders, knowing that even a small oversight could put the entire lab at risk.\n\nBut today is also the weekly group meditation at the temple\u2014a time I\u2019ve promised myself and my sangha to be fully present, to let go of worries and cultivate mindfulness. The thought of sitting in stillness, breathing with the community, is both a comfort and a torment. I can almost hear the gentle chime that signals the start of meditation, calling me to step away from the relentless demands of the lab.\n\nMy phone vibrates with a reminder: \u201cMeditation in 10 minutes.\u201d I stare at the equipment, then at my coat hanging by the door, torn between the urgent need to fix what\u2019s broken and the deeper need to tend to my own mind. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the impossible choice."}
