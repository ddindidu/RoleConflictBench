The law was clear\u2014client confidentiality was sacred, and my duty was to protect it at all costs. Yet, as a pastor, I was expected to be open, to teach and guide with honesty and transparency. Later that evening, at a community gathering, I found myself recounting a parable about truth and trust, my words echoing the very principles I was struggling to uphold in the courtroom. The congregation listened, expecting wisdom and clarity, but inside, I was torn. The lawyer in me clung to silence and discretion, while the pastor in me yearned to speak openly about the challenges of integrity. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding loyalty, each pulling me in a different direction. I could feel the conflict tightening in my chest, knowing that whatever I chose, a part of me would be left questioning if I had truly done the right thing."}
