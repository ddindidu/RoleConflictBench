The client would expect the house spotless for their next visit, but I knew there wouldn\u2019t be enough cleaner left. I made a mental note to remind them or pick some up myself, but my shift was ending and I had to hurry to the church. As I was locking up, my phone buzzed\u2014a parishioner, asking if I might have time to talk soon. She didn\u2019t sound urgent, but I knew from experience that sometimes a simple inquiry masked deeper needs. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: the client\u2019s expectation for a perfectly maintained home, and the parishioner\u2019s hope for spiritual support. I couldn\u2019t ignore either, but there was only so much of me to go around. My mind raced, torn between running to the store for cleaning supplies and calling the parishioner back right away. I stood in the doorway, keys in hand, heart pounding, caught between the demands of spotless floors and a soul in quiet distress."}
