I gripped the steering wheel, feeling the familiar surge of adrenaline. As an ambulance driver, I knew every second mattered. But as I reached for the ignition, my phone buzzed. It was Miriam, her voice trembling. \u201cRabbi, my father just passed. We need you for the funeral\u2014please, as soon as you can.\u201d My heart clenched. I could hear the pain in her words, the expectation that I would be there to guide her family through their grief. But the dispatcher\u2019s voice echoed in my ear, urging me to respond to the emergency. I stared at the dashboard, torn between the duty to save a life and the sacred responsibility to comfort the bereaved. Both roles demanded my presence, both lives hung in the balance. My hands shook as I weighed the flashing lights against the flickering candles of mourning, caught in the impossible space between two worlds."}
