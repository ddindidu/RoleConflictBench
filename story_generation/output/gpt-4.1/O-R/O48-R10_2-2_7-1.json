It was almost time for my evening prayers, the moment I set aside each day to light a lamp and offer gratitude at my home altar. My faith was my anchor, and these rituals brought me peace. But as I turned to leave the patient\u2019s room, I saw Mrs. Patel\u2019s eyes fill with tears. She had just come out of surgery and looked so small and frightened in her hospital bed. I knew she needed someone to sit with her, to hold her hand and reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone. My supervisor always said that emotional support was as important as any medication. Yet, my mind kept drifting to my home, to the quiet corner where my lamp waited to be lit. I felt torn\u2014my heart aching for Mrs. Patel, but also for the sacred time I owed to my faith. The minutes ticked by, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
