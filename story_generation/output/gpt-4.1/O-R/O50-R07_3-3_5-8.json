I knew what it meant: if I didn\u2019t act now, the whole line could grind to a halt, costing hours and maybe jobs. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014machines must be maintained, cleaned, kept running at all costs. I reached for my tools, but my phone buzzed. A message from my teacher: \u201cPlease prepare the summary for tomorrow\u2019s session. The sangha is counting on your insight.\u201d I stared at the screen, heart pounding. The teachings on mindfulness and detachment, the hours I\u2019d planned to spend in quiet study tonight, all seemed to slip away beneath the weight of metal and oil. I felt torn, the demands of the world and the path pulling me in opposite directions. My hands trembled, caught between the wrench and the sutra, between the screeching machine and the silent call of the Dharma."}
