As an architect, I prided myself on designing spaces that made people\u2019s work lives easier. My manager expected me to present the plan at the afternoon function, where I\u2019d need to answer questions and mingle with colleagues from every department. I glanced at the invitation again\u2014business casual, it said, and I knew from past events that most women wore fitted dresses or skirts. \n\nAs a Muslim, I always dressed modestly, covering my arms and legs, and wearing a loose scarf. But I remembered the last time I wore my usual attire to a similar event; a few colleagues had stared, and one even asked if I was feeling too warm. I felt the pressure to blend in, to look \u201cprofessional\u201d by their standards, but I also felt the weight of my faith and the comfort of my identity. \n\nNow, as the clock ticked closer to the function, I stared at my wardrobe, torn between the expectations of my profession and the principles of my faith, my heart pounding with uncertainty."}
