She tried to smile, but her eyes darted anxiously to the coppery highlights that were a shade too bold. My training as a hairdresser told me to address her disappointment immediately, to listen, reassure, and offer a solution. But my mind kept drifting to the convent, where the Mother Superior had just entrusted me with leading daily reflections for the retreat. I was supposed to be preparing, reading scripture, and meditating, not mixing dyes and fielding complaints. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014one demanding my full attention to a client\u2019s needs, the other expecting spiritual leadership and presence. I could feel the minutes slipping away, each one a tug-of-war between the salon\u2019s bright lights and the quiet chapel\u2019s call. My client\u2019s voice broke through my thoughts, soft but uncertain: \u201cIs it supposed to look like this?\u201d I swallowed, torn between the urge to fix her hair and the guilt of neglecting my spiritual duties, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to either."}
