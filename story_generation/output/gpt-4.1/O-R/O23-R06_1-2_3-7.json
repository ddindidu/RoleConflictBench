It was a minor matter, one that could easily be postponed if I requested it. As I organized my notes, my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a friend from church. Her brother had been in an accident, and she was overwhelmed, asking if I could come sit with her at the hospital. My mind raced. As a lawyer, I was expected to represent my client in court, to be present and prepared, even for small hearings. But as a Christian, I felt a deep pull to show love and kindness, to be there for Sarah in her time of need, just as Jesus would have wanted. The expectations pressed in from both sides, each demanding my presence, each feeling urgent in its own way. I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, torn between my professional duty and my calling to care for others, unsure which path to take."}
