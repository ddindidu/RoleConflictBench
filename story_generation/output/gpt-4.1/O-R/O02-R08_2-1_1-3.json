The project manager\u2019s email blinked on my screen: \u201cWe need a working prototype by tomorrow. Stakeholders want to see progress before they approve funding.\u201d My mind raced with technical possibilities, but I was still in my pajamas\u2014loose and comfortable, perfect for a day at home with my family. I hadn\u2019t planned to see anyone outside, so I hadn\u2019t changed into my usual modest attire. \n\nBut then, a video call notification popped up. The team wanted to discuss the prototype, and the stakeholders might join. I felt a knot in my stomach. As an engineer, I was expected to be ready, professional, and responsive, especially now. But as a Muslim, I was also expected to dress modestly, even in virtual meetings, out of respect for my values. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. Should I rush to change, risking being late and unprepared, or join as I was, compromising my beliefs? My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
