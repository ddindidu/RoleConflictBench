As a lifeguard, I knew the stakes\u2014one slip, one second of distraction, and someone could be swept away by the high tide. My whistle hung heavy around my neck, a constant reminder of my duty to protect every swimmer. But my phone buzzed with a message from the synagogue: the children\u2019s lesson was in an hour, and they still hadn\u2019t learned the blessings for the upcoming holiday. As a Jew, I felt the weight of tradition pressing on me, the responsibility to pass on our values and history. I pictured the eager faces of the kids, waiting for me to guide them. My heart pounded with the pressure of both worlds\u2014one demanding my unwavering vigilance, the other my nurturing presence. I stood at the edge of the water, torn, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
