The living room still needed vacuuming, and the bathroom mirror was streaked with toothpaste. My supervisor had reminded me this morning: \u201cWe need the common areas spotless for the inspection.\u201d I knew I\u2019d only managed a quick tidy-up so far, and the standards were high. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the conversion candidate\u2019s final study session. She was nervous, her Beit Din interview tomorrow would decide her future in our community. As her rabbi, I was expected to guide her through the last, crucial questions of Jewish law, to offer reassurance and wisdom. My heart pounded. If I left now, the cleaning would be half-done, risking my job and letting down my coworkers. If I stayed, I\u2019d fail someone who trusted me with her spiritual journey. The mop felt heavy in my hand as I stood in the hallway, torn between the demands of two worlds, each expecting my full devotion."}
