I\u2019ve been with your company for years, but this sounds fishy.\u201d My script fluttered in my hand, but I knew it wouldn\u2019t help. As a telemarketer, I was expected to stay calm, answer every objection, and keep him on the line. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t let them hang up. Address every concern.\u201d \n\nBut my phone buzzed with a message from Farid, a gentle soul from my mosque. \u201cImam, if you have a moment, I could use your advice,\u201d he\u2019d written earlier. I\u2019d promised to be available, to offer guidance whenever needed. The weight of his trust pressed on me. \n\nNow, caught between the demands of my job and the needs of my community, my heart pounded. Mr. Rahman\u2019s frustration grew, and Farid\u2019s quiet plea lingered. I felt torn, the expectations of both worlds pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which voice to answer first."}
