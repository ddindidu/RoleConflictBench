My phone buzzes with messages from the team: \u201cAny update?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re blocked until your part is done.\u201d The pressure is mounting; the project manager\u2019s voice echoes in my mind, reminding me of deadlines and dependencies. As the engineer, I know everyone is waiting on me. The build can\u2019t move forward until I deliver.\n\nBut then, the gentle chime of my meditation app sounds. It\u2019s time for our planned ten-minute window of mindfulness, a commitment I made to myself and my sangha. As a Buddhist, I promised to honor this space, to step away from the rush and cultivate presence. My mind is torn\u2014one part pulled by the urgent demands of the project, the other yearning for stillness and self-compassion. My hands hover over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I wrestle with the weight of both expectations, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing second."}
