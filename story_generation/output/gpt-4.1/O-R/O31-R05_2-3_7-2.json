As a police officer, I was expected to remain calm, impartial, and fair, gathering statements and evidence to resolve the dispute with integrity. My radio crackled with updates, but my mind was elsewhere. Tonight was the High Holiday service, and as the rabbi, I was responsible for delivering a sermon that would guide and inspire my congregation. They were counting on me to be present, to offer wisdom and comfort during this sacred time. The clock on my wrist ticked louder with every passing minute. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014my badge and my tallit\u2014pressing on my shoulders. If I rushed the accident investigation, I\u2019d betray my duty as an officer. If I stayed too long, I\u2019d let down my community as their rabbi. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, torn between two worlds that both demanded my full devotion."}
