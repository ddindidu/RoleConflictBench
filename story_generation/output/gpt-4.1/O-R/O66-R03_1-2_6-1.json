As a taxi driver, I prided myself on keeping my car spotless\u2014my passengers expected nothing less. The city was busy tonight, and I knew I\u2019d have a steady stream of fares. But as I finished tidying up, my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes: the family next door had lost everything in a fire. They needed food, clothes, comfort\u2014immediate help. My heart ached for them. As a nun, I was expected to be there, to serve, to offer compassion and practical aid. Yet, I glanced at the clock. My shift was about to start, and I couldn\u2019t afford to lose tonight\u2019s earnings. My cab was ready, my uniform crisp, but my mind was torn. Should I lock up and rush to the family\u2019s side, or slide behind the wheel and fulfill my duty to my passengers? The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, and I stood frozen, keys in hand, caught between two worlds that needed me."}
