My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cAlways be polite, always be professional.\u201d I could hear the irritation in the customer\u2019s voice, and I struggled to keep my own tone calm, even as I realized the package had been misplaced. At that moment, my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been having a hard time lately, and she was reaching out for comfort. As a pastor, I knew I should respond with empathy, offer her the spiritual guidance she needed. But the customer was still waiting for answers, and I felt the pressure to resolve the delivery issue quickly and courteously. My heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the duty of my job and the calling of my faith. I stared at my phone, torn between the expectations of professionalism and compassion, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
