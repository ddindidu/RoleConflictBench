It was thick, stuffed with cash and cards. My supervisor always reminded us to focus on speed and surface tidiness\u2014just a quick sweep, wipe, and move on. We weren\u2019t expected to dig deep or spend extra time searching for lost items. But as a Christian, I knew honesty and integrity were non-negotiable. My heart pounded as I stared at the wallet. If I turned it in, I\u2019d fall behind on my cleaning schedule, maybe even get a warning for not meeting the day\u2019s quota. If I left it, someone else might take it, or the owner might never find it. The pressure of my job\u2019s expectations pressed against the quiet voice of my faith, and I stood frozen, wrestling with what to do next."}
