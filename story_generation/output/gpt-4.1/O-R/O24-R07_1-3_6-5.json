As a judge, I know I must stay current, and the pressure to be informed weighs on me\u2014my colleagues expect sharp analysis, and my rulings must reflect the latest precedents. Yet, the clock reminds me that the weekly group meditation is about to begin. As the leader, my sangha relies on me to guide them in mindfulness, to be present and centered, not distracted by worldly concerns. I feel the tug of both worlds: the intellectual rigor of the law and the gentle discipline of Buddhist practice. My mind races with legal arguments, but my heart yearns for stillness. I imagine the group waiting, expecting calm guidance, while the journal\u2019s articles whisper of professional duty. The demands pull at me, each urgent in its own way, and I sit at my desk, torn, the weight of expectation pressing from both sides."}
