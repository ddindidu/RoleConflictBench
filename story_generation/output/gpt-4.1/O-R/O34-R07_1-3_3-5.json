A pilot\u2019s voice crackles through: \u201cRequesting altimeter setting.\u201d My fingers hover over the console, ready to respond, but my eyes flick to the clock. The weekly meditation group begins in five minutes, and I am supposed to guide everyone into stillness, to embody calm and presence. My mind splits\u2014one part tethered to the sky, responsible for the safety of hundreds, the other yearning for the quiet sanctuary of the meditation hall below. The expectation to be alert, precise, and responsive as an air traffic controller clashes with the call to be serene, undistracted, and fully present as a Buddhist leader. I feel the tension coil in my chest, the weight of responsibility on both sides. The pilot waits for my reply, and I sense the group gathering, expecting my guidance. My breath falters, caught between the demands of the air and the silence of the cushion, uncertain which world I can truly serve in this moment."}
