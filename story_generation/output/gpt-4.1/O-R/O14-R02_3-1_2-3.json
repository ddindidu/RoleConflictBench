The data I could gather tonight might finally validate my hypothesis\u2014just in time for the funding review that could make or break my research. My phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from Anna, a parishioner. She asks if I might have time to talk, not now, but sometime soon. Her words are gentle, but I sense a quiet urgency beneath them. As a priest, I know the importance of being present, of offering guidance when someone reaches out, even tentatively. Yet, as a scientist, I feel the weight of the experiment pressing down on me, the expectation to seize this fleeting opportunity. My heart aches with the tension\u2014torn between the call of discovery and the call of compassion. I stare at the blinking cursor on my phone, paralyzed, knowing that whatever I choose, something vital will be left waiting."}
