As a lifeguard, I knew my duty: unwavering vigilance, every swimmer\u2019s safety in my hands. A few kids drifted toward the deep end, but they seemed fine, laughing and splashing. Still, I couldn\u2019t let my focus slip. Yet, in my bag beside me, the Buddhist texts called out. My teacher had asked me to summarize the Four Noble Truths for tomorrow\u2019s temple session\u2014a rare honor, and a responsibility I took to heart. I felt the urge to open the book, to jot down insights while the pool was calm. But the lifeguard in me recoiled at the thought. What if, in those moments of reflection, someone needed me? My mind tugged in two directions: the discipline of watchfulness, the pull of spiritual study. I gripped the whistle tighter, heart pounding, caught between the world\u2019s demands and the path of inner peace, uncertain which voice to heed."}
