The brake system warning was unmistakable\u2014protocol demanded I report it and halt the train immediately. My passengers\u2019 safety depended on my swift, calm action. But as the train rumbled through the tunnel, my phone vibrated with a message from the mosque committee: the congregation was gathering, the mosque already full. Today was not just any Friday; it was the anniversary of our community\u2019s founding, and people had come from distant towns to hear my sermon. I was their imam, their guide, and they expected me to stand before them, to offer words of unity and hope. My mind raced, torn between the duty to protect those in my care on the train and the responsibility to lead my community in a moment that would not come again. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, and I felt the impossible pull of two worlds, each demanding all of me, right now."}
