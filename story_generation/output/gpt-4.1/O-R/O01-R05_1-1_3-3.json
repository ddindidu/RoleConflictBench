The space was tight, and I focused on making every inch functional\u2014storage tucked under the window, a fold-out desk, shelves just high enough to reach. My mind was deep in measurements and materials when my phone buzzed. A reminder: the adult education class at the synagogue was starting in an hour. It was an optional, drop-in session, but I knew some regulars counted on me to guide them through the week\u2019s Torah portion, to answer their questions about Jewish law. \n\nAs an architect, I felt the pressure to finish the plans before the contractor\u2019s deadline. As a rabbi, I felt the pull of my community\u2019s expectations, the responsibility to teach and be present. My heart twisted with guilt\u2014if I stayed, I\u2019d let down those seeking spiritual guidance; if I left, I\u2019d risk delaying the renovation and disappointing my client. I stared at the half-finished sketch, the clock ticking louder, torn between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which demand to answer first."}
