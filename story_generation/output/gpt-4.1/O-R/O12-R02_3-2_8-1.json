My heart sank when I saw the message: production outage, users locked out, urgent fix needed. I knew immediately it was the bug I\u2019d been chasing all week, the one I\u2019d promised to resolve. My inbox was already filling with frantic messages from the QA team and customer support. At the same time, the church bell tolled, echoing through the hallways, and I could hear the congregation gathering, waiting for me to lead them in prayer. I felt the weight of their expectation\u2014this service was the spiritual anchor for so many, and my absence would be noticed, even felt as a betrayal. Yet, the company depended on me too; every minute the system was down, more customers lost trust. My mind raced, torn between the urgent call of my profession and the sacred duty of my faith. I stood frozen, laptop in one hand, prayer book in the other, caught in the impossible space between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
