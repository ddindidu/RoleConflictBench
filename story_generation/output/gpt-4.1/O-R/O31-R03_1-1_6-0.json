The driver, Mrs. Alvarez, was inside, hurriedly buying bread for the shelter\u2019s food drive\u2014our food drive. As a police officer, I was expected to uphold the law with integrity, treating everyone fairly, no matter how small the infraction. But as a nun, I was supposed to be at the convent right now, helping prepare meals for the homeless, showing compassion and mercy. My radio crackled with a reminder about the food drive, and I glanced at the time. If I wrote the ticket, I\u2019d be late to serve those who needed me most. If I let it go, was I betraying my duty as an officer? My heart pounded as I weighed the badge on my chest against the habit I wore beneath my uniform, torn between justice and mercy, between the law and love."}
