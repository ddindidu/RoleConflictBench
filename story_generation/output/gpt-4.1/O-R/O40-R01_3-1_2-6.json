As a carpenter, I know the importance of safety\u2014one loose blade or frayed cord could mean disaster. I laid out my equipment, checking each piece, but my mind wandered to the community gathering scheduled for later. As the town\u2019s pastor, I was expected to share a story that would inspire and guide, weaving in the principles of our faith. \n\nWhile tightening a bolt on the circular saw, I rehearsed the parable I planned to tell, but the foreman called out, \u201cWe\u2019re behind schedule. Can you skip the checks and get started?\u201d My hands hesitated. The crew trusted me to keep them safe, but the congregation expected me to be present and prepared, not distracted by work. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding vigilance and caution, the other calling for spiritual leadership and focus. I stood there, torn, the hum of the jobsite and the echo of scripture both vying for my attention, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
