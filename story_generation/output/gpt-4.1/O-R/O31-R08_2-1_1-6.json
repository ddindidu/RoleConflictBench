My radio crackled with urgent voices\u2014orders to keep the peace, to step in if things turned violent. As a police officer, I was expected to be calm, decisive, and ready to act, no matter the personal cost. But as I watched the protest swell, my mind wandered to my faith. I had always dreamed of performing Hajj, fulfilling that sacred pillar of Islam. Yet, with my modest salary and the demands of this job, saving enough for the pilgrimage felt impossible. My family and community reminded me of its importance, their expectations heavy on my shoulders. Now, as the tension in the street mounted, I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to uphold the law, and my longing to fulfill a spiritual obligation I feared I might never reach. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
