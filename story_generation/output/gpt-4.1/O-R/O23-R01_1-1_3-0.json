A procedural hearing for a client was set for noon\u2014a minor matter, one that could easily be postponed with a quick call. As I weighed my options, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mary, a member of my congregation. Her husband had just been rushed to the hospital, and she was asking if I could come pray with her. I could almost hear the tremor in her voice, the desperate need for comfort. As a lawyer, I knew my client expected me to be present, to represent them with diligence, even if the hearing was routine. As a pastor, I felt the pull to be by Mary\u2019s side, to offer the spiritual guidance she sought in her darkest hour. The expectations pressed in from both sides, each demanding my presence, my care, my responsibility. I sat there, torn, the weight of both roles heavy on my shoulders, uncertain which path to take."}
