The synagogue service starts in less than an hour, and tonight I\u2019m supposed to chant a portion\u2014something I\u2019ve practiced for weeks. It\u2019s not just a duty; it\u2019s a promise to my community and to myself. But here, in the quiet of the hospital room, Mrs. Goldstein winces as she tries to lift her spoon. Her pain is obvious, her hands trembling. I know she needs help, and as a nursing assistant, it\u2019s my job to make sure she eats, to ease her discomfort, to be present for her in this moment. Yet, the minutes slip away, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My supervisor expects me to stay until my shift ends, and my faith calls me to the synagogue. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the guilt gnaws at me\u2014toward my patient, toward my community, and toward myself. I stand frozen, torn between the call of compassion and the call of tradition, unsure which path to take."}
