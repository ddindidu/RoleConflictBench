The production line had been down for half an hour, and the supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford more delays\u2014find the fault, fast.\u201d My hands moved automatically, opening the sensor housing, but my mind was elsewhere. Today was my cousin\u2019s wedding ceremony, and my family expected me to arrive soon, dressed in my best kurta, to join the prayers and rituals. My mother had called twice already, her voice gentle but insistent: \u201cDon\u2019t be late, beta. Everyone is waiting for you.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on my chest\u2014the responsibility to get the machines running, the duty to honor my family and faith.
