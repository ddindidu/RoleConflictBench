Fever, joint pain, a rash\u2014none of it fit neatly into any diagnosis I knew. As a doctor, I felt the weight of responsibility pressing on me; my patient\u2019s health depended on my ability to piece together these clues and act quickly. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, my heart pounded for another reason. Today was not just any Friday\u2014it was the day our community celebrated a milestone, and I, as the imam, was expected to deliver the sermon. People had travelled from distant towns, eager to hear words of guidance and hope. My phone buzzed with reminders from the mosque committee, their expectations clear. Torn between the urgent needs of my patient and the spiritual needs of my community, I felt a knot tighten in my chest. Both roles demanded my presence, my focus, my care. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice before me, knowing that whatever I decided, someone would be left waiting."}
