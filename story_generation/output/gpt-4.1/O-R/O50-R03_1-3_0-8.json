The old packaging machine, silent for months, had started acting up just as the factory slowed for the season. My supervisor expected me to find the cause\u2014quickly\u2014before the next production run. I knelt beside the humming machine, tools in hand, mind racing through possible faults. But my thoughts kept drifting to the chapel, where the Mother Superior had entrusted me with leading daily reflections for the retreat. She believed my words could guide the sisters, and I felt the weight of her faith in me. Yet, every hour spent diagnosing circuits and sensors was an hour lost from prayer and preparation. I felt torn, pulled between the urgent demands of the factory floor and the quiet call of spiritual leadership. My hands trembled, unsure whether to reach for the wrench or the worn pages of scripture, as the pressure from both worlds pressed in on me."}
