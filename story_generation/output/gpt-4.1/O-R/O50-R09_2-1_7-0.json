My job as a machine repairer wasn\u2019t just to fix breakdowns, but to guide clients so these mistakes didn\u2019t keep happening. Each time he made an adjustment, I saw more material wasted, and I knew I needed to step in, explain the process, and help him understand the right way. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the weekly study session I\u2019d planned for the kids at the synagogue. Teaching them about our traditions, sharing stories of our people, was something I cherished and felt responsible for. I could shift the lesson, but I\u2019d promised the parents consistency, and the kids looked forward to it. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the expectation to be present and helpful here, and the commitment to nurture the next generation in our faith. My mind raced, torn between the immediate need on the shop floor and the quiet, steady pull of my community."}
