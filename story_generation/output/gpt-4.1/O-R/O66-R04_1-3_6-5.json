As a taxi driver, I prided myself on keeping my cab spotless\u2014my regulars expected nothing less. Just as I finished, my phone buzzed. It was the mosque committee: \u201cWe\u2019re counting on you for the Friday sermon. People are coming from out of town to hear you.\u201d My heart tightened. I glanced at the clock. If I took one more fare, I\u2019d barely have time to change and reach the mosque. But the streets were busy, and a family with luggage waved me down, desperate for a ride to the train station. I knew they relied on me for a clean, comfortable journey. Yet, my congregation was waiting, expecting guidance and inspiration on this important day. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my duty to serve my passengers with professionalism, and my responsibility as an imam to lead my community. I stood by my cab, keys in hand, torn between two worlds, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
