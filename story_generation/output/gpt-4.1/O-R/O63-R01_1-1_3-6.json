My sales numbers blinked on the screen\u2014already ahead of target, my manager\u2019s praise still echoing from this morning. \u201cKeep it up, push for more,\u201d he\u2019d said. The pressure to keep climbing, to not let up, was a constant thrum in my chest. Later, at the community center, I slipped into my other role. As a pastor, I shared a story from scripture, hoping to inspire kindness and honesty. The group listened, nodding, some faces softening with understanding. But as I spoke, my mind flickered back to the calls I\u2019d made\u2014how I\u2019d nudged hesitant voices toward a sale, glossed over details to close the deal. The expectation to teach truth and compassion clashed with the tactics I used to meet quotas. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, the demands of my job and my calling pulling me in opposite directions. My heart pounded as I wondered which voice I should listen to."}
