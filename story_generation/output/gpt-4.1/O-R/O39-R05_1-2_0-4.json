My supervisor called out, \u201cHey, before you clock out, move those bricks to the back lot, alright? Needs to be done today.\u201d I nodded, feeling the ache in my arms, but knowing the job had to be finished. As I glanced at my watch, my heart tightened. In less than an hour, I was supposed to be at the synagogue, leading the children\u2019s Torah class. The parents expected me to be there, to guide their kids, to answer their questions about faith and tradition. I could already picture their eager faces, waiting for stories and lessons. But here I was, boots caked in dust, with a pile of bricks that wouldn\u2019t move themselves. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014one demanding my strength and sweat, the other my wisdom and presence. I stood between the stacks of materials and the distant sound of children\u2019s laughter, torn by the impossible pull of duty."}
