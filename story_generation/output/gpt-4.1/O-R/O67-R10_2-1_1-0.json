As an ambulance driver, I\u2019m expected to reach every emergency as fast as possible, no matter the traffic or time of day. But as I flicked on the siren and merged into the slow-moving city traffic, my mind drifted to my other role\u2014my faith. I hadn\u2019t performed my full morning puja, only whispered a quick mantra under my breath before my shift. Guilt tugged at me; my family and community expect me to honor my daily rituals, to keep my spiritual discipline strong. Yet here I was, torn between the duty to save a stranger and the duty to honor my beliefs. The ambulance inched forward, my heart pounding with the weight of both expectations, wondering if I was failing at both."}
