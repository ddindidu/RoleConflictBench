As a judge, I was expected to write a clear, detailed judgment within thirty days\u2014every fact, every legal nuance weighed and explained. The parties deserved closure, and the law demanded precision. Yet, as a pastor, I had promised my congregation an intensive workshop for our community leaders, delving into challenging theological concepts. They looked to me for guidance, for clarity in faith, and I knew how much this meant to them. Each role pulled at me with its own urgency: the law\u2019s demand for order and justice, the church\u2019s need for spiritual growth. My mind raced with legal arguments while my heart yearned to prepare lessons that would inspire. I felt the weight of both callings pressing in, the expectations of the court and the congregation colliding within me. I stared at the blank page, torn, knowing I could not give both my full devotion at once."}
