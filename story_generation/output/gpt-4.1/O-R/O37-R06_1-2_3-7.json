The shelves were running low\u2014barely enough detergent and sponges to last the week. My supervisor had made it clear: no supplies, no cleaning, and no cleaning meant trouble for me. I felt the pressure to keep everything stocked and organized, to make sure the household ran smoothly.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. A message from Maria, a friend from church, flashed on the screen. She\u2019d lost her job and was struggling to make ends meet. She asked if I had any extra cleaning supplies she could borrow, just until she got back on her feet. My heart ached for her. As a Christian, I knew I was called to show love and kindness, to help those in need, just as Jesus taught. But if I gave her what she needed, I\u2019d be short on supplies for work, risking my job and disappointing my employer. I stood in the supply closet, torn between my duty as a cleaner and my calling as a Christian, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me."}
