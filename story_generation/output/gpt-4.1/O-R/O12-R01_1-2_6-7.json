The QA team flagged a minor UI glitch\u2014nothing catastrophic, just a button that sometimes shifted out of place. Users could still complete their tasks, and there was a simple workaround, but the expectation was clear: I was supposed to fix it, ideally before the next release. My manager\u2019s message was polite but firm, reminding me of our commitment to quality.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. Sunday was approaching, and I hadn\u2019t finished preparing my sermon. The congregation expected guidance, clarity, and inspiration. I wanted to offer them something meaningful, something that would help them navigate their own moral crossroads. My notes were scattered, my thoughts unfocused.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions\u2014one world demanding technical precision, the other spiritual wisdom. If I focused on the bug, I\u2019d risk offering a half-formed message to my church. If I poured myself into the sermon, I\u2019d let my team down. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, wrestling with which part of myself to disappoint."}
