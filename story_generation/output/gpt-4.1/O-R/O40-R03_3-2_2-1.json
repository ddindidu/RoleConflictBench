As a carpenter, I knew the importance of inspecting every saw, every drill, before starting the day\u2019s structural work. Safety protocols weren\u2019t just rules\u2014they were lifelines, and I owed it to myself and my coworkers to make sure everything was in order. But as I reached for the oil can, Sister Maria burst in, her face pale with urgency. \u201cThe Johnsons\u2019 house burned down last night,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have nothing. We\u2019re gathering food and clothes for them now. Can you help?\u201d\n\nMy heart twisted. As a nun, compassion and service were at the core of my vows. The community expected me to be there, to offer comfort and aid in times of crisis. But the tools before me demanded my attention, too\u2014if I neglected them, someone could get hurt. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each too important to ignore. My mind raced, caught between the call of duty and the call of compassion, unsure which path to take first."}
