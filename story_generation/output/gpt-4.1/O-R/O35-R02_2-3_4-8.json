My training as an operator kicked in: I needed to ensure everyone\u2019s safety, follow protocol, and possibly evacuate the train. My heart pounded, but I kept my voice steady as I made the announcement, watching the passengers\u2019 faces for signs of panic. At that moment, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was the mother of one of my parish children, her message urgent: their family needed me to lead a final preparation session for their child\u2019s sacrament, scheduled for that very afternoon. They\u2019d been waiting weeks, and this was the last chance before the ceremony. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me\u2014the operator\u2019s cap and the priest\u2019s collar. My congregation expected guidance and presence; my passengers expected calm and decisive action. I stood in the operator\u2019s booth, torn between the emergency unfolding on the train and the sacred promise I\u2019d made to my parishioners, my mind racing as I tried to decide where my duty lay."}
