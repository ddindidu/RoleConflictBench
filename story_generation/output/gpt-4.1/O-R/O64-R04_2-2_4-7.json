She clutched a blender, no receipt in sight. \u201cPlease, I need to return this. It\u2019s broken, and I can\u2019t afford another.\u201d My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cNo returns without a receipt, no exceptions.\u201d As a cashier, I was expected to enforce the rules, keep the line moving, and avoid personal involvement. But as an imam, I was called to show compassion, to listen, to help those in distress. Just this morning, Mrs. Rahman had messaged me, asking for a private meeting about her family\u2019s troubles. Now, here she was, seeking help in a different form, her need written all over her face. My hands hesitated over the register keys. The line behind her grew, impatient. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the demands of my two worlds\u2014one asking for strict adherence to policy, the other for mercy and understanding."}
