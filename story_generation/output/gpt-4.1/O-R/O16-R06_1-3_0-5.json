I had promised the pastor I would help set up for the service and lead the prayer group, something I hadn\u2019t missed in years. But just as I was about to leave, a patient walked in\u2014an elderly woman, coughing and sniffling, her eyes watery. She apologized for coming without an appointment, but she was worried her cold might be something worse. As a doctor, I knew I couldn\u2019t just send her away. My duty was to listen, examine, and make sure she was truly okay. Yet, as I sat her down and began to take her history, my phone buzzed with messages from church friends asking where I was. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the expectation to serve my patient with undivided attention, and the pull of my faith community, waiting for me to fulfill my spiritual commitments. My heart pounded as I tried to focus, torn between the needs of the woman before me and the promises I\u2019d made to my church."}
