My script only skimmed the surface, and I fumbled for answers, feeling the pressure to keep the call on track and close the sale. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cHandle objections, don\u2019t let them slip away.\u201d But my mind kept drifting to the appointment I had scheduled for later that afternoon\u2014a parishioner, desperate for guidance, who had confided in me about a struggle that weighed heavily on their soul.\n\nThe clock ticked down the minutes. I was expected to be calm, patient, and knowledgeable here, but soon I\u2019d need to be compassionate, present, and wise. The demands pulled at me from both sides. Could I really offer comfort and spiritual counsel after a morning spent deflecting objections and pushing a product I barely understood?
