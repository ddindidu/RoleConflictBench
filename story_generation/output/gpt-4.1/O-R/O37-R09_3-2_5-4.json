The client\u2019s instructions were clear: use only this product for the marble floors, nothing else. I was supposed to keep track of supplies, but I hadn\u2019t noticed how low we were. The nearest store that carried it was a half-hour away, and I only had a short break before my next task. My stomach rumbled, reminding me I hadn\u2019t eaten since early morning. I\u2019d planned to grab lunch at the kosher vendor nearby\u2014my only reliable option when working in this part of town. If I went to the store, I\u2019d miss my chance to eat kosher before my shift ended. If I stopped for lunch, I\u2019d let my client down and risk their trust. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: the expectation to be a responsible, attentive cleaner, and my commitment to keeping kosher, a core part of my identity. My mind raced, torn between the demands of my job and my faith, unsure which responsibility I could bear to set aside."}
