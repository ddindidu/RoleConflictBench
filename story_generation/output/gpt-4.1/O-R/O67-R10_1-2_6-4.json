The city was busy, and I reminded myself that even without a patient inside, I had to follow every rule\u2014no shortcuts, no rushing. As I waited at a red light, I saw a commotion on the sidewalk. My friend Ravi was being shouted at by a group of men, their words sharp and unfair. I could see the distress on his face, and my heart twisted. As a Hindu, I believe in standing up for what is right, in protecting others from injustice. My mind raced\u2014should I stop the ambulance and help Ravi, fulfilling my moral duty? Or should I keep driving, honoring my responsibility to the job and the safety of the vehicle? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I felt torn, caught between the expectations of my faith and my duty as an ambulance driver."}
