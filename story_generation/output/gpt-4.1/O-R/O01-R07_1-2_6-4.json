The construction team\u2019s update is late, and the client expects a progress report by tomorrow morning. As an architect, I\u2019m supposed to keep everything on track, anticipate delays, and respond quickly. My phone buzzes\u2014a reminder for the weekly group meditation at the temple, starting in fifteen minutes. As a Buddhist, I value this hour of mindfulness, the quiet space to breathe and let go. But my mind is tangled in blueprints and deadlines. If I leave now, I risk missing a crucial call from the site manager. If I stay, I\u2019ll break my commitment to the sangha and to myself. My chest tightens as I weigh the demands: efficiency and presence, responsibility and peace. The cursor blinks on the screen, waiting for my next move, while the temple bell in my memory calls me to stillness."}
