As a lawyer, I was preparing for a high-stakes jury trial that would begin tomorrow\u2014one that had already been postponed twice. My client\u2019s future, and a substantial sum of money, hung in the balance. The judge had made it clear: no more delays. Every moment, I reviewed evidence, rehearsed arguments, and anticipated the opposing counsel\u2019s moves.\n\nBut as the sun dipped below the horizon, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee. The regular backup imam was out of town, and the congregation was counting on me to lead the evening prayers. I knew how much the community valued my presence, especially during these uncertain times. They needed guidance, comfort, and a familiar voice.\n\nMy heart pounded as I stared at my calendar, the trial and prayer times overlapping.
