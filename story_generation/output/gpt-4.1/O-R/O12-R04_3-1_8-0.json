The production system was down\u2014users locked out, support tickets piling up, and the outage traced directly to a bug in my code. My team needed me to jump on a call, troubleshoot, and fix it before the business day began. At the same time, the clock ticked closer to prayer. As the imam, I was expected to lead, to be present and calm for the small congregation that gathered every morning. I knew another worshipper could step in, but I also knew the community valued my presence, my voice, my guidance. My laptop sat open on the desk, error logs scrolling by, while my prayer robe hung ready by the door. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my team\u2019s urgent need for a solution, my congregation\u2019s quiet expectation for spiritual leadership. My heart pounded as I stood between the two, torn by the demands of code and community, unsure which door to walk through."}
