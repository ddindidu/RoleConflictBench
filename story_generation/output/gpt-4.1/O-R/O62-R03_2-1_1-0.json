The sun was hot, and the kids were loud, but my focus never wavered. As a lifeguard, I knew every second counted. Suddenly, I noticed a boy in the middle of the pool, his strokes faltering, head bobbing awkwardly. My muscles tensed, ready to leap in if he slipped under. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from the convent. Today was the monthly food drive, and I was expected to help prepare and distribute meals for the homeless. Sister Maria\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe must serve with our hands and our hearts.\u201d Guilt gnawed at me. The sisters were counting on me, and the people at the shelter needed every helping hand. But here, at the pool, these swimmers depended on my vigilance. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me as I watched the struggling boy and thought of the hungry waiting at the convent."}
