The homeowner\u2019s anxious eyes followed my every move. \u201cWe need this fixed before the weekend,\u201d she pleaded, her voice trembling. The termites had done their work well, and the structure was unsafe. As a carpenter, I knew the urgency\u2014lives could be at risk if I delayed. I promised her a repair plan by the end of the day.\n\nBut as I left, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was the sole imam for tomorrow\u2019s Friday prayer. The community had already shared the sermon topic, and people were expecting guidance and inspiration. There was no one else to step in; the congregation would be waiting for me, looking for answers, for comfort.\n\nMy mind raced, torn between the weight of two responsibilities. The tools in my truck felt heavier than usual, and my heart pounded with the pressure of letting someone down\u2014either the family who needed safety or the community who needed faith. I sat in my car, hands gripping the wheel, caught between the hammer and the pulpit, unsure which duty to answer first."}
