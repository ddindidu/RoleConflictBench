My training kicked in\u2014protocol demanded I stop the train at the next station, alert security, and keep everyone calm. My heart pounded as I thought of the passengers\u2019 safety, the responsibility I carried for every soul on board. But as I reached for the intercom, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was supposed to lead the weekly study session for the kids at the synagogue in just an hour. I\u2019d promised their parents I\u2019d teach them about Shabbat, about the importance of community and tradition. They looked up to me, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding immediate action for public safety, the other asking for my presence to nurture the next generation. My hands trembled as I tried to figure out how to be in two places at once, torn between duty and devotion, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
