My client\u2019s future depended on my focus and presence; the judge had made it clear\u2014no delays, no excuses. As a lawyer, I was expected to be sharp, attentive, and available for every moment of the multi-day trial. Yet, as a devout Hindu, my mornings were sacred\u2014filled with prayers, chanting, and offerings that I never missed, not even once. The trial schedule clashed directly with my ritual times, and the thought of skipping even a single prayer filled me with guilt and anxiety. My family and community expected unwavering devotion, and I felt the weight of their hopes on my shoulders. I sat in my office, torn between my duty to my client and my commitment to my faith, my mind racing as I tried to find a way to honor both. The clock ticked closer to the trial\u2019s start, and my heart pounded with the pressure of choosing between two worlds that defined me."}
