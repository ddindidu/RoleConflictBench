The supervisor\u2019s voice crackled over the intercom, reminding all operators that the mandatory pre-shift briefing on the new operational procedures would begin in five minutes. Missing it could mean disciplinary action, or worse, risking passenger safety. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from the synagogue board: \u201cCongregation gathering soon. Are you ready for Shabbat?\u201d My sermon notes were still scattered, my thoughts unfinished. As their rabbi, I was expected to offer guidance, comfort, and wisdom\u2014especially today, when several members needed reassurance. My heart pounded with the weight of both uniforms: the one I wore, and the one I carried in my soul. I stood at the crossroads, the hum of the subway and the quiet call of Shabbat both pulling at me, each demanding my full presence."}
