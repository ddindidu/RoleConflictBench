I really need to get there fast.\u201d I glance at the clock on the dashboard. If I take this ride, I\u2019ll miss the start of the evening service at the synagogue. My rabbi always says that regular attendance is a sign of commitment, and I know my parents would expect me to be there, too. But as a taxi driver, I\u2019m supposed to be reliable, to show up when people need me, especially when they\u2019re in a hurry. The app pings again, and I picture the passenger anxiously waiting on the curb, maybe late for something important. My yarmulke feels heavier on my head as I weigh the responsibility to my faith against the duty to my job. I grip the steering wheel, heart pounding, torn between the pull of my community and the promise I made to a stranger."}
