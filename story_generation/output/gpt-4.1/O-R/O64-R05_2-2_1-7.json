My fingers move quickly, scanning groceries, counting change, trying not to make a mistake. The store manager glances at me, silently urging me to keep the line moving. But my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a reminder for the bar mitzvah I\u2019m supposed to officiate in less than an hour. Months of preparation, a family counting on me to guide their child through this sacred milestone. I glance at the clock, heart pounding. If I leave now, the store will be short-staffed at the busiest time, and my coworkers will have to pick up the slack. If I stay, I\u2019ll let down a family who trusts me as their rabbi. The weight of both uniforms presses on me, and I stand frozen, torn between the register and the bimah, between duty to my job and duty to my calling."}
