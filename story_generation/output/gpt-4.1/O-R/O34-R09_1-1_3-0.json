The pilot\u2019s voice crackles through: \u201cRequesting altimeter setting.\u201d My hand hovers over the mic, ready to respond with the numbers, a routine exchange I\u2019ve done a thousand times. But my phone vibrates\u2014my son\u2019s name flashes on the screen. It\u2019s almost time for our weekly study, the hour I set aside to teach him about our heritage, the stories and values that shaped generations before us. I promised him I\u2019d be there, that nothing would interrupt this sacred time. But the sector is busy, and my supervisor expects unwavering focus. The pilots rely on me for clear, immediate instructions; any delay could ripple into confusion or worse. My son, though, waits for me to pass on the traditions that make us who we are. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, the demands of the skies and the pull of my faith and family, each expecting my full attention, neither willing to yield. My heart pounds as I stare at the blinking cursor, caught between duty and devotion, knowing I can\u2019t be in both places at once."}
