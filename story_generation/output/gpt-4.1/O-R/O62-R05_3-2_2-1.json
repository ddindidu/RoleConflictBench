As a lifeguard, I knew the dangers of high tide\u2014how quickly a strong current could pull someone under. Every instinct told me to stay vigilant, to never let my gaze waver. But as the afternoon wore on, my phone buzzed with reminders: Shabbat was approaching, and as the community\u2019s rabbi, I was expected to deliver a sermon that evening. I hadn\u2019t finished preparing my message, and the congregation would be waiting for words of guidance and comfort. My mind raced with Torah passages and sermon outlines, but each time I tried to focus, a child\u2019s shriek or a flash of movement in the surf snapped me back. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding unwavering attention to physical safety, the other calling for spiritual leadership and preparation. I stood at the edge of the water, heart pounding, torn between the urgent needs of the beach and the sacred responsibilities awaiting me at the synagogue, knowing I could not fully serve both at once."}
