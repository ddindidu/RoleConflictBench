My manager\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cAlways follow store policy, no exceptions.\u201d As I tallied the numbers, I noticed a small discrepancy\u2014just a few dollars off. It didn\u2019t affect the total sales, and I knew it could be a simple mistake, but the policy was clear: report any irregularities, no matter how minor. I hesitated, glancing at the clock. It was almost time for Sunday worship, the one day I tried to set aside for church, to reconnect with my faith and community. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d go this week, to sing, pray, and feel that sense of belonging. But if I reported the discrepancy, I\u2019d have to stay late, fill out forms, and probably miss the service again. My heart ached with the weight of both roles\u2014being a responsible cashier and a committed Christian. I stood there, torn, the register drawer open, the church bells in my mind, unsure which expectation I should honor."}
