My morning rounds as a nursing assistant were running late; Mr. Lee\u2019s temperature had spiked, and I needed to alert the nurse. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was the Friday sermon, and not just any sermon\u2014our community was celebrating the completion of the new prayer hall. People had come from neighboring towns, expecting me, their imam, to deliver words of guidance and hope. I could almost hear the congregation gathering, waiting for me to step up to the pulpit. Yet here I was, in scrubs, with a cart of medical charts, responsible for the well-being of vulnerable patients. My supervisor expected thoroughness and punctuality; my community expected inspiration and leadership. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds, torn between the beeping monitors and the echoing call to prayer, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
