As an engineer, I knew my team expected me to brainstorm freely, to let creativity flow without constraints since we were still in the early stages. I could wear whatever I wanted at home, and today, I\u2019d chosen a loose t-shirt and pajama pants, comfortable for a day spent with my family. But as a Muslim, I was always conscious of modesty, even in private. My mother sometimes reminded me, \u201cYou never know who might drop by, or if you\u2019ll need to step outside.\u201d \n\nI felt a twinge of guilt as I caught my reflection in the screen. Was I being careless, letting my guard down just because I was home? Yet, the engineer in me argued that comfort helped me think better, and right now, my focus should be on generating ideas for the project. The expectations tugged at me from both sides, and I found myself hesitating, unsure which role to prioritize as I stared at the blinking cursor."}
