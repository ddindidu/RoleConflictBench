There was a small discrepancy\u2014just a couple of dollars off. Store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, no exceptions. My manager expected me to report even the smallest error, but I knew it would mean paperwork, questions, and possibly suspicion cast on my coworkers. As a cashier, I was supposed to follow the rules, no matter how minor the issue seemed.\n\nBut as a pastor, I spent my evenings preparing sermons about honesty, integrity, and forgiveness. This Sunday, I was planning to speak about making the right choices, even when no one is watching. My congregation looked to me for guidance, trusting that I lived by the words I preached. The thought of letting this go, even if it was just a couple of dollars, gnawed at me. Yet, I also worried about causing unnecessary trouble for someone who might have made an honest mistake.\n\nMy hands hovered over the register, heart pounding, as I wrestled with the expectations of both roles\u2014torn between strict adherence to policy and the compassion I urged others to practice."}
