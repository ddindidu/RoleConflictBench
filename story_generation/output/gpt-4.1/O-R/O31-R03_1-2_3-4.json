As a police officer, staying fit isn\u2019t just a personal goal\u2014it\u2019s a duty. My captain always says, \u201cYou can\u2019t protect others if you can\u2019t protect yourself.\u201d I was about to head out when Sister Agnes appeared in the hallway, her face drawn with worry. \u201cWe\u2019re holding a special healing service for Sister Maria. She\u2019s taken a turn for the worse. Will you join us in prayer?\u201d My heart twisted. As a nun, I\u2019m expected to be present for my sisters, especially in times of need. The chapel bell began to ring, calling us together. I glanced at my gym bag, then at the chapel doors. Duty to my badge pulled me one way, duty to my habit another. The weight of both uniforms pressed on my shoulders, and I stood frozen, torn between the world\u2019s safety and the sanctuary\u2019s solace, unsure which path to take."}
