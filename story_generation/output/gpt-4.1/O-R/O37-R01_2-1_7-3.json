My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cAlways wear your gloves and mask, and never skip a step.\u201d I\u2019d just finished sanitizing a patient\u2019s room when I saw Mrs. Lee, a regular at my church, sitting alone on a bench, her shoulders slumped. I knew she\u2019d been struggling since her husband passed. As her pastor, I felt a deep urge to sit beside her, offer comfort, maybe even hold her hand as I prayed with her. But my gloves were contaminated, and I hadn\u2019t yet washed up. The rules were clear\u2014no contact, no exceptions. Yet, the ache in her eyes pulled at me, the expectation to be present for my flock as strong as the protocols I was sworn to uphold. I hovered in the doorway, torn between the safety I was trained to maintain and the compassion I was called to give, my heart pounding as I weighed the risks and responsibilities of both my worlds."}
