He\u2019d pleaded with me to get him to the airport on time\u2014his flight was the only one out before the storm shut everything down. As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get him there safely and quickly, but the roads were slick, and every instinct told me to slow down. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the workshop I\u2019d spent weeks preparing for as a pastor was starting in less than an hour. Community leaders were counting on me to guide them through difficult theological questions, to be present and focused. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one demanding I brave the storm for a stranger\u2019s urgent need, the other calling me to shepherd my flock with wisdom and care. My heart pounded as I stared at the icy road ahead, torn between the expectations of those who needed me, and the fear of letting someone down, no matter which path I chose."}
