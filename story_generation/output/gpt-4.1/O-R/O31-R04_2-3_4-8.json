My mind raced, cataloging injuries, ensuring the ambulance had a clear path, and calming frantic witnesses. Protecting citizens and property\u2014this was my duty. Then my phone buzzed.

As the imam, I was expected to offer comfort, to listen, to help him find peace in his grief. I glanced at the chaos before me, the sirens wailing, the crowd growing. Both worlds pulled at me\u2014one demanding my presence to maintain order and safety, the other needing my compassion and counsel. My heart pounded as I weighed the urgency of each call, feeling the impossible stretch between my badge and my prayer beads, knowing someone would be left waiting."}
