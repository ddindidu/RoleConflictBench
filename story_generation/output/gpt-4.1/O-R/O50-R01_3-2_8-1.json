They were about to start a batch, but I could see from their confusion that they hadn\u2019t grasped the safety protocols I\u2019d explained earlier. My job demanded I step in, guide them, and prevent a potential disaster. Just as I moved toward them, my phone buzzed. It was Sarah from the congregation\u2014her message urgent, asking if I could talk. She was facing a life-altering decision and needed spiritual guidance, the kind of support I\u2019d promised to provide as her pastor. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the immediate, tangible risk in the factory, and the quiet, desperate plea for comfort and wisdom. My mind raced, torn between the duty to protect these workers and the call to shepherd a soul in distress. I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between the clang of machines and the silent cry for help, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
