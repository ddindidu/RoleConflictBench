The customer had ordered a moderately expensive gadget, and company policy was clear: I needed a signature. My phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014it was time for my midday mantra. I usually found a quiet moment to repeat it, even if I couldn\u2019t do the full ritual, but now I was standing at the customer\u2019s door, pen in hand, waiting for them to answer. My mind tugged in two directions. As a delivery person, I had to be alert, polite, and efficient, making sure the package was secure and the delivery confirmed. But as a Hindu, I felt the pull of my spiritual practice, the expectation to honor my faith even in small ways. I could hear footsteps approaching from inside, and my heart raced. Should I pause for my mantra, risking an awkward moment or a delay, or should I focus on the delivery, pushing aside my spiritual need? The door handle turned, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
