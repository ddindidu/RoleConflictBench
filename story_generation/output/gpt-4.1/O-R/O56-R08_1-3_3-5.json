It\u2019s poking my eye,\u201d she said, smiling apologetically. I glanced at the clock\u2014if I hurried, I\u2019d just make it to the mosque in time. But I\u2019d have to take off my abaya and scarf to work, as always, since hairdressing means leaning in close, and stray hairs cling to everything. I could see Mrs. Lee\u2019s trust in her eyes; she always left happy, and I prided myself on that. But the thought of rushing to the mosque afterward, hair clinging to my clothes, maybe not fully covered, made my stomach twist. I wanted to be there, presentable and clean, for the prayer. My hands hovered over my scarf, torn between my client\u2019s gentle request and my own need to honor my faith."}
