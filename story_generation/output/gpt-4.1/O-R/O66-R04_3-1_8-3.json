But as I turned onto the main road, my phone vibrated again\u2014this time, a message from the mosque committee. The guest speaker for Friday prayers had arrived early and was ready to give the sermon if I couldn\u2019t make it. I was the imam, expected to lead the community, to offer guidance and presence, especially on Fridays. My mind raced: the passenger\u2019s anxious texts, the congregation\u2019s silent anticipation, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest. I gripped the steering wheel tighter, torn between the duty to my passenger and the responsibility to my congregation, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
