As I walked past the filtration system, I noticed a strange noise and a faint smell of burning. My heart sank. A quick inspection confirmed my fear\u2014the filtration system was malfunctioning, and if left unchecked, it could put everyone at risk. I knew I had to act fast, call for repairs, and keep the pool closed until it was safe. But as I reached for my phone, I glanced at my watch. The main weekly service at the chapel was about to begin, and as the priest, I was expected to lead the prayers. The congregation would already be gathering, waiting for me to guide them, to offer comfort and hope. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me\u2014the whistle around my neck, the collar at my throat. The safety of the swimmers, the spiritual needs of my community\u2014both urgent, both demanding my presence. My hands trembled as I stood between the pool and the chapel, torn by the impossible choice."}
