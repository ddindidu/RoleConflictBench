As a doctor, I was expected to diagnose accurately, to trust the science and the tests, but nothing fit. The patient\u2019s fever, rash, and fatigue didn\u2019t match any single illness I knew. I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014my patient\u2019s health depended on my judgment. Just then, I noticed a colleague quietly slipping a friend ahead in the blood test queue. It was a small act, but as a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma, to act ethically and fairly in all things, no matter how minor. My mind raced: should I confront my colleague, risking workplace tension, or stay silent and focus on the medical puzzle before me? Both roles demanded my attention, but their expectations pulled me in different directions. I felt the tension coil in my chest, torn between my duty to my patient and my duty to my principles."}
