Store policy is clear: every cent must be accounted for, no matter how minor. My manager expects me to report even the smallest error, and I know the importance of integrity in this job. But as I stare at the numbers, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a reminder: the conversion candidate\u2019s final study session is in fifteen minutes. They\u2019ve worked so hard, and this session is crucial before their Beit Din. As their rabbi, I\u2019m expected to guide them, to be present and attentive, especially now. My heart pounds. If I stay to resolve the register issue, I\u2019ll be late and let down someone who\u2019s counting on me for spiritual support. If I leave, I risk neglecting my responsibility as a cashier and possibly facing consequences at work. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my full attention, and I feel torn, caught between the rules of the store and the sacred trust of my calling."}
