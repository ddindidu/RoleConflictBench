I gripped the steering wheel, my knuckles pale, as my passenger checked his watch for the third time in as many minutes. \u201cPlease, I can\u2019t miss this flight,\u201d he pleaded, anxiety sharp in his voice. As a taxi driver, I knew my duty: get him to the airport safely and on time, no matter the weather. But the roads were slick, and every minute lost to traffic was a minute stolen from my other life.\n\nEarlier, I had looked forward to a rare, quiet afternoon at the convent. My Bible and journal waited for me, promising solace and reflection. As a nun, I was expected to nurture my spirit, to seek peace and wisdom in stillness. Now, the storm outside mirrored the turmoil within me. Should I risk the treacherous roads to fulfill my duty as a driver, or should I honor my commitment to spiritual study and the safety of all? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I could not give to the other."}
