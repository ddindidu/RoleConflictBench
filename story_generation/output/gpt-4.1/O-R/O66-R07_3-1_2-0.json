My passenger, a nervous businessman, kept glancing at his watch, voice tight with urgency. \u201cPlease, I can\u2019t miss this flight. Is there any way you can go faster?\u201d His words pressed on me, the expectation clear: get him to the airport, no matter the weather. But the roads were slick, and every turn felt like a test of my skill and luck. I wanted to help him, to be the reliable driver he needed.\n\nYet, as the clock ticked closer to six, my mind drifted to the temple. Tonight was the evening chant, a ritual I rarely missed. My teacher always said, \u201cOur presence is our practice.\u201d The community would notice my absence, and I felt the weight of their silent expectation. I was torn\u2014between the duty to my passenger and the commitment to my sangha. The storm outside was nothing compared to the storm inside me, as I wrestled with which path to follow."}
