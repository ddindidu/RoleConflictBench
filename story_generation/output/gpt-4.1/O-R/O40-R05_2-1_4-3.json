The cabinetry project was behind schedule, and the electrician was waiting for me to finish the framework so he could install the wiring. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the adult education class at the synagogue. It was an optional session, but I knew several congregants were looking forward to discussing the week\u2019s Torah portion with me. I could almost hear their voices, eager for guidance and insight.\n\nBut here, in the workshop, my team depended on me. If I left now, the project would stall, and the client\u2014already anxious\u2014would be disappointed. Yet, as a rabbi, I felt a deep responsibility to be present for my community, to teach and inspire, even if the class was not mandatory. My mind raced, torn between the tangible demands of wood and nails and the spiritual needs of my congregation. I stood in the middle of the sawdust-strewn floor, heart pounding, feeling the weight of both callings pressing in from either side."}
