My shift as a cashier demands that I smile, stay patient, and help each customer as quickly as possible. I remind myself to be friendly, even as an upset customer slams their items on the counter, their voice rising with frustration. I feel the pressure to resolve their issue, to keep the line moving, to not let my own irritation show.\n\nBut inside, another expectation tugs at me. I had planned a quiet ten-minute window for mindfulness and meditation, a promise to myself to breathe and find calm amid the chaos. The clock ticks closer to that time, but the crowd only grows, and my manager\u2019s eyes flicker toward me, silently urging me to keep going. My mind is split\u2014one part pulled by the demands of my job, the other yearning for the stillness I promised myself. I feel the tension coil in my chest, the struggle between being the ever-cheerful cashier and the mindful Buddhist. The customer\u2019s voice sharpens, and I stand at the crossroads of my two worlds, uncertain which to serve."}
