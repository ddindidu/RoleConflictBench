My headset buzzed with voices\u2014colleagues coordinating, pilots requesting vectors, the storm outside forcing us to juggle handoffs with barely a breath between. My hands moved automatically, but my mind kept drifting to the convent\u2019s quiet halls. The Mother Superior\u2019s request echoed in my thoughts: lead daily reflections for the retreat, guide the sisters in spiritual study. I was expected to be a calm, steady presence, to prepare meditations that would nourish their souls. But here, in the tower, the demands were urgent, relentless. I felt torn\u2014my duty to the skies clashed with my calling to the cloister. The expectation to be present, attentive, and serene in both worlds pressed in on me, and I wondered how I could possibly meet them both. The storm raged on, inside and out, and I sat at my post, heart pulled in two directions, not yet knowing which voice I would answer."}
