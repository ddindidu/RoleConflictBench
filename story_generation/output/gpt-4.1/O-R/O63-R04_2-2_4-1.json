I still needed three more sales to hit my weekly target, and my manager\u2019s reminders echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cWe need results, not excuses.\u201d My fingers hovered over the call list, heart pounding, knowing that every call mattered. But then my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee: \u201cBackup is sick. Can you lead Maghrib prayer today? Everyone\u2019s counting on you.\u201d I glanced at the prayer schedule. Maghrib was in less than an hour, right when my shift ended, but if I left even a few minutes early, I\u2019d lose precious time to make those last calls. The congregation expected me to be there, to guide them in prayer, to be present in spirit and body. Yet, my job demanded I stay glued to my desk, chasing numbers, my livelihood on the line. My chest tightened as I stared at the screen, torn between the ringing phone and the call to prayer, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, waiting for me to choose."}
