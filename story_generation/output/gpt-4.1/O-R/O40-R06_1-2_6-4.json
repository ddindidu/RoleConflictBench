She explained how much the toy meant to her grandson and asked if I could repair it quickly. I examined the damage\u2014fixable, but it would take time and care. I glanced at the clock. Sunday service would start in less than an hour, and I\u2019d promised myself, and God, that I wouldn\u2019t miss another week. My pastor had spoken about the importance of community and worship, and I felt the weight of that expectation. Yet, as a carpenter, I knew the trust people placed in my hands, especially with something so precious. Mrs. Evans waited for my answer, her fingers nervously tracing the toy\u2019s faded paint. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the church pews and toward the workbench. I could feel the pressure mounting, the sense that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
