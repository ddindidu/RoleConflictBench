My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d I scrolled through my call list, heart pounding, knowing I\u2019d have to push hard, maybe even bend the truth a little, to convince someone to buy. But as I dialed the next number, I remembered the sermon from Sunday: \u201cLet all that you do be done in love.\u201d I pictured the elderly voices I often heard, the hesitation in their tone, the way I\u2019d sometimes rush them, glossing over details to meet my quota. Was I really showing kindness, or just seeing them as numbers? My finger hovered over the call button. The pressure to provide for my family and not let my team down warred with the quiet voice inside urging me to be honest, gentle, and caring. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to take as the seconds ticked away."}
