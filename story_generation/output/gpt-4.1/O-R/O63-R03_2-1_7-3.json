My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cBreaks are logged. Don\u2019t leave your station unless it\u2019s your scheduled time.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014my break wasn\u2019t for another hour. But the chapel bell tolled softly through the window, calling all sisters to morning prayer. In the convent, punctuality for prayer was sacred; absence was noticed, and the rhythm of our communal devotion depended on each of us being present. My headset felt heavier as I weighed the expectations: the company\u2019s demand for constant availability, the convent\u2019s call to spiritual discipline. My heart pounded with guilt and anxiety. If I stayed, I\u2019d betray my sisters and my vows. If I left, I\u2019d risk my job and the trust of my manager. The ringing phone and the distant hymn seemed to pull me in opposite directions, and I sat frozen, torn between duty and devotion, unable to move."}
