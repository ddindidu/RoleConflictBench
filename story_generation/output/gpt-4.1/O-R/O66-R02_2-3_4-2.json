As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: drive defensively, keep my passengers safe, obey every traffic law. But the clock on the dashboard glowed with a warning\u2014if I didn\u2019t hurry, I\u2019d miss the start of the most significant religious holiday of the year. As a priest, my congregation expected me to lead the prayers, to be present for every soul who would fill the pews tonight. My phone buzzed with messages from the church, their anticipation palpable. Yet, the roads were chaos\u2014cars weaving, brakes screeching, puddles hiding danger. Every instinct told me to slow down, to be cautious. But the weight of my priestly duty pressed on me, urging me to get there, to not let them down. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible: risk safety to fulfill my calling, or arrive late and fail those who needed me most."}
