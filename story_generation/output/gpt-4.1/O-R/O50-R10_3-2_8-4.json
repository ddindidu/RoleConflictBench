As the machine repairer, I was expected to guide them, to ensure they understood every safety protocol before running the next batch. But my mind was split. Across the room, I saw my friend, Rajesh, being berated by the supervisor for a mistake he hadn\u2019t made. The injustice was clear, and as a Hindu, my dharma called me to stand up for what was right, to speak out against unfairness.\n\nYet, the staff were about to start a hazardous process without proper knowledge. If I left them, even for a moment, someone could get hurt. If I stayed, I\u2019d be turning my back on my friend and my own principles. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding my technical expertise and vigilance, the other my moral courage. My heart pounded as I glanced between the blinking machine lights and Rajesh\u2019s downcast eyes, torn between duty and conscience, knowing I could not fulfill both at once."}
