As a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to take my breaks exactly as scheduled, no more, no less. Today, my break is coming up, but just as I\u2019m about to log out, my phone buzzes with a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She\u2019s in tears, desperate for someone to talk to. As her pastor, I know she needs comfort and spiritual guidance right now, not in thirty minutes when my break officially starts. My heart aches for her, but I can already imagine the stern email from my supervisor if I step away early. I stare at the clock, torn between the rigid structure of my job and the compassionate calling of my ministry, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
