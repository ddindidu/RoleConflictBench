Dispatch had said the patient\u2019s injury wasn\u2019t life-threatening, but every second still felt urgent. My training as an ambulance driver echoed in my mind: safety first, always. Yet, the pressure to arrive quickly gnawed at me, especially with the patient\u2019s family waiting anxiously. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes\u2014reminding me that a parishioner was waiting at the convent, desperate to talk about her crisis of faith. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and spiritual guidance. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me: the starched white habit beneath my jacket, the reflective vest over it. My heart raced, torn between the duty to drive safely and the call to be a spiritual anchor. The city lights blurred as I wrestled with the impossible choice, feeling the expectations of both worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
