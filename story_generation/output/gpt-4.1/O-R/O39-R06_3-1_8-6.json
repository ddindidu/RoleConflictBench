My foreman\u2019s voice cut through the noise, \u201cDrop everything! Muster point, now!\u201d I grabbed my hard hat and turned to leave, but then I saw Miguel, the new guy, frozen in place, panic written all over his face. The rules were clear\u2014no stopping, no helping, just get out. But my heart twisted. As a Christian, I\u2019m taught to show kindness, to help those in need, no matter what. I remembered the words of Jesus about loving your neighbor, and I knew Miguel needed someone right now. But the site protocol was strict, and I could already see the others streaming out, not looking back. If I stayed, I\u2019d be breaking the rules, risking my job, maybe even my safety. If I left, I\u2019d be turning my back on someone who needed help. My feet felt rooted to the spot, torn between the demands of my job and the call of my faith, the alarm still blaring in my ears."}
