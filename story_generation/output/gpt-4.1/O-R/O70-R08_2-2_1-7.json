The next package was groceries, and the customer had messaged twice already, saying they needed everything before six for a family dinner. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cOn-time delivery is everything. One late order, and we all hear about it.\u201d I felt the pressure in my chest, the weight of being reliable, of not letting anyone down.\n\nBut as I drove, my thoughts drifted to the group chat with my friends. They were sharing photos from Mecca, their faces glowing with excitement. This was the year I\u2019d promised myself I would go for Hajj. I\u2019d saved every extra tip, skipped outings, and planned carefully. Now, the season was here, and my friends were already there, fulfilling a pillar of our faith. My heart ached with longing and guilt. The money I\u2019d saved was just enough, but if I took time off, I\u2019d lose my job\u2014and maybe the chance to help my family.\n\nI gripped the steering wheel, torn between the duty to my job and the call of my faith, feeling the two worlds pulling me in opposite directions."}
