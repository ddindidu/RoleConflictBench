The school zone sign flashed, and I eased my foot onto the brake, watching children gather near the curb. The construction detour squeezed the lanes, making every move tense. As a taxi driver, I knew the rules\u2014drive slow, stay alert, protect the kids. But my phone buzzed with a message from my wife: \u201cHe\u2019s still struggling with his Torah portion. Bar mitzvah is in two weeks. Can you help tonight?\u201d Guilt twisted in my chest. I should be home, guiding my son, passing on the traditions my father gave me. But here I was, stuck in traffic, responsible for strangers\u2019 safety, my own child\u2019s needs tugging at my conscience. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014one demanding vigilance and patience behind the wheel, the other pleading for my presence and wisdom at home. I felt torn, the expectations of my job and my faith pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which path to follow as the light turned green."}
