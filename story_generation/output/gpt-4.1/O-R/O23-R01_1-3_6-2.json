I felt the weight of my oath\u2014client confidentiality was non-negotiable. I offered a polite smile, careful to keep my words vague, but curiosity pressed in from all sides. Later that evening, I met with a member of my congregation, her eyes red from crying. She poured out her heart, desperate for guidance as she faced a decision that could change her life. As her pastor, I wanted to offer comfort and wisdom, but the details she shared echoed too closely with the confidential case I was handling. My mind raced, torn between my duty to protect my client and my calling to shepherd my flock. The expectations of both roles pressed in, each demanding loyalty, each with its own code. I felt the tension coil inside me, unsure which path to follow as I sat in silence, listening to her plea."}
