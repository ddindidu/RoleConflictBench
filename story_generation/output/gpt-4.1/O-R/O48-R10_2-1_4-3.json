He was recovering from surgery, and I could see the worry in his eyes as I wrapped the blood pressure cuff around his arm. His numbers were a bit high, but nothing alarming. As I noted the readings, I glanced toward the nurses\u2019 station and saw a colleague quietly moving a friend\u2019s family member ahead in the queue for post-op checks. It was subtle, but clear\u2014a small act of favoritism. My heart tightened. As a nursing assistant, my duty was to focus on my patient, record his vitals accurately, and ensure his comfort. But as a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma, to act with honesty and fairness, even in small matters. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me: the expectation to stay professional and not disrupt the workflow, and the inner call to speak up for what was right. My mind raced, torn between my responsibilities and my conscience, as I stood in the hallway, uncertain of what to do next."}
