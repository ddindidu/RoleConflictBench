She\u2019d been waiting weeks for this repair, and I could see the relief in her eyes as the deck slowly took shape. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I wiped my hands before answering. It was Deacon Lee, his voice trembling. There\u2019d been a fire at the Johnsons\u2019 house\u2014no injuries, thank God, but the family was shaken and needed immediate support. As their pastor, I was expected to be there, to offer comfort, prayer, and guidance. I looked at the half-finished deck, Mrs. Carter watching from her window, and felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. The wood in my hands, the scripture in my heart\u2014both calling, both urgent. My mind raced, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to restore a home and the duty I felt to heal broken spirits. I stood there, tools in hand, heart heavy, unsure which path to take first."}
