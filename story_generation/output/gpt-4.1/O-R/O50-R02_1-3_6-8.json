They sounded nervous, asking for simple tips, and I could hear the anxiety in their voice. As a machine repairer, I knew how important it was to make them feel confident and supported, especially during their first week. My calendar buzzed\u2014reminding me of the final preparation session I was supposed to lead at the church in less than an hour. The family had been counting on me to guide their child through this last, crucial step before the sacrament. I could picture their hopeful faces, the trust they placed in me as their priest. My mind raced, torn between the client\u2019s immediate need for reassurance and the family\u2019s expectation for spiritual guidance. Both roles demanded my presence, my patience, my care. I felt the weight of their hopes pressing in from both sides, and for a moment, I just sat there, phone in hand, heart pounding, unsure which call to answer first."}
