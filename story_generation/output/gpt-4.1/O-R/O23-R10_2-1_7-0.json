As a Hindu, I was taught to honor my daily rituals, to set aside time for prayer and reflection. But the demands of my work as a lawyer often left me with only these brief, stolen moments. Today, as I quietly repeated the sacred words, my assistant knocked and entered, asking for access to a client\u2019s confidential files. She was new, eager to help, but unfamiliar with the case\u2019s sensitivity. I felt the weight of my profession\u2019s ethical standards pressing down on me\u2014client confidentiality was paramount, and I couldn\u2019t simply hand over the documents. Yet, her hopeful eyes reminded me of the Hindu value of kindness and support. My mind raced, torn between my duty to protect my client and my desire to help a colleague, all while feeling guilty for not performing my rituals fully. The tension between my roles tightened in my chest, and I paused, mantra unfinished, files untouched, caught between the expectations of my faith and my profession."}
