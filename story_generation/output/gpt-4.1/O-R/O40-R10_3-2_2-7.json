Today, before starting the new structural work, I needed to inspect and maintain every piece of equipment\u2014safety protocols were strict, and I knew too well the risks of neglect. But as I checked the teeth of my saw, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the family ceremony was in just a few hours. As a Hindu, it was my duty to be there, dressed in clean, traditional attire, to honor my ancestors and join my family in prayer. My mother had called twice already, reminding me not to be late. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I rushed the inspection, I could make it on time, but I\u2019d be risking safety on site. If I did the job thoroughly, I\u2019d be late for the ceremony, disappointing my family and disrespecting our traditions. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands of my work against the pull of my faith, caught between two worlds that both expected my full devotion."}
