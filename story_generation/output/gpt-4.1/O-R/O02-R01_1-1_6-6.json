The planning session was informal, and I knew the timeline could still shift, but everyone looked to me for a number. I felt the weight of their expectation\u2014my accuracy would shape the next few weeks for the whole team. Just as I was about to speak, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the community gathering at the church was starting soon. I was supposed to teach a lesson, weaving in a story about patience and faith. \n\nMy mind raced. If I stayed, I could give the team what they needed, but I\u2019d be late to the gathering, letting down people who counted on me for spiritual guidance. If I left, I\u2019d miss the chance to shape the project\u2019s direction, risking confusion and delays. I could almost hear the congregation\u2019s voices, waiting for me to share something meaningful, while my colleagues waited for clarity and leadership. The two worlds tugged at me, each expecting my full presence, and I sat frozen, torn between the demands of my roles."}
