My script only skimmed the surface, and I could sense his frustration growing. I glanced at the clock, knowing my shift was almost over, but my mind was already at the mosque. Just as I was about to transfer the call, my phone buzzed with a message: someone had arrived at the mosque, desperate for guidance after a devastating loss. As an imam, I knew my community expected me to be present, to offer comfort and wisdom in their darkest moments. But as a telemarketer, I was expected to handle every objection, to never leave a call unresolved. My heart pounded as I weighed the needs of a grieving soul against the demands of my job, feeling the tension pull me in two directions at once."}
