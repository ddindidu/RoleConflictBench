Store policy is clear: every cent must be accounted for, no matter how minor. My manager expects me to report even the smallest error, but I know it will mean paperwork, questions, and possibly suspicion cast on my honesty or competence. As I weigh my options, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s an email from a young couple, asking if I can officiate their wedding next year. As a rabbi, I\u2019m honored by their trust, and I know how important it is to respond promptly and warmly, to make them feel valued and supported at this pivotal moment in their lives. But the store is busy, and my break is almost over. I feel the pressure of both roles\u2014one demanding strict adherence to rules, the other calling for compassion and presence. My heart pounds as I realize I can\u2019t give both the attention they deserve at this moment."}
