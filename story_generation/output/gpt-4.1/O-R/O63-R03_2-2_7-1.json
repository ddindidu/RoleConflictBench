My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind\u2014\u201cNo extra minutes, the queue is full.\u201d I was supposed to be back on the phones in two minutes, but my phone buzzed with a message from Sister Agnes: \u201cThe family next door lost everything in the fire. We\u2019re gathering food and clothes now. Can you help?\u201d My heart twisted. As a nun, I was expected to be there, to serve, to comfort. But as a telemarketer, I was expected to be at my desk, every break accounted for, every call answered. I stared at the break room clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The guilt of possibly letting down my community warred with the anxiety of disappointing my manager. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which duty to honor, knowing that either choice meant letting someone down."}
