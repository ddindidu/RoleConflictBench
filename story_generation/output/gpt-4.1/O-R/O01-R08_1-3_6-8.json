As an architect, I was expected to keep projects on track, and my team relied on my steady hand to guide them. I glanced at the project timelines, making mental notes to check in with the contractors, but I didn\u2019t feel the usual urgency.

As a Muslim, the call to perform Hajj weighed heavily on my heart\u2014this year could be my last chance. My phone buzzed with a reminder about a site meeting, and I felt the pressure mounting. My colleagues expected me to be present, to manage every detail, but my faith demanded something deeper, something that couldn\u2019t be postponed.
