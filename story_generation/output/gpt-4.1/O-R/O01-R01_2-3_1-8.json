The contractor\u2019s timeline pressed on my mind, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the potential safety risks in the new community center\u2019s design. As an architect, I was responsible for every beam and bolt, ensuring nothing would endanger the people who would gather there. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the workshop I was leading tonight. As a pastor, I was expected to guide our community leaders through challenging theological concepts, helping them grow in faith and understanding. I knew they were counting on me to be present, focused, and prepared.\n\nBut the safety review demanded my full attention. If I left now, construction might continue with those flaws unaddressed. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down the leaders who needed my guidance. The weight of both roles pressed on my chest\u2014one demanding vigilance and technical precision, the other calling for spiritual wisdom and presence. I stared at the clock, heart pounding, torn between the safety of a building and the souls of my community, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both the attention they deserved at the same time."}
