The symptoms pointed to a common cold, but as a doctor, I knew I had to be thorough. I needed to ask the right questions, order the right tests if necessary, and ensure I didn\u2019t miss anything serious. Just as I was about to call him in, my phone buzzed. It was my close friend from the temple, eager to discuss a sermon on impermanence we\u2019d both heard last night. He wanted to talk now, saying he was struggling to understand its meaning and needed my perspective as a fellow Buddhist.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. My patient was waiting, expecting my full attention and expertise. My friend, too, was reaching out, hoping for spiritual guidance and companionship. I could sense the tension rising in my chest\u2014my duty to heal and my commitment to spiritual reflection pulling me in opposite directions. I stared at the phone, then at the patient\u2019s file, caught in the silent struggle between my roles, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
