The train hummed beneath me, packed with commuters. Suddenly, a red alert flashed: brake system malfunction. My training kicked in\u2014protocol demanded I report it and stop the train immediately, no matter what. My heart pounded. Today wasn\u2019t just any day. I was supposed to chant Torah at synagogue, something I\u2019d prepared for weeks. The service would start soon, and everyone was counting on me. My rabbi had reminded me how important it was to be present, to honor my commitment to the community and to God. But now, the safety of hundreds rested in my hands. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down, the sacred and the everyday, each demanding my full attention. My fingers hovered over the radio, my mind racing between duty and devotion, torn by the impossible timing of it all."}
