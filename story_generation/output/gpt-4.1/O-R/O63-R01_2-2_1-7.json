The phone rang, and another prospect launched into a barrage of technical questions\u2014details about data privacy, compatibility, things the script only skimmed. My supervisor expected me to handle objections smoothly, keep the call moving, and close the sale. But I felt a knot in my stomach as I dodged their questions, offering half-answers, feeling dishonest.\n\nLater, I opened my Bible, notes for Sunday\u2019s sermon scattered around me. I was supposed to guide my congregation in making moral choices, to teach them about honesty and integrity. The words I planned to preach\u2014\u201cLet your yes be yes, and your no, no\u201d\u2014echoed in my mind. How could I stand before them and speak about truth when, just hours before, I\u2019d skirted it for a sale? The expectations from both worlds pressed in on me, and I found myself staring at my sermon notes, heart heavy, unsure how to reconcile the two."}
