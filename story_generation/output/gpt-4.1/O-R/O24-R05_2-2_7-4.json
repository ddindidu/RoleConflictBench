As a judge, I knew I had to read and understand the ruling before the next session. The law demanded my diligence, and the parties deserved a fair, informed decision.\n\nBut as I reached for the printed opinion, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the children\u2019s religious class was about to begin. As their rabbi, I was expected to teach Torah, to guide them in faith and tradition. The parents trusted me to nurture their children\u2019s spiritual growth, and the kids looked forward to our weekly lessons.\n\nI stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both robes\u2014the black of the courtroom and the white of the synagogue. My mind raced with legal arguments and lesson plans, torn between the demands of justice and the call of faith. I closed my eyes, heart pounding, caught in the impossible space between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
