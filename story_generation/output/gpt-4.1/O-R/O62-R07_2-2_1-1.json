As a lifeguard, I knew my duty: every second, every breath, I had to be alert. Today, the pool was crowded, laughter echoing off the tiles, but my focus was on a young swimmer near the middle, their strokes growing weaker. My muscles tensed, ready to leap in if needed. Yet, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder of the memorial service at the temple tonight. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be there, to chant and offer incense with the community, honoring the departed. The abbot had asked me personally, and my absence would be noticed. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the urgent, physical responsibility to these swimmers, and the spiritual, communal obligation to my sangha. My heart pounded as I watched the struggling swimmer, torn between staying vigilant here and fulfilling my role at the temple. The sun dipped lower, and I realized I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
