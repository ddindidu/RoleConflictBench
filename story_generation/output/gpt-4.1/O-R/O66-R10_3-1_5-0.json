Up ahead, the yellow sign flashed: SCHOOL ZONE. Children clustered near the curb, their laughter and backpacks a reminder to slow down, to be vigilant. As a driver, I knew the rules\u2014drive defensively, protect every life, especially here. But my mind tugged elsewhere. It was nearly noon, the time I usually paused for my daily puja. Today, I hadn\u2019t managed more than a whispered mantra between fares, the full ritual lost to the rush of city streets. Guilt pressed on me; my faith asked for more than hurried words, for true devotion, not just habit. Yet, the road demanded my full attention now. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles\u2014one calling for spiritual discipline, the other for unwavering focus on the world outside my windshield. I glanced at the children, then at the small idol on my dashboard, torn between the sacred and the immediate, unsure which duty to honor in this moment."}
