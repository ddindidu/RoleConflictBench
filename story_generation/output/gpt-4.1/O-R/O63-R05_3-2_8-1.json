My headset pressed tight against my ear, and the automated compliance system loomed in my mind\u2014any unscheduled minute away from my desk could mean a warning, or worse. But as I listened to the monotone ring of another unanswered call, my thoughts drifted to the Torah portion I still hadn\u2019t finished preparing for tomorrow\u2019s Shabbat service. As a rabbi, my congregation expected a thoughtful, inspiring message, something to guide them through the week. The pressure to deliver weighed heavily on me, especially knowing how much comfort and wisdom people sought from my words. Yet, if I took even a few minutes now to jot down ideas or review my notes, the system would flag me. My supervisor had already warned me once. I felt the tension coil in my chest\u2014torn between the rigid demands of my job and the sacred responsibility to my community. The cursor blinked, the phone rang, and I sat frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which duty to honor in this moment."}
