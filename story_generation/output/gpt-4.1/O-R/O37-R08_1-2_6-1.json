The supervisor\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cAlways wear gloves, no exceptions. Safety and hygiene first.\u201d I know the rules, and I try to follow them, but sometimes, when the tasks pile up, I slip them on only for the dirtiest jobs. Today, as I scrub the bathroom tiles, my phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cRamadan \u2013 Day 15. Quran reading: Surah 12.\u201d My heart sinks. I\u2019m already behind on my daily reading, and the guilt gnaws at me. I want to find a quiet corner, remove my gloves, and touch the Quran with clean hands, as my faith teaches. But the clock is ticking, and the rooms still need cleaning. My mind races\u2014should I rush through my work, risking mistakes, or delay my reading even more? The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding something I can\u2019t fully give. I stand in the hallway, torn, the mop in one hand and my phone in the other, caught between duty and devotion."}
