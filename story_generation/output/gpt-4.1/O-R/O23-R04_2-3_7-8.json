As a lawyer, I was reviewing sensitive client files when my assistant knocked, asking for access to documents she wasn\u2019t cleared to see. She insisted it would help her organize the case load, but I knew the rules\u2014client confidentiality was absolute. I could see her frustration as I hesitated, torn between efficiency and ethics.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. A member of my congregation was waiting at the mosque, desperate for guidance after a devastating loss. As an imam, I was expected to be present, compassionate, and available, especially in moments of crisis. My heart ached for him, knowing how much he needed someone to listen, to offer comfort and prayer.\n\nI stared at the files, then at the clock, feeling the pull from both worlds. My assistant lingered, expecting a decision. The community member waited, hoping for solace. The demands of confidentiality and compassion collided within me, and I felt the tension rise, unsure which duty to answer first."}
