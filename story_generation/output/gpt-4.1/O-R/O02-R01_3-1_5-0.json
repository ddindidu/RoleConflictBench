The plant\u2019s operations were at risk\u2014if I didn\u2019t address the flagged issues by the end of the day, we\u2019d be forced to shut down. My phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She rarely reached out, but today she wrote, \u201cDo you have a moment? I really need to talk.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been struggling lately, and as her pastor, I felt a deep responsibility to be there for her, to offer comfort and guidance. But the clock was ticking, and every minute I spent away from the plant could mean non-compliance, lost revenue, and jobs on the line. My heart pounded as I stared at her message, torn between the urgent demands of my engineering role and the quiet, persistent call to shepherd someone in need. The weight of both worlds pressed in, and I found myself paralyzed, unable to choose which expectation to meet first."}
