My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cMake sure those bricks are moved to the back lot before you leave today.\u201d I glanced at the heavy stack, knowing it would take at least another hour of hard work. But tonight was Wednesday, and my church held its weekly service\u2014one I rarely missed. As a Christian, I felt a deep responsibility to worship and be present for my community, to show my faith through commitment. Yet, as a laborer, I was expected to finish every task, no matter how late it got. My hands ached, and my heart felt heavy, torn between the demands of my job and the pull of my faith. I stared at the bricks, then at the clock, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which duty I would ultimately choose."}
