Her hair was soft and clean, and I could smell the faint scent of her shampoo. The salon policy was clear: every client\u2019s hair must be washed and conditioned before a cut, no exceptions. My manager expected me to follow this rule, and clients often enjoyed the pampering. But today, it felt unnecessary, almost wasteful, especially since I was trying to save every bit I could. \n\nAs a Muslim, I dreamed of performing Hajj, but the cost was daunting. Every month, I set aside a small amount from my paycheck, hoping one day I\u2019d have enough. Yet, here I was, about to use expensive salon products and water on hair that was already clean, just to meet expectations. I felt a pang of guilt\u2014was I being wasteful when I should be mindful, especially with my goal so far away? My hands hesitated, torn between the rules of my job and the values of my faith, unsure which expectation I should honor in this moment."}
