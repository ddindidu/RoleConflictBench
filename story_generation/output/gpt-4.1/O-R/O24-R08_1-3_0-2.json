The hearing was in two weeks, but I knew the expectation: review every detail, no matter how routine the case seemed. My colleagues respected my diligence, and I prided myself on never being unprepared. Yet tonight, the community study circle would gather, and I was expected to recite and reflect on verses from the Quran I hadn\u2019t yet read. The anticipation in the group was high; I was supposed to lead the discussion, to inspire. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014one toward the solemn responsibility of justice, the other toward the spiritual nourishment I craved and the community that looked to me. I stared at the unopened file, then at my Quran, feeling the pressure of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait."}
