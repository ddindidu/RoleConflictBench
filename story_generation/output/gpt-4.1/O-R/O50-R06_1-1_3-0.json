As the lead machine repairer, everyone expected me to perform the routine servicing\u2014cleaning, oiling, and checking every part to keep the machines running smoothly. It was a responsibility I took seriously; any mistake could mean costly downtime for the company. But as I scanned the dates, my heart sank. The shutdown overlapped with Good Friday, a day I always set aside for prayer and reflection, honoring my Christian faith and the values I strive to live by.\n\nMy supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need you here, especially during shutdown.\u201d At the same time, I remembered my pastor\u2019s recent sermon about standing firm in faith, even when it\u2019s inconvenient. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. If I missed the servicing, I\u2019d let my team down. If I worked, I\u2019d compromise a core part of my beliefs. I sat at my workbench, tools in hand, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
