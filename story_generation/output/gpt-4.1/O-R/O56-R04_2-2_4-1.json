She hesitated, then quietly said the colour was too brassy, not what she\u2019d hoped for. My heart sank\u2014I knew how important it was to make a good impression, and I wanted her to leave happy. I was about to reassure her and offer to fix it when my phone buzzed. A message from the mosque committee flashed on the screen: \u201cBackup is sick. Can you lead the prayer in ten minutes?\u201d I glanced at the clock. The prayer was about to start, and the mosque was only a few blocks away, but I couldn\u2019t leave my client mid-appointment, especially when she was upset. Yet, as the imam, the community counted on me, especially today. My mind raced, torn between my duty to my client and my responsibility to the congregation, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
