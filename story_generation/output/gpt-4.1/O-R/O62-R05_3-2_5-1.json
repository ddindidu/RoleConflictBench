As the lifeguard on duty, I was responsible for every detail, and today, the filtration system\u2019s warning light blinked an angry red. If I didn\u2019t act fast, the water could become unsafe, putting every swimmer at risk. I knew I needed to call for repairs, maybe even close the pool, and oversee the process myself. But as I glanced at my watch, my heart tightened. Shabbat was only hours away, and as the community\u2019s rabbi, I was expected to deliver a thoughtful sermon\u2014one I hadn\u2019t finished preparing. Congregants would soon gather, looking to me for guidance and inspiration. My mind raced between the urgent safety hazard before me and the spiritual nourishment my community awaited. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, each pulling me in a different direction."}
