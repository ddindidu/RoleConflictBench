The client wanted open, collaborative spaces, but the employees needed quiet corners for focus. I was determined to design a layout that balanced both, knowing how much the staff depended on a functional environment. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for tonight\u2019s adult education class at the synagogue. It was an optional session, but I knew some congregants cherished these evenings, coming with questions about Torah and life, seeking guidance and connection.\n\nI glanced at the clock. The client expected revisions by morning, and I was nowhere near finished. Yet, as a rabbi, I felt a deep responsibility to be present for my community, to teach and listen, even if only a handful showed up. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the architect\u2019s duty to deliver excellence, the rabbi\u2019s calling to nurture souls. My mind raced, torn between the silent office and the waiting classroom, each demanding a part of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give tonight."}
