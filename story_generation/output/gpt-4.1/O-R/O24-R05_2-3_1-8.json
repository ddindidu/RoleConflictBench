As a judge, I know the importance of being prepared\u2014every detail matters, every argument must be weighed. The case is complex, and the parties deserve a fair, thoughtful hearing. My phone buzzes. It\u2019s the synagogue president. A beloved congregant has passed away, and the family is requesting me to officiate the funeral service tomorrow morning. As their rabbi, I am expected to be present, to offer comfort, to guide them through their grief. My heart aches for them, but my mind races with the obligations of the courtroom. I feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my best. I stare at the briefs, then at the phone, torn between my duty to justice and my calling to compassion, uncertain how I can possibly fulfill both."}
