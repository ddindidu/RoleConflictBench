The noon sun was harsh, but my mind was already on the Friday prayer. I had just enough time to change into my clean, modest clothes and make it to the mosque. As I reached the locker room, I saw a coworker, distracted and chatting on his phone, heading straight toward a crane lifting heavy steel beams overhead. My heart pounded. I knew the rules\u2014never walk under a suspended load. I had to shout, to warn him, to keep the site safe. But I was already dressed in my prayer clothes, the ones I wore to honor my faith and the sanctity of the mosque. If I shouted now, I\u2019d draw attention, maybe even disrespect the modesty I tried so hard to maintain. My hands trembled as I stood at the threshold, torn between the urgent need to protect my coworker and the deep responsibility I felt to uphold my religious values."}
