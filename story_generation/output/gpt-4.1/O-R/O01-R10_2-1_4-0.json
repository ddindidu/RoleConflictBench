My phone buzzes with messages from the project manager\u2014deadlines, revisions, expectations. Every inch of the floor plan must serve a purpose, every workspace must breathe efficiency. My mind races with calculations, but in the back of my head, a quiet voice reminds me it\u2019s time for my daily puja. I glance at the small altar tucked in the corner of my office, the incense unlit, the bell untouched. I whisper a mantra under my breath, hoping it\u2019s enough, but guilt gnaws at me. My family expects devotion, a full ritual, not this hurried whisper. I want to honor my faith, but the demands of my profession press in, relentless. My hands hover over the blueprints, torn between the world I build for others and the world I\u2019m supposed to nurture within myself. The clock ticks, and I feel the weight of both roles, each pulling me in a different direction, neither willing to let go."}
