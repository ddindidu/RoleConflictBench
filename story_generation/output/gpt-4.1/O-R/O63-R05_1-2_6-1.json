The call volume was unusually light today, and my supervisor had just sent a message reminding us we could take our breaks whenever we wanted, as long as we didn\u2019t all leave at once. I should have felt relieved, but my mind was elsewhere. Shabbat was approaching, and as the rabbi, I was expected to deliver a thoughtful sermon\u2014one that would resonate with the congregation and offer comfort and guidance. I hadn\u2019t even started preparing. \n\nThe expectation at work was clear: take my break, recharge, and be ready for the next wave of calls. But the congregation expected me to be present, prepared, and spiritually attuned. I stared at my computer screen, torn. Should I use this rare, flexible break to rest as my job encouraged, or should I seize the moment to begin crafting my sermon, knowing how much my community relied on me? The weight of both roles pressed down, each demanding something different, and I felt the tension rising inside me as I tried to decide what to do next."}
