She apologized for being late, explaining she\u2019d just come from the gym. Her hair was damp and oily, sticking to her forehead. I knew what was expected of me: wash and condition her hair before the cut, make her feel fresh and pampered. But my mind kept drifting to lunch. I was traveling for a hairdressing seminar, and the only kosher-certified food vendor nearby would close soon. If I took the time to give her the full wash and style, I\u2019d miss my chance to eat a proper meal that fit my Jewish dietary laws. If I rushed, I\u2019d be letting her down as a professional. My hands hovered over the shampoo bottles, heart pounding, torn between my commitment to my clients and my commitment to my faith."}
