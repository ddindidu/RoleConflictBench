She\u2019s upset about a coupon, her words clipped and impatient. I force a smile, reminding myself to stay calm, to be the friendly cashier everyone expects, even as my hands tremble. My manager glances over, expecting me to handle it smoothly, to keep the line moving. But my mind drifts to something deeper\u2014my parents called last night, asking if I\u2019d started saving for Hajj. As a Muslim, it\u2019s my duty, a pillar of my faith, but my paycheck barely covers rent and groceries. I feel the weight of their hope, the community\u2019s expectation, pressing against the demands of this job. I want to be patient, to serve with kindness, but inside, I\u2019m torn. The customer\u2019s frustration, my manager\u2019s watchful eyes, my family\u2019s gentle reminders\u2014all of it swirls together. I take a breath, caught between the world in front of me and the one I long to fulfill."}
