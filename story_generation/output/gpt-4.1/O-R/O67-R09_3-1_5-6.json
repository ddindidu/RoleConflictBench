Dispatch had just radioed in: a man in his fifties, severe chest pain, possible heart attack. My training as an ambulance driver kicked in\u2014every second mattered, and I was expected to provide immediate care, to be the calm in someone\u2019s worst storm. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart twisted. It was nearly time for the synagogue service, the one I\u2019d promised my family I wouldn\u2019t miss again. As a Jew, attending these services wasn\u2019t just tradition; it was a thread connecting me to my community and faith, a promise to my parents and to myself. I could already imagine the disappointment in their eyes if I didn\u2019t show. The ambulance\u2019s lights reflected off the windows of the synagogue as I passed by, torn between the urgent call of duty and the quiet pull of my faith. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to yield. I felt suspended in that moment, caught between saving a life and honoring the life I\u2019d been raised to lead."}
