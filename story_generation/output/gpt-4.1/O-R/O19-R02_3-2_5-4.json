Mrs. Lee sat across from me, her pill bottles lined up like soldiers. She was anxious, her new prescriptions a dangerous mix if not managed carefully. I needed to walk her through every detail, ensure she understood the risks, answer her questions, and calm her fears. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that Mr. Alvarez would be waiting for me at the church office in ten minutes. He\u2019d reached out for spiritual guidance, his voice trembling with the weight of his troubles. I knew how much he needed someone to listen, to offer comfort and hope. My mind raced, torn between my duty to Mrs. Lee\u2019s physical well-being and Mr. Alvarez\u2019s spiritual crisis. Both needed me, both expected my full attention, and I felt the pressure mounting, my heart caught between the science of healing and the art of comforting souls."}
