Mrs. Ramirez sat across from me, her nose red and her voice hoarse, describing her symptoms. The chart in my hand told me it was likely just a cold, but I knew she expected a thorough diagnosis\u2014she trusted me to be precise, to catch anything serious. Yet, as I listened, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the children\u2019s religious education class was about to begin at the parish hall. I was supposed to be there, leading them in stories and songs, teaching them about faith and kindness. The parents and children counted on me to be present, to guide them. My mind raced, torn between my duty to my patient and my responsibility to my parish. I felt the pressure of both roles, the expectations of accuracy and care as a doctor, and the warmth and guidance as a priest. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once, and I sat frozen, wrestling with which part of myself I would have to disappoint."}
