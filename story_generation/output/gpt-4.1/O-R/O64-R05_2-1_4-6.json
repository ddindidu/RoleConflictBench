Can I return it?\u201d she asks. Store policy is clear: no returns without proof of purchase. My manager expects me to enforce this, no exceptions. As I explain the policy, my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s an email from a young couple, asking if I can officiate their wedding next summer. They want to know if I\u2019m available, if I can guide them through the process, and I know how important it is to respond promptly and compassionately. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014one demanding strict adherence to rules, the other calling for warmth and flexibility. The woman\u2019s hopeful eyes meet mine, and I sense her disappointment growing. At the same time, I know the couple is waiting for reassurance and guidance. My mind races, torn between the rigid expectations of my job as a cashier and the pastoral care expected of me as a rabbi. I hesitate, caught between the demands of policy and the call to serve."}
