My phone screen glowed with frantic Slack messages: \u201cProduction down. Users locked out. Urgent.\u201d My heart thudded. I knew the bug was in my code\u2014I\u2019d been meaning to refactor that module, but deadlines had piled up. Now, customers were locked out, and the team was counting on me to fix it, fast. I opened my laptop, fingers hovering over the keyboard, but my mind drifted to the temple. My teacher had asked me to summarize the Four Noble Truths for tomorrow\u2019s session, a rare chance to deepen my practice and share with others. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d spend tonight in quiet study, not hunched over error logs. The weight of expectation pressed in from both sides: the team\u2019s urgent need, the sangha\u2019s trust, my own longing for stillness. I stared at the code, then at the sutra, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me, torn between the world\u2019s demands and the path of letting go."}
