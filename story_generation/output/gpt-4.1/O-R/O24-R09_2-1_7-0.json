I knew I had to read and analyze the decision before the next session\u2014my duty as a judge demanded it. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, I remembered tonight was our weekly study slot with my children. We\u2019d planned to explore the story of Ruth, discussing kindness and loyalty, values I want them to carry forward as Jews. I could reschedule, but I\u2019d promised them this time together. My children look forward to these lessons, and I feel responsible for nurturing their connection to our heritage. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the law\u2019s urgency on one side, my family\u2019s trust on the other. I stared at the unopened case file and the stack of children\u2019s books, torn between the demands of justice and the legacy of tradition."}
