But just as I was about to settle in, my phone buzzed. The nursing home needed me; a patient had just received a difficult diagnosis and was inconsolable. I rushed over, still in my home clothes, not thinking twice about my appearance. When I arrived, I saw her, shoulders shaking with sobs, alone in her room. My heart ached to comfort her, to sit close and offer the warmth and companionship she desperately needed. But as I reached out, I realized my tunic was a bit shorter than usual, and my scarf had slipped back in my hurry. I felt exposed, not dressed as modestly as I should be in front of non-family. The urge to fulfill my duty as a nursing assistant\u2014to be present, to hold her hand\u2014clashed with my deep commitment to my faith\u2019s guidelines. I stood there, torn, my hands hovering, my mind racing between the expectations of my profession and the principles I hold dear."}
