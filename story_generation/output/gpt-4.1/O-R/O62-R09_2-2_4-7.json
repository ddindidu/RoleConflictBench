As I walked along the deck, I noticed the lane rope was snapped, its frayed ends floating in the water. Swim lessons would start in less than an hour, and without that rope, the kids would be all over the place. I knew it was my responsibility as a lifeguard to fix it before the lessons began. But as I checked my watch, my heart sank. I was supposed to be at synagogue soon, not just attending, but chanting a Torah portion I\u2019d practiced for weeks. The rabbi and my family were counting on me. I could already picture the congregation waiting, the hush before my voice was supposed to fill the sanctuary. My supervisor expected the pool to be ready, the kids\u2019 parents expected a safe environment, and my community expected me to honor my commitment. I stood there, torn, the broken rope in my hands, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which expectation I could bear to let down."}
