Management\u2019s eyes are everywhere, tracking every minute I\u2019m away from my desk. My scheduled break is coming up, and I know I\u2019m expected to take it exactly on time\u2014no sooner, no later. As I watch the seconds tick down, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s my friend from the temple, asking if I have a moment to talk about the sermon we heard last night. I promised I\u2019d reflect on it, to deepen my understanding and share insights, as our practice encourages. But if I take the call now, I\u2019ll be off schedule, and management will notice. If I wait, I\u2019ll miss the chance for spiritual connection and let my friend down. My mind tugs in two directions: the rigid structure of my job and the gentle pull of my Buddhist path. I stare at the blinking cursor on my screen, feeling the tension coil in my chest, uncertain which expectation I can afford to disappoint."}
