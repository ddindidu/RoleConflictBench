The bride-to-be and her entourage rushed in, faces tense, eyes darting to the clock. I smiled, welcoming them, trying to ease their nerves. My hands moved quickly, offering tea, chatting about hairstyles, doing my best to make them feel at home. But as I sectioned the bride\u2019s hair, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Ahmed, a community member. He\u2019d mentioned earlier that he needed to talk, that he was struggling and hoped I could offer some guidance whenever I was free. Now, he was asking if I had a moment today. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. As a hairdresser, I was expected to be present, attentive, and calm for my clients, especially on a day as important as this. But as an imam, I knew Ahmed was reaching out in a moment of vulnerability, expecting compassion and wisdom. I glanced at the anxious bride in my chair, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which need should come first."}
