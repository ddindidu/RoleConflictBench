A couple of regulars approach, and I greet them with a smile, making small talk as I ring up their groceries. My manager expects me to be cheerful and attentive, to make every customer feel welcome. I do my best, even when my mind is elsewhere. Lately, it\u2019s been hard to focus. The doctor\u2019s words echo in my head: if I want to perform Hajj, it has to be this year. My health is slipping, and soon, long journeys will be impossible. As a Muslim, this pilgrimage is a sacred duty, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation. But the store is short-staffed, and my absence would leave my coworkers struggling. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my faith calling me to Mecca, my job demanding my presence here. I force another smile as I hand a customer their change, my heart torn between two paths, unsure which one I\u2019ll be able to walk."}
