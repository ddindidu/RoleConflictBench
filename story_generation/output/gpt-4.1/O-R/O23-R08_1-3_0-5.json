It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I prided myself on being thorough and timely. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for Friday prayer. I glanced at the clock. I had just enough time to get to the mosque, but as I stood, I realized I was still in my work suit: tailored, but the pants a bit too fitted, the shirt a little too short at the sleeves. I hesitated. As a Muslim, I knew the importance of dressing modestly, especially for Friday prayer. The expectation was clear: loose, non-revealing clothing, sleeves to the wrist, pants to the ankle. But I hadn\u2019t brought a change of clothes, and if I went home, I\u2019d miss the prayer. If I stayed, I\u2019d be late reviewing the contract, letting down my client and my own professional standards. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my duty to my faith, my responsibility as a lawyer\u2014caught between two worlds, both demanding, both important."}
