The nurse\u2019s voice trembled\u2014someone\u2019s life depended on my skill and speed. I grabbed my toolkit and rushed down the hall, my mind already racing through possible causes and fixes. But as I reached the ICU doors, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the most significant religious holiday of the year was about to begin. The sanctuary would be full, the community waiting for me to lead prayers, to offer comfort and guidance. I could picture their expectant faces, hear the hush as they waited for my words.
