As a judge, I was expected to stay updated on every legal development, and today, an attorney had cited a new appellate court decision that could change the course of tomorrow\u2019s hearing. I needed to read it thoroughly, analyze its implications, and be ready to question both sides. But as a Muslim, I also valued the comfort and modesty of my home attire\u2014loose, simple clothes, a hijab only if guests arrived. Today, I had planned to spend the day with my family, relaxing in our private space, away from the formality of the courtroom.\n\nYet, the weight of my judicial robe seemed to linger even here. Should I change into more formal, modest attire to read the case, as if donning the mindset of a judge? Or could I allow myself the comfort of my home clothes, trusting that my faith and professionalism could coexist, even in this moment? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt the tension rising as I stared at the unopened legal document on my laptop."}
