As the lead architect, everyone looked to me to keep things moving, to resolve disputes, to make sure nothing slipped through the cracks. Today, a heated argument erupted between two teams\u2014one blaming the other for a delay that could cost us the contract. I was expected to mediate, to keep tempers in check, and to push everyone forward, no matter what.\n\nBut then I overheard something that made my heart sink. My friend, Rajesh, was being unfairly blamed for a mistake he didn\u2019t make. The project manager, under pressure, was scapegoating him to save face. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma\u2014for what is right\u2014even if it means going against authority. My conscience screamed at me to speak up, to defend Rajesh, but I knew that doing so could disrupt the fragile peace I\u2019d worked so hard to maintain. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding something different, and I felt torn, paralyzed by the impossible choice before me."}
