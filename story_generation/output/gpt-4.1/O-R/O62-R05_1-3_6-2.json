The sun beat down, and the laughter of children echoed across the water. My eyes caught a group of kids slipping into the shallow end, unsupervised. I knew the rules\u2014no one in the water without an adult. I was supposed to enforce them, keep everyone safe, even if it meant being stern or unpopular. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the High Holiday sermon. As the rabbi, I was expected to deliver a message that would inspire and guide my congregation, and the service was only hours away. I hadn\u2019t finished my notes, and the words I\u2019d written so far felt hollow. My mind raced between the pool and the pulpit, between the safety of these children and the spiritual needs of my community. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me, the whistle around my neck and the yarmulke in my bag. I watched the kids, my heart pounding, torn between blowing the whistle and opening my laptop, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
