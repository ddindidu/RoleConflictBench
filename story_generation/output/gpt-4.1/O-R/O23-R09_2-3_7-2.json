My assistant, new to the firm, knocked and asked for access to a client\u2019s confidential files, explaining it would make her job easier. As a lawyer, I knew the rules\u2014client confidentiality was sacred, and I couldn\u2019t just hand over sensitive information, no matter how convenient it might be. But she looked overwhelmed, and I felt a pang of guilt for not making her transition smoother.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my son\u2019s bar mitzvah was only weeks away. He was struggling with his Torah portion, and I\u2019d promised to help him practice tonight. As a Jewish parent, it was my duty to guide him, to pass on our traditions and values. But the work kept piling up, and I was torn between staying late to handle the assistant\u2019s request properly or rushing home to be the teacher my son needed.\n\nThe expectations from both worlds pulled at me, each demanding my full attention. I stared at the files, my heart pounding, caught between my professional oath and my family\u2019s heritage, unsure which role I could afford to let down."}
