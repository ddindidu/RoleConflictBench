The monastery\u2019s festival was today\u2014the one day I promised to help from the first light, arranging offerings and greeting the elders. I could already hear the gentle chanting, see the faces of my teachers expecting my presence. But the dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent, and I knew the city traffic would slow me down if I didn\u2019t leave now. My duty as a driver was clear: someone needed help, and every minute mattered. Yet, as a Buddhist, I was taught to honor my commitments, to be present for my community, especially on sacred days like this. I stood at the threshold, keys in one hand, prayer beads in the other, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
