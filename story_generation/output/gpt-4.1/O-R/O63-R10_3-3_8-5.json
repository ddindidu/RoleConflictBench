My break was still twenty minutes away, but as I listened to the hum of voices around me, I caught a whispered conversation from the next desk. My supervisor, thinking no one could hear, was arranging to falsify sales numbers with another agent. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act with honesty and courage when faced with wrongdoing. But the automated compliance system watched every second of my time. If I left my desk or made an unscheduled call to HR, the system would flag me, and I could face disciplinary action or even lose my job. The pressure of my telemarketer role demanded strict adherence to schedules, no exceptions. Yet my conscience screamed at me to do something now, not later. I stared at the blinking cursor on my screen, torn between the rules of my workplace and the deeper rules of my faith, feeling the weight of both pressing down on me."}
