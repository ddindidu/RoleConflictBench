As a nursing assistant, I knew my place was by her side, offering comfort and a listening ear. She had just received news that her illness had worsened, and her family wouldn\u2019t arrive until evening. My training and my own compassion told me to sit with her, to hold her hand, to be present in her pain.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: it was nearly time for Asr prayer. As the imam, I was expected to lead the congregation, even if today the group was small and another brother was available. The community looked to me for guidance, for stability, for the familiar cadence of my voice in prayer. I could imagine the quiet disappointment if I didn\u2019t appear, the subtle questions about my commitment.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders. My heart ached for Mrs. Rahman, but my sense of duty to the mosque tugged at me. I stood in the hallway, wrestling with the impossible choice, feeling the expectations of both worlds closing in."}
