The plant was quiet\u2014production was slow, and this machine hadn\u2019t been used in weeks. My supervisor expected me to diagnose and fix the glitch quickly, even though it only happened now and then. As I waited for the fault to appear, I noticed a coworker quietly slipping ahead in the queue for overtime sign-ups. It was subtle, but I saw it. As a Hindu, I was raised to value honesty and fairness, to act when I saw something wrong, no matter how small. But as the only machine repairer on shift, I was expected to focus on the technical problem, not get distracted by workplace politics. My mind tugged in two directions: should I speak up about the line-cutting, risking my supervisor\u2019s irritation and possibly delaying the repair, or should I ignore it and stay focused on the machine, betraying my own sense of dharma? The machine\u2019s gears clicked again, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me."}
