They were confused about a line item on their latest invoice and needed clarification before processing payment. As the company\u2019s accountant, I knew how important it was to respond quickly and clearly\u2014delays could mean cash flow problems for us. I opened the invoice, scanning for the issue, but my mind kept drifting. Ramadan was halfway through, and I was already behind on my daily Quran reading. I had promised myself to catch up today, to sit quietly and reflect, but now the pressure of work was pulling me in another direction. My manager expected prompt communication with clients, and I didn\u2019t want to let anyone down. At the same time, I felt the weight of my spiritual commitment, the desire to reconnect and not let this holy month slip by in a blur of spreadsheets and emails. My heart raced as I stared at the screen, torn between the demands of my profession and the pull of my faith, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
