The family waited inside, their faces drawn with worry. As a doctor, I knew I had to explain the diagnosis with clarity and compassion, to answer their questions and offer comfort, no matter how painful the truth. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that it was nearly time for Friday prayers. As the imam, the congregation expected me to deliver the Khutbah, to guide them spiritually and offer words of hope. The guest speaker was ready, but I knew many in the community looked forward to my sermons, especially today, when the topic was close to their hearts. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing in. My duty to the family, to be present in their moment of need, clashed with my responsibility to the congregation. My mind raced, heart pounding, as I stood in the hallway, caught between the expectations of healer and spiritual guide, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
