The main production unit had been down for half an hour, and every minute meant mounting losses. My hands itched to grab my toolkit, to dive into the tangle of wires and blinking lights, to diagnose and fix what was broken. That was my job\u2014my responsibility.\n\nBut my eyes flicked to the clock. In ten minutes, I was supposed to lead the weekly meditation session at the temple. People would be gathering, expecting me to guide them into stillness, to embody calm and presence. I could already picture the quiet room, the soft cushions, the gentle anticipation in their faces. As a Buddhist, I was supposed to be a model of mindfulness, to show that peace was possible even in chaos.\n\nMy mind raced, torn between the clamor of machines and the hush of meditation. Both worlds needed me, both demanded my full attention. I felt the tension coil in my chest, the weight of incompatible expectations pressing down, and I stood frozen, caught between the call to repair and the call to be still."}
