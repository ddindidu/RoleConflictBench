That was when my evening prayers should begin, and I never missed them. My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me that discipline in rituals was the foundation of a good life. But tonight, the networking event was running late, and I was surrounded by colleagues and potential clients. Just as I glanced at my watch, a senior partner approached, introducing me to a curious businessman. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the most interesting case you\u2019re working on?\u201d he asked, his tone light but his eyes sharp. I felt the weight of my oath as a lawyer\u2014client confidentiality was sacred, and even a hint could breach trust. At the same time, the minutes ticked by, and I could almost hear the temple bell in my mind, calling me to prayer. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between the demands of my profession and the pull of my faith, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
