The machines hummed quietly, waiting for my hands to keep them running smoothly. Next week\u2019s shutdown was my window to perform the maintenance they desperately needed\u2014cleaning, tightening, ensuring every gear and belt would last another season. The foreman had reminded me twice already: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any delays. Everything must be perfect before we restart.\u201d\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, the chapel bell began to toll. Morning prayers were about to begin, and as a nun, I was expected to be present, kneeling with my sisters, my mind and heart focused on devotion. The Mother Superior had spoken gently but firmly last night: \u201cOur spiritual duties come first. The community looks to your example.\u201d\n\nMy hands trembled, torn between the grease-stained tools and the rosary beads in my pocket. The machines needed me, but so did my faith community. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait. The bell\u2019s echo lingered as I stood frozen, caught between the call of duty and the call to prayer."}
