The sun beats down, and the water sparkles, but my mind is elsewhere. I watch a group of teenagers laughing, sometimes drifting toward the deep end. I know my job: I must be vigilant, never distracted, always ready to act. Every life here is my responsibility. But my phone buzzes in my bag\u2014another message from my friends, already booking their flights for Hajj. I\u2019ve saved for years, and this is the season I promised myself I would go. As a Muslim, performing Hajj is a sacred duty, a pillar of my faith. My heart aches to join them, to fulfill this lifelong dream. But if I leave, who will watch over these swimmers? The pool manager says it\u2019s hard to find substitutes, especially on short notice. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the call of my faith and the duty to protect. My hands grip the chair tighter as I wrestle with what I owe to others and what I owe to God, torn between the pool and the pilgrimage."}
