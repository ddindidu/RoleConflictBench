He pleaded with me to drive faster\u2014his international flight wouldn\u2019t wait, and the airport was still miles away. Every red light, every cautious turn, I felt his impatience pressing on me. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get him there safely and on time, but the roads were slick, and I couldn\u2019t risk an accident.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with reminders from the synagogue. Tonight was the High Holiday service, and I was to deliver the sermon I\u2019d spent weeks preparing. The congregation would be gathering soon, waiting for words of comfort and inspiration. I could picture their faces, the expectation in their eyes. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles\u2014one demanding I brave the storm for a stranger\u2019s urgent need, the other calling me to lead my community in a sacred moment. I felt torn, the demands of duty and faith pulling me in opposite directions, unsure which path I could take."}
