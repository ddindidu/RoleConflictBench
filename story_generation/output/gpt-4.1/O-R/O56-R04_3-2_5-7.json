She glared at her reflection, her voice rising with every complaint about the cut. I knew I should listen patiently, offer solutions, and make sure she left satisfied\u2014my reputation as a hairdresser depended on it.

As an imam, I was expected to be there for her, to offer comfort and guidance when she needed it most. My heart pounded as I glanced between the client\u2019s scowl and the unread message. Both needed me, both expected my full attention, and I felt the weight of their needs pressing in from all sides. I stood frozen, scissors in hand, torn between the demands of my two worlds."}
