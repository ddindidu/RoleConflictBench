Every detail mattered\u2014emergency routes, sterile corridors, the flow between operating rooms. The hospital board expected nothing less than perfection, and I felt the weight of their trust. My phone buzzed, a gentle reminder: the daily prayer service would begin in fifteen minutes. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead, to offer comfort and guidance, even if today\u2019s service was optional. I glanced at the clock, heart pounding. If I left now, I\u2019d lose precious time, risk missing a critical design review with the engineers. But if I stayed, I\u2019d let down those who sought solace in prayer, those who counted on my presence. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself pulled apart, torn between the sacred and the practical, between the needs of the body and the needs of the soul."}
