As a carpenter, I have been entrusted with a large-scale project\u2014my biggest yet. The blueprints are spread across my worktable, lines and measurements blurring together. I know I must study every detail tonight, or risk mistakes that could cost my reputation and the trust of my crew. Yet, as the imam, I am also expected to deliver the Friday sermon tomorrow, a special one marking a milestone for our community. People are traveling from distant towns, eager to hear words of guidance and hope. My congregation expects inspiration, wisdom, and presence. My hands ache from the day\u2019s labor, but my mind is torn. If I focus on the blueprints, I may neglect the spiritual preparation my sermon demands. If I pour my heart into the sermon, I may overlook crucial details for the project. The weight of both roles presses on my chest, and I sit in silence, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
