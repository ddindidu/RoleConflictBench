My manager\u2019s email was clear: \u201cWe need your estimates by noon. The client is waiting, and the contract can\u2019t move forward without them.\u201d I knew the numbers had to be precise\u2014too optimistic, and we\u2019d be drowning in overtime; too cautious, and we might lose the deal. My mind raced through calculations, weighing risks and resources.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a colleague, Sarah. She sounded desperate\u2014her mother was in the hospital, and she needed someone to cover her tasks for the day. I remembered the words from Sunday\u2019s sermon: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d I wanted to help, to show the compassion my faith calls me to. But if I stepped away now, I\u2019d miss the deadline, letting my team and the client down.

The clock ticked on, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which path to take."}
