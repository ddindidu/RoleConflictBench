My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my eyes kept drifting to the calendar. Today was the main weekly service at the church, the one I led as a priest, the one my congregation counted on for comfort and guidance. I could already imagine the pews filling, the expectant faces, the hush before the opening prayer. My heart pounded with guilt. If I left now, I\u2019d let my sales team down, maybe cost them their bonuses. If I stayed, I\u2019d abandon my flock, leaving them without their shepherd. The pressure from both worlds pressed in, and I felt torn in two, unable to silence the demands of either calling."}
