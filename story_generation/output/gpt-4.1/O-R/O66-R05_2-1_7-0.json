They looked exhausted, grateful for a ride, and asked if I could help load their bags. I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift was almost over, but I prided myself on being a professional, always willing to go the extra mile for my passengers. As I hoisted their luggage into the trunk, they mentioned wanting to split the fare, and I nodded, already calculating the best route in my head.\n\nBut as I closed the trunk, my phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: time to start brainstorming for my next Shabbat sermon. The congregation expected inspiration, wisdom, and careful preparation. I felt the weight of their trust, knowing that my words could offer comfort or guidance. Yet here I was, sleeves rolled up, sweat on my brow, far from my study and the quiet needed for reflection. The demands of both roles pressed in on me\u2014my passengers waiting, my community depending on me\u2014and I stood there, keys in hand, torn between service on the road and service at the pulpit."}
