The defendant\u2019s anxious family waited outside, desperate for news. As a judge, I knew the urgency\u2014my order would determine whether he spent another night in custody. The law demanded clarity, precision, and speed. I opened a blank document, fingers poised, but my mind wandered. Shabbat was approaching, and as the rabbi of my small congregation, I was expected to inspire, to offer hope and wisdom. The board had gently reminded me that my sermons had felt rushed lately. I owed them my best, and the time to begin was now, while ideas were fresh. Yet, the legal order could not wait. I felt the weight of both robes\u2014one black, one white\u2014pressing on my shoulders. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, torn between the immediate needs of justice and the spiritual nourishment my community expected. The clock ticked, and I wrestled with the impossible choice, feeling the demands of both worlds pulling me apart."}
