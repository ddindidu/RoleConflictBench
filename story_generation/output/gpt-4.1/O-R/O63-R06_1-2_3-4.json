The numbers on my screen are better than ever\u2014if I keep this up, I\u2019ll crush my sales target by Friday. My manager\u2019s praise still rings in my ears, and I know she\u2019s counting on me to keep the momentum going. But as I glance at the clock, I remember tonight is the midweek church service. I haven\u2019t missed a week in months, and I know how much it means to my faith and my community to be present, to worship, to serve.
