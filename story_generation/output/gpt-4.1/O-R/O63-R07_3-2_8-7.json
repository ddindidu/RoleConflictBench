My headset itches against my ear, and the hum of the call center buzzes in the background. The compliance system is relentless\u2014every minute I\u2019m not logged in is tracked, flagged, and reported. I\u2019m supposed to take my break in exactly fifteen minutes, not a second sooner, or risk a warning. But tonight is the weekly study circle at the temple, and we\u2019re discussing a chapter I haven\u2019t even opened. My teacher expects us to come prepared, to reflect deeply, to share insights. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the rigid schedule of my job, the gentle but insistent call of my spiritual path. My mind races\u2014should I sneak away early, risking a mark on my record, or stay and miss the study, betraying my commitment to the sangha? My heart aches with the tension, torn between the demands of survival and the longing for meaning. The clock keeps ticking, indifferent to my struggle."}
