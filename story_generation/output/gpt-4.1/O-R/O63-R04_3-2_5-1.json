My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales before five o\u2019clock, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d The pressure was suffocating. I glanced at the clock\u20144:15 p.m. My heart pounded. At 4:30, I was expected at the mosque. The regular backup imam was out of town, and the congregation would be waiting for me to lead the prayer. I imagined the rows of familiar faces, their trust in me, their need for guidance and comfort. Yet, here I was, tethered to my headset, knowing that every minute spent away from the phone could cost my team dearly. My mind raced with guilt and anxiety. If I left now, I\u2019d let down my colleagues and risk our livelihoods. If I stayed, I\u2019d betray the faith and trust of my community. The call list blurred before my eyes as I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, each demanding all of me at the same time."}
