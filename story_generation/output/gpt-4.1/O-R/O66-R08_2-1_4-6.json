As a taxi driver, I was expected to drive carefully, obey every traffic law, and keep my passengers safe, especially on nights like this when cars darted unpredictably between lanes. My hands gripped the wheel tighter each time a vehicle swerved too close, my heart pounding with the responsibility of getting everyone home in one piece. But as I waited at a red light, my thoughts drifted to my other role\u2014my faith. As a Muslim, I felt the growing pressure to save for Hajj, the pilgrimage I was expected to make at least once in my life. Yet, with my modest earnings and the constant expenses of daily life, the goal seemed impossibly distant. Each day behind the wheel, I felt the weight of both roles: the duty to drive safely and the spiritual obligation to fulfill a pillar of my faith. The rain blurred the city lights, and I found myself caught between the demands of the road and the longing in my heart, unsure which path to follow first."}
