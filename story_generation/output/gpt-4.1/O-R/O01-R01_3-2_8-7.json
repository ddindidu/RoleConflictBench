The project was behind schedule, and the client was growing impatient. As the architect, everyone looked to me to resolve the delays, to keep the teams motivated and the work moving. I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing on my shoulders. Yet, in the quiet moments between calls, my mind drifted to the sermon I needed to prepare for Sunday. As pastor, my congregation depended on me to offer guidance, to help them navigate the moral complexities of their lives. I knew they expected a message that was thoughtful and inspiring, something that would linger in their hearts long after the service ended. But every time I tried to focus on the sermon, urgent emails and calls from the site pulled me back. I felt torn, stretched thin between two worlds, each demanding my full attention. The pressure built inside me, a silent struggle between the architect who must deliver results and the pastor who must deliver hope."}
