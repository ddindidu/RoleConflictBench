She looked up at me with tired eyes, her voice barely above a whisper as she asked if I could stay a little longer. She said the nights felt endless and lonely, and I could see the longing for company in her gaze. I knew how much these moments meant to her, how a simple conversation could ease her heart.\n\nBut as I sat beside her, I felt the weight of another expectation pressing on me. It was a quiet evening, the kind I rarely got, and I had planned to spend it reciting and reflecting on the Quran, something my faith encourages me to do regularly. The thought of that peaceful time, connecting with Allah and finding solace in His words, tugged at me. Yet here I was, needed in a different way, torn between offering comfort to someone in pain and fulfilling a spiritual duty that nourished my own soul. The two roles pulled at me, each with its own claim, and I sat there, heart heavy, unsure which path to follow."}
