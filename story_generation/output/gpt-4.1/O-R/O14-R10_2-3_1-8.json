My heart raced with excitement and anxiety; this was the breakthrough I\u2019d been working toward for years. But as I glanced at my phone, a message from my mother reminded me of the upcoming festival. It was the most sacred in our tradition, and this year, my family expected me to travel home and lead the rituals. I could almost hear the temple bells, smell the incense, and feel the warmth of my relatives\u2019 embrace. Yet, the thought of missing the experiment gnawed at me. My lab team counted on my presence, and the data could shape my entire career. I felt torn, pulled by the weight of my family\u2019s faith and the demands of my scientific pursuit. The two worlds I cherished seemed to collide, and I sat frozen, unable to choose, the pressure of both expectations pressing in on me."}
