The foreman\u2019s shout cut through the clamor: \u201cWe need you now! The beam\u2019s swinging!\u201d I dropped my shovel and rushed over, heart pounding as the crane\u2019s cable strained above us. My hands gripped the guide rope, every muscle tense\u2014if I let go, someone could get hurt. But my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was almost time for Jummah. I was the imam, expected to deliver the Khutbah, to stand before the congregation and guide their hearts. The guest speaker was ready, but I knew the community looked to me, especially today. My mind raced: if I left now, the crew would be shorthanded at a critical moment. If I stayed, I\u2019d disappoint those who counted on my words.
