The foreman\u2019s voice booms, \u201cEveryone to the muster point, now!\u201d I know the drill\u2014no exceptions, no delays. As I fall in line with the others, sweat trickling down my back, my phone vibrates in my pocket. A reminder: Shabbat service in two hours. My congregation expects a thoughtful sermon, words of comfort and wisdom. I haven\u2019t finished preparing; my notes are scattered, my mind still tangled in steel beams and concrete. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my team counting on me for safety, my community counting on me for guidance. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, can\u2019t give my all to both. The tension coils in my chest as I shuffle forward, torn between the hard hat on my head and the yarmulke in my heart, not knowing which duty I\u2019ll have to let down."}
