The project deadline loomed, and my manager\u2019s email was clear: we needed documented proof of compliance before the release. I knew the updated regulations inside out, but gathering the evidence and double-checking every detail would take hours. My phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a gentle reminder from my mother about the evening prayer. As a Hindu, I had always set aside time to light the lamp and offer prayers at our home altar, a ritual that brought me peace and connection. But tonight, the demands of my role as an engineer pressed heavily on me. If I paused for my ritual, I risked missing the compliance deadline; if I skipped it, I would feel a deep sense of guilt and disconnection from my faith. The weight of both expectations pressed in, and I found myself torn, staring at the clock, heart pounding, unsure which part of myself to honor."}
