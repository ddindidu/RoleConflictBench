The deadline for the online module was fast approaching, and I knew I had to stay updated to maintain my license and serve my patients well. My phone buzzed\u2014a message from Mary, a parishioner. She wondered if I might have time to talk, not urgently, but soon. I could sense the weight behind her words; she rarely reached out unless something was truly troubling her. As a priest, I was expected to be available, to offer comfort and guidance whenever my flock needed it. But as a pharmacist, I was expected to be diligent, to keep up with the ever-changing world of medicine. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding my time and heart. I stared at the message, feeling the tension coil in my chest, torn between the call to heal bodies and the call to heal souls, unsure which path to take first."}
