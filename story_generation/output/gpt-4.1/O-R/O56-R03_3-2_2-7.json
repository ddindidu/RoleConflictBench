I put on my warmest smile, ushering them to their seats, offering tea, and listening to their anxious chatter about the schedule. My hands moved automatically, sectioning hair, but my mind was elsewhere. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a message from Sister Agnes: a parishioner needed to see me, urgently, about a crisis of faith. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and guidance. But as a hairdresser, I was expected to stay, to calm the bride, to make her feel beautiful and cared for on her big day.
