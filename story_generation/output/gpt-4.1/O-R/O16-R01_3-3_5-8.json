As a doctor, I was expected to meet the family waiting outside, to explain with clarity and compassion that their loved one\u2019s condition was grave. I could already hear their muffled sobs through the door, and I knew they would look to me for hope, for answers, for comfort. My heart ached, knowing my words would shatter their world.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with reminders from the church. As a pastor, I was supposed to be leading an intensive workshop for community leaders in less than an hour. They were counting on me to guide them through challenging theological concepts, to inspire and teach, to be present and focused. I could not let them down; they had prepared for weeks.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both callings pressing on my chest. My mind raced with the expectations of each role\u2014healer and shepherd, scientist and spiritual guide. I stared at the closed door, then at my phone, feeling the impossible pull in both directions, unsure which path to take."}
