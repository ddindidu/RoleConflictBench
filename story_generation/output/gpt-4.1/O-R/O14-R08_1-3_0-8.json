The equipment was finally available, and the next slot to run the tests was just days away. My supervisor expected me to seize this opportunity, to push our research forward and gather the data we needed. Yet, as I looked at the dates, my heart tightened. They overlapped with the window for Hajj, the pilgrimage I\u2019d dreamed of making since childhood. My doctor\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014this might be my last chance to travel so far, given my health. My family urged me to go, reminding me of the spiritual importance and the duty I held as a Muslim. I felt torn, the weight of scientific responsibility pressing against the deep longing and obligation to fulfill my faith. I sat in silence, caught between the sterile promise of the lab and the sacred call of Mecca, unsure which path to follow."}
