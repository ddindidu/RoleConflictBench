She glared at her reflection, her voice rising with every complaint about the cut. I could feel the eyes of my coworkers on me, silently urging me to resolve the situation quickly so we could all go home. But tonight wasn\u2019t just any night\u2014I was scheduled to chant a Torah portion at synagogue, something I\u2019d practiced for weeks. The service would start soon, and I knew the congregation was counting on me. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of the time, and my heart pounded with guilt. I wanted to give my client the attention she deserved, to fix her hair and send her home happy, but I also felt the weight of my commitment to my faith and community. Torn between my professional duty and my religious responsibility, I stood frozen, caught in the impossible space between two worlds that both needed me, right now."}
