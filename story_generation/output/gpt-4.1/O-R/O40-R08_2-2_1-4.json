The office function was in two hours, and I still had to finish up on site. As a carpenter, I knew the rules: keep the workspace clean, wear the right gear, and always put safety first. My overalls and short-sleeved shirt were standard\u2014practical, sturdy, but not exactly modest by Islamic standards. I felt the familiar tug of discomfort as I thought about the function. My colleagues would all be there, men and women together, and I was expected to join, to be part of the team.\n\nBut as a Muslim, I was also expected to dress modestly, to cover my arms and legs, especially in mixed company. I imagined myself walking into the function in my work clothes, feeling exposed and out of place, but if I changed into something more modest, would it be safe for the rest of my shift? Would I be able to work efficiently, or would I be risking an accident? The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood in the middle, heart pounding, unsure which part of myself I could afford to let down."}
