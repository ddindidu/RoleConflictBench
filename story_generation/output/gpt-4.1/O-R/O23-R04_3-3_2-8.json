My client\u2019s future hinged on my ability to spot any hidden traps\u2014one overlooked clause could mean financial disaster. The pressure was immense; I knew I had to review every word before the deadline tonight. Just as I began to analyze a particularly tricky section, my phone buzzed. It was the mosque\u2019s caretaker.
