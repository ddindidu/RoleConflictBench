As an accountant, I knew the gravity of a letter from the tax authority\u2014every minute counted, and a delayed response could mean penalties for my client. My mind raced through spreadsheets and regulations, searching for the source of the discrepancy. Just then, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the community gathering was about to start. As a pastor, I was expected to share a message of hope, to guide my congregation with wisdom and faith. I had planned to mention a story about honesty and integrity, a lesson I believed they needed. But now, the urgency of the tax issue gnawed at me. If I left it unresolved, I risked failing my client and my professional duty. If I ignored my pastoral role, I would let down people who looked to me for spiritual guidance. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014compliance and truth on one side, faith and teaching on the other. I stared at the clock, torn between two worlds, feeling the pressure mount with every passing second."}
