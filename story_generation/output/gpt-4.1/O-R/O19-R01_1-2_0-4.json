The label matched, the dosage was correct\u2014my mind ticked through the checklist, as it always did. Accuracy was everything here; one mistake could mean real harm. Just as I was about to call her name, I saw Mr. Carter waiting by the chairs, his eyes red and tired. He was a regular at church, and I knew his family was going through a rough patch. As his pastor, I felt the weight of his silent plea for comfort, for someone to listen and offer hope. But as a pharmacist, I couldn\u2019t leave my post or let my focus slip, not even for a moment. The line behind him grew, and the phone rang with another doctor\u2019s call. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the duty of care behind the counter, and the call to shepherd a hurting soul. I gripped the prescription bag, feeling the pressure of both worlds pressing in, unsure which voice to answer first."}
