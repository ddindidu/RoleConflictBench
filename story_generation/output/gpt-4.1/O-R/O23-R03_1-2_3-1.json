The phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of the procedural hearing scheduled for this afternoon. It was a minor matter, one that could easily be postponed, but my client expected me to be there, to represent them with the diligence and reliability I promised. As I reached for my briefcase, Sister Maria burst into my office, her face flushed with urgency. \u201cThe Johnsons\u2019 house caught fire last night. They have nothing left. We\u2019re gathering food and clothes for them now. Can you help?\u201d\n\nMy heart twisted. As a nun, I was called to serve, to be present for those in need, especially in moments of crisis. The community looked to me for compassion and action. Yet, as a lawyer, I was bound by duty to my client, to the court, to the profession I had chosen. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, each demanding my presence, each justified in its own way. I stood frozen, torn between the courtroom and the charred remains of the Johnsons\u2019 home, feeling the impossible pull of both worlds."}
