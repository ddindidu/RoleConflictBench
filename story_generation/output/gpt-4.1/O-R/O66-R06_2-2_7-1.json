As a taxi driver, I knew I was expected to help them load their bags and provide a smooth, professional ride. They smiled gratefully, explaining they wanted to split the fare to save money. I nodded, already calculating the best route and how to handle the payment. But as I opened the trunk, I overheard them quietly discussing how they planned to mislead me about their destination to pay less. My heart tightened. As a Christian, I\u2019m called to act with honesty and encourage others to do the same. I felt a knot in my stomach\u2014should I confront them, risking my tip and their goodwill, or just do my job and ignore their plan? The weight of my two roles pressed on me: the professional driver expected to serve without judgment, and the Christian compelled to stand for truth. I stood by the open trunk, wrestling with what to do next."}
