It was a quiet shift, and I was grateful for the calm. As a taxi driver, I always made sure to follow every traffic law, keeping my passengers safe and my record clean. That\u2019s what was expected of me\u2014no shortcuts, no risks, just steady, defensive driving.\n\nThen, I saw her. An elderly woman, standing at the curb, waving frantically. As I pulled over, she explained through tears that her husband had collapsed at home, and she needed to get there as quickly as possible. My heart ached for her. As a Christian, I knew I was called to show love and compassion, to help those in need, just as Jesus taught. But the fastest route meant pushing the speed limit, maybe even running a red light or two. The rules of the road pressed on me from one side, while the call to love and help pressed from the other. My hands tightened on the wheel as I wrestled with what to do next."}
