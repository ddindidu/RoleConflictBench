My mind was focused, every word measured, when my clerk slipped me a note\u2014urgent, trembling. The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was explaining. My heart pounded. I knew I had to stop, reassess, and ensure the law was followed precisely. The courtroom waited, eyes on me, expecting clarity and authority.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket. The church council was waiting for me to lead the workshop I\u2019d promised, a deep dive into theological principles that required my full attention and presence.
