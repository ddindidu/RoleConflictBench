As a delivery person, I knew I had to greet the customer with a smile, speak politely, and make sure the handover went smoothly. But as I waited, I felt the familiar urge to repeat my daily mantra\u2014a quiet thread of devotion I tried to weave through my busy days as a Hindu. I whispered the sacred words under my breath, hoping to find a moment of peace before the door opened. Suddenly, the customer appeared, looking impatient. I caught myself mid-chant, my lips still moving. I worried they might notice, might think I was talking to myself or being unprofessional. My mind raced: should I finish my mantra, honoring my faith, or stop abruptly to meet the customer\u2019s expectations? The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding something different in this small, ordinary moment."}
