The bride-to-be and her entourage bustled in, their faces tight with worry. I smiled, welcoming them, trying to project calm and warmth. They needed reassurance, gentle conversation, and a steady hand\u2014everything a good hairdresser should offer, especially on a day like this. But my mind kept drifting to the meditation room down the hall, where my Buddhist group would soon gather. As the leader, I was expected to guide them in mindfulness, to be present and centered, to help others find peace. The two roles pulled at me\u2014one demanding outward energy and constant attention, the other requiring inward stillness and focus. I felt my breath catch, my heart torn between the anxious chatter of the bridal party and the silent expectation of my fellow practitioners. Both needed me, but in such different ways. I stood there, scissors in hand, caught between the noise of the salon and the quiet waiting just beyond its walls."}
