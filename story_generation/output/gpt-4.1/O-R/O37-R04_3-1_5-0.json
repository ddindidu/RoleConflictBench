My checklist was clear: today, the oven needed a deep scrub, and nothing else would do. I felt the pressure of my housekeeping duties\u2014my client trusted me to keep their home spotless, to never run out of supplies, to always be prepared. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. It was nearly time for the midday prayer at the mosque, and as the imam, I was expected to lead. The congregation was small today, and another brother could step in, but I knew the community valued my presence and guidance. I could almost hear the echo of their expectations, the weight of their trust. My mind raced: should I rush out to buy the cleaner, risking being late for prayer, or should I leave the cleaning incomplete and fulfill my spiritual duty? The demands of both roles pulled at me, each one urgent in its own way. I stood frozen, torn between the mop and the prayer mat, feeling the strain of being needed in two places at once."}
