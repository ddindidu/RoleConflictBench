As an architect, I knew every inch mattered\u2014each wall, each window, every line had to serve a purpose. I wanted the space to be functional, efficient, a place where I could work and create without distraction. The deadline for the design was tight, and I felt the pressure to get it right.\n\nBut as I measured and erased, my phone buzzed with a reminder: Sunday worship at church. I hadn\u2019t been in weeks, always telling myself I\u2019d go when I had more time. My faith was important to me, and I missed the sense of community, the peace I felt during worship. I knew my church expected me to be present, to participate, to give back.\n\nI stared at my unfinished sketch, then at the clock. The demands of my profession pulled me one way, the call of my faith another. My heart ached with the tension, torn between the work I loved and the worship I needed."}
