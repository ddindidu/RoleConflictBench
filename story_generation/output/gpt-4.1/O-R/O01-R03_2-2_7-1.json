The project was already behind schedule, and I was expected to coordinate a site visit this afternoon to resolve a critical issue. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford another delay.\u201d As an architect, I knew the importance of keeping everything on track, of being present and decisive.\n\nBut then Sister Maria knocked gently on my door. \u201cThe family next door lost everything in the fire last night,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWe\u2019re gathering food and clothing for them. Can you help us deliver supplies and comfort them?\u201d As a nun, I was expected to serve, to be present for those in need, especially in moments of crisis.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions.
