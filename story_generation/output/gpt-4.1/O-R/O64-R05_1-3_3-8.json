Store policy is clear: every cent must be accounted for, no matter how minor. I\u2019m supposed to report it, fill out the paperwork, and wait for the manager to review the drawer. But as I\u2019m about to start, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from the synagogue board: a beloved congregant has passed away, and the family needs me to officiate the funeral as soon as possible. My heart aches for them; as their rabbi, I know how much my presence and guidance will mean in this moment of grief. Yet, I\u2019m still on shift, bound by the store\u2019s rules and the expectation to be a diligent cashier. I feel the weight of both uniforms pressing on me, the apron and the tallit, each demanding my full attention. My mind races, torn between the duty to my employer and the sacred responsibility to my community."}
