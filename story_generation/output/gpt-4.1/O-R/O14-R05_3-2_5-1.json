The journal\u2019s submission portal blinks at me, a silent reminder that my research report and datasets must be uploaded by midnight. Every detail must be precise, every finding transparent\u2014my reputation as a scientist depends on it. Yet, my phone vibrates with messages from congregants, asking about the Shabbat service. I haven\u2019t even begun to prepare my sermon, and the sun will set soon. As a rabbi, my community expects inspiration, guidance, and presence. I feel the weight of their anticipation, knowing how much they rely on my words each week. My mind races, torn between the integrity of my scientific work and the spiritual nourishment my congregation seeks. The clock ticks louder, and my heart pounds as I wrestle with the impossible demands of both worlds, knowing I cannot give my all to both at once."}
