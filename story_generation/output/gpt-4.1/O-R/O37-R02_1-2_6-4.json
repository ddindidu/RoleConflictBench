As a housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to follow every safety and hygiene protocol, but sometimes, when the rush of the day pressed in, I skipped the gloves for smaller tasks. Today, though, I wore them, scrubbing the bathroom tiles, my mind already drifting to the appointment I had in an hour. As a priest, I was supposed to offer comfort and guidance, to be present and open for those who needed me. But what if the residue of bleach lingered on my hands, or worse, if I brought some unseen germ into the quiet sanctuary where someone would bare their soul to me? I worried about being careless, about failing in my duty to keep things clean, but also about being distracted or distant when someone needed my full attention. The clock ticked closer to the meeting, and I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014one of service, one of solace\u2014pressing down on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
