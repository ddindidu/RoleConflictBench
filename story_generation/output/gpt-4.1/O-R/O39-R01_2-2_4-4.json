My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cKeep the site safe, no shortcuts.\u201d I knew I had to clean it up right away\u2014one slip could mean a broken bone or worse. As I reached for the mop, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Maria, a member of my congregation. Her message was urgent: \u201cPastor, can you talk? I\u2019m at the gate. It\u2019s about my son. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d I glanced at the spill, then at the gate where I could see her waiting, shoulders slumped, eyes searching for me. My heart twisted. The crew depended on me to keep the site safe, but Maria needed me to listen, to offer hope. I felt torn, the weight of both hard hats pressing down\u2014one caked with dust, the other with the worries of my flock. I stood frozen, mop in hand, caught between the demands of safety and the call to shepherd, unsure which path to take first."}
