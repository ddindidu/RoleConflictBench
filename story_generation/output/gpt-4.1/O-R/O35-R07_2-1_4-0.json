My training as a subway operator kicked in\u2014protocol demanded I stop the train, alert security, and keep passengers calm. My heart pounded, knowing every second mattered for their safety. But tonight was also the temple\u2019s evening chant, a ritual I rarely missed. As a Buddhist, I was expected to be present, to join the community in reciting sutras, cultivating peace and mindfulness. The abbot had reminded me earlier of the importance of showing up, of supporting others in their practice. Now, I felt torn\u2014my duty to protect these passengers clashed with my commitment to the sangha. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, my mind racing between the emergency at hand and the quiet sanctuary waiting for me. I gripped the radio, feeling the strain of being pulled in two directions, uncertain which call to answer first."}
