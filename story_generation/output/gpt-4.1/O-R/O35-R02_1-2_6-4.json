My phone buzzed with an email from the transit authority\u2014an optional sign-up for a professional development seminar. They encouraged us to participate, to show commitment to our roles and keep up with the latest safety protocols. I knew my supervisor would notice who responded promptly. As I started to draft my reply, my other phone vibrated. It was a reminder: Mrs. Kim, a member of my congregation, was arriving soon for her appointment. She\u2019d confided in me last Sunday about her ongoing struggle with loneliness, and I\u2019d promised to listen, to be present for her. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding my professional diligence, the other my compassion and presence. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, my mind torn between the expectations of my uniform and my collar, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both my full attention at the same time."}
