She smiles, but then hesitates, her fingers brushing her forehead. \u201cCould you just trim a little more? I\u2019m sorry, I know you\u2019re closing soon.\u201d Her voice is gentle, and I want to reassure her\u2014she\u2019s been coming here for years, always kind, always grateful. I nod, but my mind is already racing. The study circle meets in less than an hour, and I haven\u2019t read the chapter yet. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to come prepared, to reflect deeply and contribute thoughtfully. I promised myself I\u2019d never let work interfere with my practice, but here I am, scissors in hand, torn between my client\u2019s trust and my own commitment to spiritual growth. My heart pounds with guilt and frustration. If I rush, I risk disappointing her; if I stay, I\u2019ll arrive unprepared, letting down my teacher and fellow practitioners. I force a smile, but inside, I\u2019m wrestling with the weight of both worlds, unsure which path to honor."}
