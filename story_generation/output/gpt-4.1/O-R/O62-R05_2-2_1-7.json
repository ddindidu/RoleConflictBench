The pool was busy, laughter echoing off the tiles, but my mind kept drifting to the synagogue. In less than an hour, I was supposed to stand before a congregation, guiding a young boy through his bar mitzvah\u2014a moment his family had anticipated for months. My phone buzzed with a reminder, and my heart thudded. I couldn\u2019t leave the pool unattended; every parent trusted me to keep their children safe. Suddenly, I spotted a swimmer flailing near the middle, their strokes growing frantic. My training screamed at me to stay alert, to be ready to dive in at any second. But the clock was ticking, and I knew the congregation would be waiting, expecting me to lead them in prayer and celebration. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to yield. I gripped the armrests, torn between the sacred duty of saving lives and the sacred duty of guiding souls."}
