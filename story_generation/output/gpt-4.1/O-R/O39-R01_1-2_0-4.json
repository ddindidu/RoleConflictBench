My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cMake sure those unused bricks are moved to the back lot before you clock out.\u201d I nodded, knowing the job had to be done, but my arms already ached from the morning\u2019s work. As I set the bag down, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Maria from church, her voice trembling. \u201cPastor, I really need to talk. It\u2019s about my son\u2014he\u2019s in trouble again. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d I could hear the desperation in her voice, the kind that couldn\u2019t wait. My heart twisted. I wanted to be there for her, to offer the comfort and guidance she expected from me. But the bricks still sat in a neat stack, waiting for me, and I knew the supervisor would check. I stared at the pile, torn between the weight of my laborer\u2019s duty and the pull of my calling as a pastor, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
