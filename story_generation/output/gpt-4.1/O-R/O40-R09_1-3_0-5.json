The foreman\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cBe on time, follow every safety rule\u2014no exceptions.\u201d I took pride in my work, in the careful way I measured and cut, always alert to the dangers around me. Today, though, there was a communal lunch for the crew, a rare treat. As I glanced at the spread, my heart sank. None of the food was kosher, and there was no way to substitute or prepare my own meal. My stomach grumbled, but the thought of breaking my dietary laws made me uneasy. The foreman called everyone over, urging us to eat quickly so we could get back to work on schedule. If I hesitated, I\u2019d risk being late and possibly endangering myself or others by rushing. But if I ate, I\u2019d be betraying a core part of my faith. I stood there, torn, the expectations of my job and my beliefs pulling me in opposite directions."}
