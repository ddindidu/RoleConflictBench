The architects from the other teams are waiting for my input on the new feature design, and the launch date has just been moved up. My manager\u2019s message is clear: \u201cWe need your decisions tonight, or the whole project stalls.\u201d My mind races with technical details, dependencies, and the pressure of letting everyone down if I don\u2019t deliver.\n\nBut tonight is also the memorial service at the temple. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to be there, to chant and support the community, especially since so many are grieving. The abbot called earlier, gently reminding me how important my presence is. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my colleagues\u2019 anxious expectations on one side, my sangha\u2019s quiet need on the other. My heart aches with the impossibility of being in two places at once, torn between the urgent demands of my work and the deep call of my spiritual community. I close my eyes, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me, unsure which path to take."}
