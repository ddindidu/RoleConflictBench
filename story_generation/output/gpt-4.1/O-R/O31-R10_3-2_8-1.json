As a Hindu, these moments of prayer are sacred, a time to connect with the divine and seek guidance for the day ahead. But just as I was about to light the lamp, my phone buzzed with a message from the station: I was needed in court immediately to provide testimony in a critical case. As a police officer, I am sworn to act with integrity and fairness, and my presence in court could mean justice for someone waiting desperately for the truth to be heard. Yet, the thought of leaving my ritual incomplete gnawed at me. My family expects me to uphold our traditions, and I feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me. The clock ticks, and I stand frozen, torn between my duty to the law and my devotion to my faith, unsure which path to choose."}
