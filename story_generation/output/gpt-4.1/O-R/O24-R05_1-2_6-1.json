As a judge, I know I must stay current, not just for my own edification but to ensure my rulings reflect the most up-to-date interpretations of the law. Yet, as I reach for the journal, my phone buzzes with a reminder: Shabbat is approaching, and I have not yet prepared my sermon. My congregation expects guidance, wisdom, and comfort\u2014words that require careful thought and spiritual reflection. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in on me. The law demands my intellectual rigor; my faith community needs my heart and presence. I glance at the clock, calculating how much time I can devote to each task, knowing that to do either well requires my full attention. My mind races, torn between the pursuit of legal knowledge and the call to spiritual leadership, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
