As a pastor, I had just listened to a parishioner pour out their heart, teetering on the edge of a life-altering decision, searching my eyes for spiritual guidance. I wanted to stay, to offer comfort and prayer, but the dispatcher\u2019s urgent call had come in\u2014a woman had fallen, her arm likely broken, and I was the closest ambulance driver on shift. Now, as I pulled up to the scene, I could feel the weight of both uniforms pressing on me. The woman\u2019s pain was immediate and physical; she needed my steady hands and calm instructions. Yet, my thoughts kept drifting back to the church office, to the soul in crisis, waiting for my counsel. I felt torn, the expectations of healer and shepherd pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I reached for the medical kit, caught between the needs of the body and the needs of the spirit, unsure which call to answer first."}
