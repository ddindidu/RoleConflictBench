I had been whispering the Gayatri mantra under my breath, a small act of devotion squeezed between calibrations and data entries. The lab was empty except for me, and the warning lights on the equipment flashed an urgent red. My training as a scientist demanded immediate action\u2014protocols were clear: check the seals, shut down the system, document everything. But I hadn\u2019t finished my morning ritual, the one my mother insisted kept our family safe. I felt the weight of her expectations, the echo of her voice reminding me that even a shortened prayer was not enough. My hands hovered over the emergency shutoff, my mind torn between the sacred and the scientific. The mantra faltered on my lips as I stared at the blinking console, heart pounding, caught between the duty to my faith and the responsibility to my profession."}
