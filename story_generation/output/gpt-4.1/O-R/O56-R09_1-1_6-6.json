My training as a hairdresser echoed in my mind: always wash and condition before cutting, to ensure the best results and maintain salon standards. But her hair was spotless, and she looked uncomfortable at the thought of another wash.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder for tonight\u2019s synagogue service. As a Jew, I\u2019m expected to attend regularly, to be present in the community, even though I know the minyan will be met without me. Still, skipping feels like letting down a tradition that grounds me.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing in. Should I insist on washing her hair, risking her annoyance and my own sense of professionalism? Or should I skip the wash, bending the rules for her comfort? And if I run late, I might miss the service, betraying my commitment to my faith. My hands hovered over the sink, my mind tangled in the expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
