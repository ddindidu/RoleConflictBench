As an engineer, I knew the importance of keeping every safety document up to date, especially with the routine audit scheduled in a few weeks. There was time, but the standards were strict, and I prided myself on never leaving things to the last minute. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the train to my hometown left in two hours. The festival was one of the most important in my family\u2019s tradition, and as the eldest, I was expected to lead the rituals and help with the offerings. My parents had already called twice, reminding me to bring the special incense and to arrive before the evening prayers. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me\u2014my professional responsibility to ensure everything at work was flawless, and my spiritual duty to honor my heritage and family. My mind raced, torn between the quiet order of my engineering role and the vibrant, communal demands of my faith. I sat at my desk, heart pounding, unable to decide which expectation to meet first."}
