My phone buzzed with an email from management: a professional development seminar next month, optional but \u201cstrongly encouraged.\u201d I knew these seminars often included catered lunches\u2014last time, nothing was kosher, and I\u2019d quietly nibbled on a granola bar while my colleagues chatted over sandwiches. I glanced at the pantry, grateful for the kosher snacks I\u2019d stashed there, but the thought of another awkward lunch gnawed at me. As a subway operator, I\u2019m expected to be a team player, to show initiative and commitment by attending these events. But as a Jew, I\u2019m expected to honor my dietary laws, even if it means standing out. My supervisor would expect a prompt RSVP, and I could already imagine the subtle disappointment if I declined. I stared at the email, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I could afford to let down."}
