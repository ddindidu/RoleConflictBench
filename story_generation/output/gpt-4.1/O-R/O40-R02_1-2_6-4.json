She placed the toy in my hands, explaining how her son had cried all night after it broke. She needed a repair quote by noon, she said, so she could decide whether to fix it or buy a new one. I nodded, feeling the weight of her hope, and promised to look at it right away.\n\nBut as she left, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that Mr. Evans would arrive at the rectory in fifteen minutes. He\u2019d confided in me last Sunday, his voice trembling, about a struggle that had left him sleepless and desperate for guidance. He was counting on me, not as a craftsman, but as a priest, to help him find peace.\n\nI stared at the broken toy in my hands, the clock ticking louder with each passing second. Both needed me now, in different ways. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to mend what was broken in wood, and the call to heal what was broken in spirit."}
