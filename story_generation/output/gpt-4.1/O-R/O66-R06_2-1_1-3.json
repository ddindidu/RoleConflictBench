I knew the route, knew the traffic, and knew it would be a challenge even if I pushed the speed limit. As a taxi driver, I felt the pressure to get him there safely and on time\u2014my job depended on it, and I took pride in helping people reach their destinations.\n\nBut today was Sunday morning. The church bells would soon ring, calling the congregation to worship. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d attend more regularly, to be present in the community and honor my faith. Missing another service weighed on me; I could already imagine the empty pew where I should be sitting, the hymns I\u2019d miss singing, the prayers I\u2019d skip. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to my passenger and the commitment to my faith. As I gripped the steering wheel, I felt the tension rise, unsure which road I would choose."}
