You people always say it\u2019s the best deal, but I\u2019ve been burned before!\u201d My script urged me to stay calm, to handle objections, to win him over with patience and clarity. But my mind kept drifting to the church office, where Mrs. Carter waited, her eyes red from tears, desperate for guidance about her crumbling marriage. As a telemarketer, I was expected to be persuasive, unflappable, to turn every call into a sale. As a pastor, I was called to be present, compassionate, to listen deeply and offer wisdom. The clock ticked. Mr. Jenkins demanded answers, his voice rising. My phone buzzed with a message: \u201cShe\u2019s here, and she really needs you.\u201d My heart pounded, torn between the duty to my employer and the calling to my congregation. I gripped the receiver, caught in the impossible space between two worlds, each demanding all of me at once."}
