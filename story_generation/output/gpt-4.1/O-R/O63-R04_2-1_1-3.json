My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cHandle every objection, don\u2019t let them go.\u201d I tried to sound confident, but my answers felt thin, rehearsed. My eyes flicked to the clock. Friday prayers were in less than an hour. As the imam, the community expected me to deliver the Khutbah, to guide and inspire. But today, a guest speaker was ready, waiting in the mosque\u2019s quiet. I could let him take the pulpit, but I knew some congregants would be disappointed, expecting my familiar voice and presence. My heart pounded as I juggled the call, the script, the questions, and the weight of my congregation\u2019s trust. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one demanding professionalism and persistence, the other spiritual leadership and connection. The minutes ticked by, and I sat at my desk, torn, the phone still warm in my hand."}
