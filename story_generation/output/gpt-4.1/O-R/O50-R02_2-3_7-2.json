The operator, young and eager, kept fiddling with the settings, ignoring my earlier advice. Each wrong adjustment sent more material to waste, and I felt the pressure from my supervisor\u2019s expectation to guide him properly. My mind raced with technical explanations, but my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of the evening\u2019s service. Tonight was the most significant religious holiday, and the community would gather, waiting for me to lead them in prayer. I pictured the crowded sanctuary, the hopeful faces, the sacred responsibility I carried as their priest. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds: the operator\u2019s anxious glances, the supervisor\u2019s trust, and the congregation\u2019s faith. I felt torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, each role demanding my full presence, each expectation pulling me apart."}
