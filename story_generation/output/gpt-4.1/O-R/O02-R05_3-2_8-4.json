Client\u2019s waiting.\u201d As the lead engineer, I knew the contract hinged on my numbers\u2014if I didn\u2019t deliver, the whole project could stall. I opened my laptop, spreadsheets ready, but my mind kept drifting to the synagogue. In less than an hour, I was supposed to teach the children\u2019s Torah class, a weekly commitment I\u2019d promised never to miss. Parents and kids counted on me to bring the stories alive, to guide them in their learning. I could picture their expectant faces, the trust in their eyes. But the team at work was just as dependent, and the pressure to be precise was immense. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands: the sacred responsibility to my community, the professional duty to my colleagues. Both roles called to me, each urgent, each important. I sat frozen, torn between two worlds, feeling the weight of expectations pressing in from every side."}
