I force a smile as the next customer slams her basket on the counter, her voice sharp, complaining about the wait. My manager\u2019s eyes flick to me, silently reminding me to stay cheerful, to keep the line moving, to be the calm in the chaos. I nod, apologizing, ringing up her items, my hands steady but my mind racing. At home, my children wait, their voices echoing in my memory\u2014\u201cWhen will you teach us the Hanukkah blessings?\u201d The holiday is days away, and I promised we\u2019d practice together, that I\u2019d share the stories and songs my parents taught me. But every shift runs late, every customer demands more, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. I want to be the patient cashier, the devoted teacher, but right now, I can\u2019t see how to be both. My heart aches as I hand the customer her change, wondering which expectation I\u2019ll have to let down."}
