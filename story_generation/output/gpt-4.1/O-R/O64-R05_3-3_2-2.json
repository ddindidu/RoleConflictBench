It was nearly closing time, and the drawer was heavy with the day\u2019s high-value transactions. I knew I had to count every bill and coin with absolute precision\u2014one mistake, and the numbers wouldn\u2019t add up, causing headaches for my manager and myself. But as I handed a customer their change, my mind drifted to the sermon I still hadn\u2019t finished. The High Holiday service was tomorrow, and the congregation would be looking to me for guidance, inspiration, and comfort. I could almost hear their voices, see their expectant faces. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds: the demand for accuracy at the register, and the spiritual responsibility waiting for me at the synagogue. I felt torn, my hands trembling as I tried to focus on the cash, while my thoughts raced with unfinished lines of my sermon. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood there, caught between the numbers in my till and the words I needed to find."}
