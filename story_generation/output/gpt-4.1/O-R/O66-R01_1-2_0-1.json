The city lights flickered past as I navigated the familiar streets, my mind only half on the road. My phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. \u201cPastor, I really need to talk. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d I could almost hear the tremor in her voice, the weight of her decision pressing on her. As a taxi driver, my duty was clear: get my passenger to his destination safely and on time, even if he wasn\u2019t in a rush. But as a pastor, I felt the pull to be present for Sarah, to offer her the guidance she desperately needed. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, heart pounding with the pressure of both roles. Should I pull over and call her, risking my passenger\u2019s expectations? Or should I focus on the road, knowing someone\u2019s spiritual crisis was unfolding without me? The city hummed around me, but inside, I was caught between two worlds, each demanding more than I felt able to give."}
