My code\u2014my responsibility\u2014was at the center of it all. The team\u2019s messages pinged urgently, asking for a fix before the system buckled under the holiday traffic. I knew what was expected: clean, efficient code, and a quick resolution. But as I typed, the church bells outside reminded me of another duty. Today was the most significant religious holiday of the year, and the sanctuary would soon fill with people seeking guidance, comfort, and tradition. They expected me to lead prayers, to be present, to embody calm and faith. My phone buzzed with a reminder: service begins in thirty minutes. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my congregation waiting in the pews, my colleagues waiting on Slack. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the code that needed fixing and the altar that needed me."}
