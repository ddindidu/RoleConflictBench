As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce every safety rule, no exceptions. Lately, swimmers had been slipping into the shallow end without supervision, laughing and splashing, ignoring the posted signs. My duty was clear: intervene, remind them of the rules, keep everyone safe. But my mind kept drifting to the convent, where the Mother Superior had just asked me to lead daily reflections for the retreat. As a nun, I was expected to devote myself to spiritual study, to guide my sisters in prayer and contemplation. The retreat was only days away, and I hadn\u2019t prepared a single reflection. Guilt gnawed at me\u2014how could I focus on spiritual leadership when my attention was divided by the constant vigilance required here? Yet, if I neglected my lifeguard duties, someone could get hurt. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full presence, each unforgiving of distraction. I watched another swimmer slip into the shallow end, my heart pounding as I wrestled with what to do next."}
