The deadline for filing was tomorrow, and my client was counting on me to catch every loophole, every hidden clause. My phone buzzed with a message from a colleague: a reminder of the corruption I\u2019d witnessed earlier that day\u2014an executive quietly approving a bribe to secure the deal. As a lawyer, my duty was clear: focus on the documents, ensure my client\u2019s interests were protected, and meet the deadline. But as a Hindu, raised to uphold dharma and truth, I felt a deep unease. My conscience screamed at me to act, to report the wrongdoing, to refuse to be complicit. Yet, the professional expectation was to remain silent, to do my job and nothing more. My hands trembled as I tried to focus on the contract, but the weight of my values pressed down on me. I stared at the agreement, torn between my role as a diligent lawyer and my responsibility as a moral human being."}
