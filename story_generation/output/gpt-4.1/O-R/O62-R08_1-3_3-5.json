As I walked past the pool, I noticed a few chairs out of place\u2014nothing major, but I knew the facility expected us to keep everything orderly. I glanced at my watch; Friday prayers would start soon, and I needed to change into my modest clothes before heading to the mosque. The expectation to maintain the pool area tugged at me, but so did the responsibility to dress appropriately and arrive on time for Jumu\u2019ah. My uniform, a short-sleeved shirt and shorts, was far from suitable for the prayer hall. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one demanding immediate attention to detail, the other calling me to spiritual discipline and community. My heart pounded as I stood between the pool and the locker room, torn by the conflicting demands of duty and faith, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
