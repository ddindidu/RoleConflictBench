As a judge, I know I must stay current\u2014my rulings depend on it. Yet, my phone vibrates with a message from the church secretary: a member of my congregation is waiting in my office, desperate for guidance. Their life is at a crossroads, and they need me not as a judge, but as a pastor, to help them find clarity and hope. I glance at the journal, feeling the weight of my duty to the law, then at the door, where someone\u2019s faith and future hang in the balance. My mind races, torn between the intellectual demands of my judicial role and the compassionate presence required of a pastor. Both expect my full attention, both are urgent, and I feel the tension coil inside me as I stand, uncertain which part of myself to answer first."}
