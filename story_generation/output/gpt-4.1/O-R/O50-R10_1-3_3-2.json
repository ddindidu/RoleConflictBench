As the lead machine repairer, everyone expected me to oversee the cleaning and servicing\u2014no shortcuts, no delays. The machines had to be spotless, every bolt checked, every filter replaced. It was my responsibility to keep the factory running smoothly, and I took pride in that.\n\nBut next week was also special in my Hindu calendar. My daily rituals would be longer and more elaborate, with extra prayers, chanting, and offerings. I had promised myself and my family that I would not skip a single step, not even for a day. The thought of missing a ritual filled me with guilt and anxiety; my faith was the anchor of my life.\n\nAs the days drew closer, I felt the pressure mounting. My supervisor reminded me of the importance of the shutdown, while my mother gently placed the prayer schedule on my bedside table. I lay awake at night, torn between the demands of my work and the sacred rhythm of my faith, unsure how I could possibly honor both."}
