My headset itched against my veil, a constant reminder of the double life I led. Management\u2019s emails echoed in my mind: \u201cNumbers matter. Every call counts.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my thoughts drifted to the chapel. The Mother Superior had just asked me to lead daily reflections for the retreat next week. She trusted me to guide the sisters in spiritual study, to be present, thoughtful, and prepared. But how could I find the time for prayer and reflection when every minute was a race to meet quotas?
