The doctor had just left, and the news was heavy\u2014her cancer had returned. As a nursing assistant, I knew my role was to offer comfort, to be present, to listen. I wanted to hold her hand, to reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone. But as a Christian, I also felt the urge to share words of faith, to remind her of God\u2019s love and the hope that comes from belief. Yet, I hesitated. Was it right to bring up my faith in this vulnerable moment, especially if she didn\u2019t share it? My heart ached with the desire to help, but I worried about crossing a line, about imposing my beliefs when she needed empathy, not evangelism. The expectations of my job and my faith seemed to pull me in different directions, and I stood there, torn, unsure of what to say or do next."}
