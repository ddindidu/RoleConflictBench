I knew they\u2019d missed their last service window, and the supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a breakdown, not today.\u201d My toolbox felt heavier than ever as I knelt beside the first machine, already running through the steps of cleaning and maintenance in my head. But just as I reached for the wrench, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the community gathering I\u2019d promised to attend as pastor. I was supposed to share a story about compassion, to teach and inspire, and I knew people were counting on me.

I felt torn, knowing that whichever path I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
