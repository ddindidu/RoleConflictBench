The client wanted the floor plan finalized by Monday, and I knew every detail mattered\u2014each workspace needed to be efficient, comfortable, and inspiring. My phone buzzed with a reminder: Sunday service at 10 a.m., followed by the monthly church community lunch. As a Christian, I was expected to be there, not just to worship but to help organize the event and support my church family. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. If I spent Sunday at church, I\u2019d lose precious hours needed to perfect the design. But if I skipped, I\u2019d disappoint my pastor and friends, and feel like I was neglecting my faith. My mind raced, torn between my commitment to my profession and my devotion to my church. The clock ticked on, and I stared at the plans, my heart heavy with the impossible choice looming ahead."}
