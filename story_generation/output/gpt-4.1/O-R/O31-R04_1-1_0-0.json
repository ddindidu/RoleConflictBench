Can you respond?\u201d I glanced at my watch\u2014just fifteen minutes until I was supposed to lead the Isha prayer. As a police officer, I knew the neighbors depended on me to keep the peace, especially on nights like this when tempers could flare. But as the imam, I was expected to guide the congregation, even if tonight\u2019s group would be small and another brother could step in. My uniform felt heavier than usual, the badge pressing against my chest as if reminding me of my duty to the city. Yet, the thought of disappointing the few who came to the mosque, seeking comfort and guidance, gnawed at me. I could picture their faces, waiting for me to begin the prayer, trusting in my presence. The patrol car keys felt cold in my hand, and I stood frozen, torn between the call of the siren and the call to prayer, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
