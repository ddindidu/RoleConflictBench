The deadline for filing was tomorrow, and I still had pages to review, clauses to analyze, and risks to assess. My phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation. Her husband had been laid off, and she was struggling. She didn\u2019t ask for much\u2014just a kind word, a listening ear. As a pastor, I knew how much those small gestures mattered, how a simple call could lift someone\u2019s spirit. But as a lawyer, I couldn\u2019t afford distractions; missing a detail could cost my client dearly. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the duty of care for my client, and the compassion I owed my community. I stared at the phone, then back at the contract, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding more than I felt able to give."}
