As the machine repairer, everyone expected me to diagnose the sensor errors quickly and get the line running again. I hurried past the loading dock, toolbox in hand, but the sound of drums and laughter drifted in from the street. Through the open gate, I glimpsed bright marigold garlands and the swirl of saris. Today was the local festival, and as a Hindu, I was expected to join the rituals, offer prayers, and celebrate with my community. For a moment, I paused, watching the puja in progress, feeling the pull of tradition and belonging. But behind me, the factory\u2019s silence pressed in, a reminder of the team waiting for me to fix the problem. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds\u2014my duty to my work, and my devotion to my faith\u2014each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
