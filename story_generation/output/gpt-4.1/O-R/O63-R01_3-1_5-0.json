Management\u2019s emails echoed in my mind\u2014reminders of the sales target we had to hit or risk losing our bonuses. My fingers hovered over the dial, rehearsing the pitch I\u2019d delivered a hundred times. Just then, my phone buzzed with a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. \u201cCan we talk? I\u2019m struggling,\u201d she wrote. As her pastor, I knew she needed more than a quick reply; she needed comfort, a listening ear, maybe even a prayer. But every minute spent with her meant one less call, one less chance to meet my quota. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the numbers that defined my job and the soul who needed my guidance. I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which voice to answer first."}
