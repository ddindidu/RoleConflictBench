They were about to start a batch, but I could see from their confusion that they hadn\u2019t grasped the safety protocols I\u2019d explained earlier. My duty as a machine repairer was clear: I needed to step in, guide them, and prevent a potential accident. But just as I moved toward them, I caught sight of Mrs. Evans sitting alone by the break room window, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs. As her pastor, I knew she\u2019d been struggling since her husband\u2019s diagnosis, and I\u2019d promised to be there for her, to offer comfort and prayer whenever she needed it. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding immediate action to ensure safety, the other calling for compassion and presence. My heart pounded as I stood between the humming machines and the quiet sorrow in the corner, torn by the urgency of both needs and the impossibility of being in two places at once."}
