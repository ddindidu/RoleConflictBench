If they aren\u2019t fixed, I\u2019ll have to shut this site down.\u201d My mind raced\u2014production would stop, people could lose their jobs, and the company\u2019s reputation would suffer. My manager pulled me aside, his tone urgent. \u201cWe need this to go smoothly. Just sign off on the paperwork. We\u2019ll fix the issues later.\u201d \n\nBut as a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma\u2014righteousness above all. I had just witnessed a colleague slip the inspector an envelope, a bribe to overlook the safety lapses. My heart pounded. I knew what was expected of me as an engineer: keep the project running, protect my team\u2019s livelihood.

I stood there, torn between my duty to my profession and my deeper duty to truth and ethics, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
