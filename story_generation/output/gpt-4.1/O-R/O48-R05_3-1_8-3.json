As a nursing assistant, I knew my place was by her side, offering comfort and a listening ear after her devastating diagnosis. She had no family nearby, and I was often the one she trusted most. But as I glanced at my watch, I remembered the adult education class I was scheduled to teach in just ten minutes. As a rabbi, I was expected to be present, to guide my community in learning and faith, even if the class was optional. I imagined the small group gathering, waiting for me to open the text and share words of Torah. My mind raced with the weight of both roles\u2014one demanding my compassion in a quiet hospital room, the other calling me to inspire and educate. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides, unsure which need was greater or how to honor both without failing either."}
