The clock ticked closer to noon, the time when I was expected at the church to lead the most significant religious holiday service of the year. My congregation would already be gathering, waiting for me to guide them in prayer and celebration. But here, in this glass-walled room, I was responsible for the safe passage of hundreds of lives. An aircraft was approaching the boundary, ready to cross into the neighboring sector. I needed to coordinate with the next controller, ensure the handoff was smooth, avoid any confusion or delay. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cService begins in 15 minutes.\u201d My heart pounded. I could picture the expectant faces at the church, the disappointment if I failed them. Yet, if I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning my post, risking chaos in the skies. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait. I stared at the radar, torn, unable to move."}
