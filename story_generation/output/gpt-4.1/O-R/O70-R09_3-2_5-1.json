The label read \u201cHigh Value\u2014Recipient Only,\u201d and my manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo shortcuts. Confirm ID, hand it over in person.\u201d I glanced at my watch. It was almost time for the kids\u2019 lesson. The holiday was just days away, and they still stumbled over the blessings. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d teach them properly this year, not just rush through it. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the lesson.

But here I was, stuck in traffic, clutching a package that couldn\u2019t be left on a doorstep. If I hurried, maybe I could make both work. But what if the recipient wasn\u2019t home?

I felt torn, pulled between my duty to my job and my responsibility to my family and faith, unsure which expectation I\u2019d have to let down."}
