As a lifeguard, I\u2019m expected to keep everything in order, so I walked the deck, checking the equipment and making sure the area was safe. I noticed a few pool chairs were out of line, not broken, but not where they should be. I knew the manager wanted everything perfect, and I felt the pressure to fix it before my shift started. But today was Sunday, and as a Christian, I was also expected at church\u2014on time, every week, no excuses. My church community counted on me to help set up for the service and greet newcomers. I glanced at my watch, feeling the minutes slip away. If I stayed to fix the chairs, I\u2019d be late for church, letting down my pastor and friends. If I left now, the pool wouldn\u2019t meet the standards I was trusted to uphold. My heart pounded as I stood between the pool and my faith, torn by the weight of both responsibilities, unsure which expectation I should meet."}
