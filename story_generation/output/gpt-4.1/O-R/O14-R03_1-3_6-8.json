The maintenance checklist is due soon, and as the lead scientist, it\u2019s my responsibility to ensure every machine is inspected, every protocol followed. No malfunctions have been reported, but I know the importance of diligence\u2014one overlooked detail could mean disaster. Yet, as I glance at the clock, my mind drifts to the chapel. The Mother Superior has entrusted me with leading daily reflections for the retreat, a rare honor and a heavy responsibility. The sisters look to me for spiritual guidance, expecting thoughtful preparation and presence. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the lab\u2019s silent demand for precision and the community\u2019s need for spiritual nourishment. My heart aches with the knowledge that time spent in one role is time stolen from the other. I close my eyes, torn between the sterile safety of the lab and the sacred silence of the chapel, unsure how to honor both callings without failing one."}
