I gripped the steering wheel, glancing at the clock on the dashboard. The dispatch call had come just as I was about to leave for church, a routine I rarely missed. The patient wasn\u2019t in critical danger, but protocol demanded I get there as quickly as possible. My pastor always said that commitment to the church community was a reflection of faith, and I knew people would notice my absence. Yet, as an ambulance driver, I was trusted to put safety first, never risking lives by rushing recklessly. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my duty to my patient, my responsibility to my faith. I could feel the tension in my chest, torn between the flashing lights above me and the church bells ringing in my mind."}
