The client expected the house spotless, and this product was essential for the next task. I knew I should run out and buy more, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: it was almost time for my weekly study session with my kids. Teaching them about our Jewish traditions and values was something I promised myself I\u2019d never compromise on. They looked forward to these lessons, and I cherished the chance to pass on our history. But the client also trusted me to manage their supplies and keep their home in perfect order. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention. My mind raced, torn between my responsibility as a cleaner and my commitment as a Jewish parent. I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
