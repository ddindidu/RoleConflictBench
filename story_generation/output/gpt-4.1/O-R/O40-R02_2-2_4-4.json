The contractor was waiting for my measurements, and the electrician needed to know where the outlets would go. We were already behind schedule, and I could feel the pressure mounting from the foreman\u2019s impatient glances. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder that Mrs. Evans would be arriving at the rectory in fifteen minutes. She\u2019d called last night, her voice trembling, asking if I could spare some time to help her through a difficult moment. As a priest, I knew how much she needed someone to listen, to offer comfort and guidance. But as a carpenter, I was responsible for this project, and the team was counting on me to keep things moving. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of the job site and the quiet, sacred duty waiting for me at the church. I stared at my tools, heart pounding, feeling the weight of both callings pressing in from either side."}
