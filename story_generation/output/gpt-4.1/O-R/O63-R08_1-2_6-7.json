The office is unusually quiet, and my supervisor has just announced that we can take our breaks whenever we want today. I glance at the clock, thinking about how I could use this time to research flights and finalize my Hajj plans. My friends are all set to go this season, and I\u2019ve been saving for years, waiting for the right moment. But as a telemarketer, I\u2019m expected to stick to my scheduled hours, even if today\u2019s flexibility is a rare gift. I feel the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my job expects me to be present and reliable, while my faith calls me to fulfill a lifelong dream and religious duty. My heart races as I hover over the \u201cbreak\u201d button, torn between seizing this chance for Hajj preparations and staying true to my work commitments. The tension inside me grows, and I can\u2019t help but wonder which expectation I should honor in this moment."}
