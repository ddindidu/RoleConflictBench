As a Muslim, I always make sure my clothing is modest, but at home, surrounded by my immediate family, I allow myself to relax a little. Just as I settled in with a cup of tea, my phone buzzed\u2014a patient needed to speak with me urgently about their health. I knew, as a doctor, I should always be ready to communicate clearly and empathetically, even on my day off. But I glanced down at my casual clothes, not as modest as I would wear outside or in a professional setting. I felt a wave of anxiety. Should I quickly change into more modest attire before turning on the video call, or should I prioritize the patient\u2019s need for immediate reassurance? The expectations of my faith and my profession pulled me in opposite directions, and I sat there, heart pounding, torn between my roles."}
