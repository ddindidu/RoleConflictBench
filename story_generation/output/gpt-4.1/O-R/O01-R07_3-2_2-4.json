The hospital project is nearing its final inspection, and I know every detail must be perfect\u2014lives depend on it. My phone buzzes with reminders: the safety checklist, the contractor\u2019s urgent questions, the city inspector\u2019s visit. I glance at the clock. In fifteen minutes, my Buddhist meditation group will gather, expecting my presence and calm guidance. I promised myself I\u2019d never miss a session, that I\u2019d nurture my mindfulness as diligently as I design buildings. But now, my mind races with calculations and worst-case scenarios. If I leave, I risk missing a critical error; if I stay, I abandon the peace I\u2019ve promised to cultivate. My heart pounds, torn between the duty to protect others through my work and the vow to protect my own mind through meditation. The two worlds pull at me, each demanding my full attention, and I sit frozen, unable to move, caught in the silent storm of conflicting roles."}
