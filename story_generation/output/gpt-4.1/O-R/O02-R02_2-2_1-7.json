My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cReligious education class, 30 minutes.\u201d The project manager\u2019s email from earlier echoed in my mind\u2014stakeholders needed a working prototype by tomorrow, or the funding might slip away. As an engineer, I was expected to deliver solutions, to be reliable and innovative under pressure. But as a priest, I was the shepherd of my parish, especially to the children who looked forward to our weekly class. Their parents trusted me to guide them, to be present and attentive. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait. My heart raced as I glanced at the clock, torn between the unfinished code and the lesson plan on my desk. I could already imagine the disappointment in my manager\u2019s voice, the confusion in the children\u2019s eyes if I let either side down. The pressure built inside me, a silent plea for more time, for a way to be wholly present in both callings."}
