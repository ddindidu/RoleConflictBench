As the housekeeping cleaner, I was expected to keep every corner spotless, but lately, I\u2019d only managed to tidy up the visible messes\u2014dusting the shelves in the common room, sweeping the entryway, wiping down the kitchen counters. The sisters trusted me to maintain a standard of cleanliness, but I knew I was falling short. My mind was elsewhere, pulled by my other calling.\n\nMother Superior had chosen me to lead the prayer vigil at the city cathedral tonight, a great honor for our convent. The sisters expected me to be spiritually prepared, to embody devotion and serenity as I guided the prayers of hundreds. But as the clock ticked closer to the event, I glanced at the untouched cleaning supplies and the list of chores still waiting for me. My heart pounded with anxiety\u2014how could I be both the diligent cleaner and the devoted nun everyone needed? The weight of their expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, torn between the mop and my prayer book, unsure which duty to fulfill first."}
