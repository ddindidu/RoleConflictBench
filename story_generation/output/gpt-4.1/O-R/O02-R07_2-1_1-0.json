My phone buzzed with another message from the project manager: \u201cWe need the prototype ready for tomorrow\u2019s demo. Stakeholders are anxious.\u201d My mind raced with calculations, deadlines, and the weight of everyone\u2019s expectations. If I didn\u2019t deliver, the project might stall, and I\u2019d let my team down.\n\nBut then, the gentle chime of the temple bell drifted through my window. It was time for the evening chant\u2014a ritual I\u2019d promised to attend, a moment of stillness and connection with my Buddhist community. I remembered the abbot\u2019s words: \u201cOur presence is a gift to each other.\u201d They counted on me, too, to help maintain the rhythm of our shared practice.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled between the urgent demands of my engineering role and the quiet, steady call of my spiritual life. My hands hovered over the keyboard, my mind wrestling with the impossible choice. The weight of both worlds pressed in, and I closed my eyes, caught in the tension of expectation, not yet ready to move."}
