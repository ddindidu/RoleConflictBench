The experiment was important, but not urgent; I could easily swap with a colleague or reschedule for another day. Still, the anticipation of new data tugged at my curiosity, the thrill of discovery urging me to stay. Yet, as the clock ticked closer to dusk, my thoughts drifted homeward. Every evening, I light a lamp and offer prayers at my small altar\u2014a ritual that grounds me, connects me to something beyond equations and test tubes. My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me of the sanctity of this daily practice, the expectation that I honor our traditions no matter how busy life becomes. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the scientist in me eager to push forward, the Hindu in me longing for the quiet comfort of ritual. My hands trembled slightly as I hovered over the lab bench, torn between the glow of the Bunsen burner and the gentle flame waiting for me at home."}
