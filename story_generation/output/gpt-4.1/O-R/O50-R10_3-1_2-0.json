The nurse\u2019s voice still rang in my ears: \u201cThe ventilator\u2019s failing\u2014please, hurry!\u201d As a machine repairer, I knew the expectation\u2014diagnose, troubleshoot, and fix the life-support device before it was too late. My mind raced through possible faults, but as I entered the room, the red lights and urgent beeping made my heart pound harder.\n\nYet, beneath my uniform, I felt the tug of another role. As a Hindu, I was supposed to perform my daily puja at dawn, but the emergency had pulled me away. I tried to steady my nerves by quietly repeating a short mantra under my breath, but guilt gnawed at me for not following the full ritual. The sacred thread on my wrist felt heavier than usual, a silent reminder of my spiritual duties.\n\nStanding between the failing machine and the patient\u2019s desperate family, I felt torn. The hospital needed my technical skills, but my soul yearned for the calm of ritual. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me as I reached for my tools, my mind caught between duty and devotion."}
