My manager always says, \u201cFriendly service keeps them coming back,\u201d so I make sure to chat, even as the line grows. I notice my coworkers glancing at the clock, reminding me that the office function is just a couple of hours away. I remember the email: \u201cDress business casual\u2014no uniforms, please.\u201d \n\nAs a Muslim, I always wear loose, long-sleeved tops and a hijab, even under my work vest. But the suggested dress code for the function is more relaxed, and I overheard some colleagues planning to wear short sleeves and fitted skirts. I feel the pressure to fit in, to be approachable and part of the team, especially since I\u2019m still new here. At the same time, I know my faith asks me to dress modestly, regardless of the occasion. \n\nI can already imagine the curious looks if I show up in my usual attire, and the awkward questions that might follow. My heart pounds as I ring up another customer, torn between wanting to belong and staying true to my beliefs."}
