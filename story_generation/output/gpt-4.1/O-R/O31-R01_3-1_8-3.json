The court summons lay open before me, a reminder of my duty to uphold the law with integrity and fairness. My testimony could sway the outcome of a case, and I knew how important it was to be present, to speak the truth without bias. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from the church secretary: Mrs. Evans, a gentle soul from my congregation, was struggling again. She\u2019d lost her husband last year, and I\u2019d promised to check in, to offer comfort as her pastor. The court date clashed with the time I usually visited her. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014one demanding justice, the other compassion. Could I let down the justice system, or could I let down a grieving woman who needed her pastor\u2019s support? My heart pounded as I stared at the calendar, torn between two worlds that both needed me, unsure which call to answer first."}
