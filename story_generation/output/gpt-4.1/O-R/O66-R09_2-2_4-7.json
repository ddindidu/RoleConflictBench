The dispatcher\u2019s voice crackled through the radio, reminding me of the busy night ahead. Cars darted in and out of lanes, their brake lights flashing unpredictably. I gripped the wheel tighter, reminding myself to drive defensively, to keep my passengers safe, to obey every traffic law. But my mind kept drifting to the synagogue. Tonight, I was supposed to chant a portion during the service\u2014a responsibility I\u2019d accepted weeks ago. My community expected me to be there, to honor my commitment, to uphold tradition. The clock on the dashboard glowed, each minute slipping away. If I rushed, maybe I could make it. But the rain, the traffic, the risk\u2014my duty as a driver was to be cautious, not hurried. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the demands: the safety of my passengers versus my promise to my faith. The synagogue\u2019s lights would be shining soon, waiting for me. But so were the red taillights ahead, and the lives in my backseat."}
