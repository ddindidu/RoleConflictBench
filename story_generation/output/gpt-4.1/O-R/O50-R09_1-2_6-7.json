It\u2019s a new client, her voice bright but anxious, asking if I can walk her through the basics of the machine I serviced last week. She\u2019s struggling, and I know my job isn\u2019t just to fix things, but to make sure people feel confident using them. I glance at the clock\u2014if I help her now, I\u2019ll be late for services, and tonight I\u2019m supposed to chant a portion. The rabbi and my community are counting on me; I\u2019ve practiced for weeks. My heart pounds as I weigh the responsibility I feel toward my client against the commitment I made to my faith and my community. I can hear the nervousness in her voice, and I remember how lost I felt the first time I used a new machine. But I also picture the congregation waiting, the Torah open, my name on the schedule. The phone feels heavy in my hand as I stand in the hallway, torn between two worlds, both needing me right now."}
