New drugs, new protocols\u2014my mind raced to keep up. I knew I had to stay sharp, for my patients\u2019 safety depended on it. But my phone buzzed, and I saw a string of urgent messages from church members. There\u2019d been a fire in the neighborhood\u2014families displaced, grief and fear spreading fast. As their pastor, they needed me to organize support, offer comfort, and be present in their pain. My heart ached for them, but my shift wasn\u2019t over, and I hadn\u2019t finished reading about the new medication guidelines. I felt pulled in two directions: the professional duty to stay informed and the spiritual calling to shepherd my flock. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stared at my phone, torn, unsure which role to answer first."}
