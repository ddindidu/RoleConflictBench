The address was across town, and the customer had left a note: \u201cPlease deliver by 6 PM\u2014urgent for dinner.\u201d My app flashed a reminder: \u201cOn-time delivery is essential.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting; my job depended on punctuality, and I prided myself on never being late.\n\nBut as I started the engine, I realized it was almost time for my evening puja. Every day, I set aside this sacred hour for prayers, chanting, and offerings. My family and I have always believed that skipping even one ritual brings imbalance, and I could already hear my mother\u2019s voice in my head, reminding me of the importance of devotion and discipline.\n\nMy hands tightened on the steering wheel. If I stopped for my prayers, I\u2019d risk being late and disappointing the customer, maybe even getting a complaint. But if I skipped my ritual, I\u2019d feel a deep sense of guilt and spiritual unease. The expectations from both sides pulled at me, and I sat there, heart pounding, torn between duty to my work and duty to my faith."}
