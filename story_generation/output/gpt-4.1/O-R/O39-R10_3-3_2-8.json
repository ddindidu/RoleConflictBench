The crane was holding a massive steel beam, swaying slightly in the morning breeze. My job was to help guide it into place, steady and precise, so the welders could secure it. Every second counted\u2014if I hesitated, the whole crew would be delayed, and the risk of an accident would rise. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder from my family. Today was the festival of Navratri, and I had promised to travel home, hours away, to join the rituals and offer prayers with my parents. They expected me to be there, to show my devotion and respect for our traditions. My heart pounded as I looked from the dangling beam to the road leading out of the site. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my duty to my team, and my duty to my faith and family. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent call of steel and the sacred call of the temple, unsure which demand I could bear to let down."}
