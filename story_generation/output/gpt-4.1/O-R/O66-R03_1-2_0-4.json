The passenger slid into the back seat, chatting cheerfully about her leisurely afternoon plans. She had more than enough time, she said, no rush at all. I smiled, nodding, but my mind was elsewhere. The convent had called just before I started my shift\u2014Sister Agnes had taken a turn for the worse, and the sisters were gathering for a special healing service. It was outside our usual schedule, but my presence was expected, my prayers needed. As I merged onto the main road, I felt the weight of my two worlds pressing in. The passenger trusted me to get her there safely and calmly, while my sisters hoped I would join them in prayer for Agnes. My hands tightened on the wheel, heart torn between the gentle duty of the road and the sacred call of the chapel, unsure which path I would choose."}
