My eyes flicked to the clock\u2014Jumu\u2019ah was less than an hour away. As an imam, I was expected to deliver the Friday sermon, a responsibility I cherished. But today, the masjid had arranged for a guest speaker, just in case. Still, the congregation would expect me, their regular imam, to be there, to guide them, to offer the words they needed.\n\nThe intercom crackled. \u201cExcuse me, operator, can you tell me which stop connects to the hospital?\u201d The passenger\u2019s voice was anxious, and I knew my duty as a subway operator was to provide clear, calm assistance. Safety and service came first here, underground.\n\nMy mind raced. If I left now, I could just make it to the mosque, but abandoning my post would mean letting down the passengers who relied on me. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the sermon, disappointing my community and perhaps myself. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting my best. My hands tightened on the controls as I tried to steady my breath, caught between two worlds, unable to move."}
