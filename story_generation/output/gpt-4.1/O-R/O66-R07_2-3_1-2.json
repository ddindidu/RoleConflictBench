My phone buzzed\u2014a passenger needed a ride to the train station, and their train was leaving soon. I glanced at the clock. If I took the job, I\u2019d have to drive fast, weaving through early morning traffic to get them there on time. As a taxi driver, I felt the weight of their urgency, the unspoken expectation to deliver them safely and swiftly. But today wasn\u2019t just any day. The monastery\u2019s annual festival began at dawn, and I had promised to help with the preparations. My teacher and fellow practitioners were counting on me to arrive early, to set up altars and welcome the community. The teachings of patience and presence echoed in my mind, clashing with the pressure to rush for my passenger\u2019s sake. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, heart pulled in two directions\u2014toward the needs of a stranger and the commitments of my spiritual family. The city lights blurred as I sat at the crossroads, torn between duty and devotion, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
