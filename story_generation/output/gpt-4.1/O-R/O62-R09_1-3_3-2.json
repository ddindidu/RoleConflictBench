As the lifeguard, I was expected to make sure everything was perfect before the swimmers arrived. I noticed a few pool chairs were out of line, not broken, but not quite right either. I knew the supervisor would want them straightened, and I felt the familiar pressure to keep the facility in top shape. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my son\u2019s bar mitzvah was just weeks away. He still struggled with his Torah portion, and I\u2019d promised to help him practice every morning. As a Jewish parent, it was my responsibility to guide him, to pass on our traditions and values, especially now. I stood by the pool, torn. Should I spend these precious minutes fixing chairs, or rush home to help my son prepare for one of the most important moments of his life? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my time, each too important to ignore."}
