My mind kept drifting to the clock\u2014my daily puja time was approaching. As a Hindu, I had promised myself never to skip my prayers, no matter what. The incense, the chanting, the offerings\u2014they were all waiting for me at home, and the thought of missing even a single ritual filled me with guilt. But as a cashier, I was expected to stay at my post, process every transaction accurately, and not leave until my shift ended. I glanced at the line; it was short, but steady. My heart pounded as I weighed my responsibilities. Should I ask my manager for a break, risking disapproval and possibly leaving my coworkers short-handed? Or should I stay, knowing I\u2019d be late for my prayers and break my spiritual discipline? The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, and I felt trapped, torn between duty to my job and devotion to my faith."}
