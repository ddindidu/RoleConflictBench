My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime when production picks up again. Find the problem before tomorrow.\u201d I knelt beside the machine, tools in hand, but my thoughts drifted to the temple. Tonight was the memorial service for a beloved elder, and the community expected my presence\u2014not just as a participant, but as someone who helps lead the chanting and supports grieving families. The incense, the soft glow of lanterns, the collective silence\u2014these were moments I cherished, reminders of impermanence and compassion. Yet here I was, torn between the hum of machinery and the call of the sangha. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cService at 7 PM.\u201d I glanced at the clock, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The machine\u2019s secrets resisted my efforts, and the temple\u2019s bell seemed to ring in my chest. I took a deep breath, caught between the demands of steel and spirit, uncertain which path to follow as the evening crept closer."}
