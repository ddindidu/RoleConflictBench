The clock on the wall ticks closer to the hour\u2014my hour, the one I reserve every week to lead the meditation group at the temple. My phone buzzes with a gentle reminder: \u201cGroup meditation, 10 minutes.\u201d I close my eyes for a moment, trying to center myself, but the checklist in my hand tugs me back.
