A patient had arrived with a raging infection, and I knew the only hope was to act fast\u2014prescribe the strongest antibiotics, monitor every vital sign, and stay by their side. As I prepared the orders, my phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was the church service, the one I\u2019d promised not to miss. My pastor had called earlier, gently reminding me of my commitment to the community, to worship, to fellowship. I could almost hear the hymns and see the familiar faces waiting for me. But here, in this sterile room, a life depended on my expertise and presence. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my duty as a healer, my devotion as a believer. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, each demanding all of me."}
