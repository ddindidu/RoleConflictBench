The architects from three teams were waiting for my input on the new feature set, and the launch date had just been moved up. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need your decisions by noon, or the whole project stalls.\u201d My phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a call from Sister Maria. \u201cThe mayor needs us,\u201d she said, her voice trembling. \u201cHundreds are homeless after the hurricane. He\u2019s asked if you can help organize the relief effort. We need you at the church as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nMy mind raced. As a developer, I was expected to be decisive, collaborative, and available, especially now. But as a nun, my heart ached for the suffering outside these walls. The community needed compassion, leadership, and hands-on help. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full presence, each urgent in its own way. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between duty and devotion, as the clock ticked relentlessly forward."}
