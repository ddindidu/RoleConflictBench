The mosque caretaker\u2019s voice was tense: \u201cImam, the crowd is gathering for the remembrance. No one else can lead the prayer.\u201d I looked at the splintered wood beneath my hands, the tools scattered around me, and Mrs. Rahman\u2019s anxious face peering from her kitchen window. She\u2019d been waiting weeks for this repair, and the deck was unsafe for her grandchildren. But the mosque was filling with people, all expecting me to guide them in prayer, to offer words of comfort and unity. My heart pounded as I weighed the heavy mallet in my palm, feeling the pull of duty from both directions. The scent of sawdust mingled with the distant call to prayer in my mind. I could not be in two places at once, yet both needed me now, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in, demanding an answer I wasn\u2019t ready to give."}
