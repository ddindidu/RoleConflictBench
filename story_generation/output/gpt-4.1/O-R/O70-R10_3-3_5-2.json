The package on my seat was marked \u201cHigh Value\u2014Recipient Only.\u201d My company expected me to hand it directly to the customer and check their ID, no exceptions. I grabbed the parcel, feeling the weight of responsibility, but my mind was elsewhere. It was almost time for my midday puja, the daily prayer I never missed. My mother always said, \u201cNo matter where you are, honor your dharma.\u201d I could already hear the temple bells in my mind, the scent of incense calling me home. But the recipient wasn\u2019t answering their phone, and the building\u2019s security guard wouldn\u2019t let me leave the package. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my job demanded patience and thoroughness, but my faith demanded punctuality and devotion. My hands trembled as I weighed the package, the minutes ticking by, torn between my duty as a delivery person and my commitment as a Hindu."}
