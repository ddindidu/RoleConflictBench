As a rabbi, I knew how much this day meant to the family, how they\u2019d counted on me to guide their son through this milestone. But right now, I was behind the wheel of my taxi, stuck in a snarl of traffic. A construction detour had squeezed the road to a single lane, and just ahead, a school zone sign flashed. Children clustered near the curb, their laughter and darting movements unpredictable. My foot hovered over the brake. The urge to speed up, to make it to the synagogue on time, pressed against my chest. But as a driver, I was responsible for every life near my bumper. The weight of my rabbinic promise battled with my duty to drive safely. I gripped the wheel, heart pounding, torn between the expectations of my congregation and the safety of the children outside."}
