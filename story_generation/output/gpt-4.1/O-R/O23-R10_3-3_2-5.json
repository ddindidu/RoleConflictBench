As a lawyer, I knew the stakes\u2014if I didn\u2019t review every clause tonight, my client could face devastating financial consequences. My phone buzzed with a message from a colleague: evidence of corruption within the company we were merging with. The wrongdoing was clear, and as a Hindu, my conscience screamed at me to act, to uphold dharma and protect those who might be harmed by this deceit.\n\nBut the clock was ticking. My client expected a thorough legal analysis by morning, and any delay could cost them dearly. Yet, if I ignored the corruption, I\u2019d be complicit in injustice, betraying my deepest values. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014professional duty on one side, spiritual and moral obligation on the other. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my profession and the unyielding call of my conscience. I stared at the contract, heart pounding, knowing I couldn\u2019t fulfill both expectations at once."}
