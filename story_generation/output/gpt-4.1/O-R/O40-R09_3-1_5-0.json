Tonight, I need to pore over the blueprints, double-check the measurements, and make sure I understand every detail before the crew arrives. But as I\u2019m laying out the plans on my kitchen table, my phone buzzes with a reminder: it\u2019s my turn to teach the children at our synagogue about the story of Ruth, a lesson I\u2019ve been preparing for all week. The study slot is flexible, but I know the kids look forward to our sessions, and their parents trust me to pass on our traditions. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my hands itching to work the wood, my heart pulled toward the circle of eager faces waiting for stories and songs. I stare at the blueprints, then at my lesson notes, feeling the tension knot in my chest as I try to figure out how to honor both the craft I love and the faith that shapes who I am."}
