The hearing was in two weeks, but I knew the expectation: review every detail, ensure no oversight, uphold the integrity of the court. My mind drifted to the convent, where word had just reached us of the family whose home was lost to fire. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to offer comfort, food, and clothing, to embody compassion in action. The sisters were already gathering supplies, their voices echoing down the hall, calling for help. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014my chambers demanded focus and diligence, the convent called for immediate, selfless service. I stared at the file, then at my habit hanging by the door, torn between the silent plea of justice and the urgent cry of mercy. My heart ached, knowing I could not give both roles what they deserved at the same time."}
