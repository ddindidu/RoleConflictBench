As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: keep my eyes on the road, anticipate the erratic moves of other drivers, especially in weather like this. A sudden lane change from a delivery van forced me to brake harder than I liked, my heart thumping. At the same time, my phone buzzed insistently in the cup holder. I glanced down at the screen\u2014an email from a young couple, asking if I could officiate their wedding next year. As a rabbi, I felt the weight of their hope, the expectation that I would respond quickly, offer guidance, and help them begin their journey together. But now, behind the wheel, every second of distraction could mean disaster. My mind spun with the tension: the duty to keep my passengers safe, the responsibility to my community, the fear of disappointing someone in either world. The rain blurred the city lights as I wrestled with what to do next."}
