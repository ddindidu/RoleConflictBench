My phone buzzed with a delivery notification: the customer was waiting outside, and I was just around the corner. As a delivery person, I knew I had to greet her with a smile, confirm her ID, and hand over the package with the utmost courtesy. But my mind was already at the mosque, picturing the congregation gathering, expecting me to lead the prayer since the usual backup was out of town. I could almost hear the quiet shuffle of feet on the carpet, the hopeful glances toward the front, the unspoken pressure to fulfill my duty as imam. My heart pounded as I pulled up to the customer\u2019s house, torn between the obligation to serve her professionally and the spiritual responsibility waiting for me at the mosque. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
