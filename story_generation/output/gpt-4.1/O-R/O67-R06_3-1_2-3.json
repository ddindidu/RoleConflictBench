I could already hear the choir warming up inside, the familiar hymns calling me to worship, to be present with my church family as I promised myself I would be this Sunday. But the dispatcher\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, urgent and insistent. As an ambulance driver, I\u2019m expected to respond without hesitation, to put lives first and reach the scene as fast as possible. Yet, as a Christian, I feel the pull to honor my commitment to God, to gather with others in faith, to find peace and renewal in worship. My heart pounded as I stood between the sanctuary and the siren, torn by the weight of both callings. I could see the pastor through the window, waving me in, and at the same time, I pictured the chaos on the highway, people needing help. I stood there, keys in hand, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
