The air was thick with the scent of marigolds and incense, and my mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me how important it was to be present for every ritual. My phone buzzed. It was a new client, calling during my journey. He sounded anxious, asking for basic tips on operating his new machine. I could hear the uncertainty in his voice, and I knew my job was to guide him, to make sure he felt supported. But the train was about to enter a tunnel, and soon I\u2019d lose signal. My family expected me to arrive on time, to help with the preparations, to show my devotion. My client expected clear, patient guidance. I felt the pressure building inside me, torn between the duty to my faith and the responsibility to my work. The festival was only once a year, but so was a client\u2019s first impression. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I would have to let down."}
