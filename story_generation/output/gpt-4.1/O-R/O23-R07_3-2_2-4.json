My client\u2019s future hinges on these clauses\u2014if I don\u2019t catch every nuance, they could face devastating financial loss. The pressure is immense; my phone buzzes with reminders, and my inbox fills with urgent messages from the senior partner. Yet, in fifteen minutes, my Buddhist meditation group will gather, as we do every week, to sit in silence and cultivate mindfulness. I promised myself I\u2019d be present, to let go of stress and reconnect with my breath. But my mind is anything but calm. The expectation to be a diligent, meticulous lawyer clashes with my commitment to inner peace. I feel my chest tighten, torn between the demands of my profession and the sanctuary of my spiritual practice. The weight of responsibility presses down on me, and I wonder if I can truly honor both paths."}
