I was already ahead of my quota, and the team chat buzzed with encouragement to keep pushing\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t let up now, every call counts!\u201d The pressure to keep outperforming was real, and I could almost hear my supervisor\u2019s voice reminding me that consistency was key to advancement. Yet, as the clock ticked toward evening, my phone vibrated with a gentle reminder from the temple: tonight was the memorial service, a time to honor those who had passed, surrounded by my Buddhist community. I was expected to be there, to chant, to offer incense, to be present in body and spirit. The thought of missing it filled me with guilt; these rituals were not just tradition, but a core part of my practice and identity.
