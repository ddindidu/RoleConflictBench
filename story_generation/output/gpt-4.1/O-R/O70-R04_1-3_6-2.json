The package on the seat beside me was marked \u201cUrgent,\u201d and the customer had already called twice, asking when I\u2019d arrive. I rehearsed my polite greeting, determined to be professional despite my growing anxiety. My phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from the mosque committee. The regular imam was ill, and a large crowd had gathered for a special remembrance. No one else was authorized to lead the prayer, and they were waiting for me. My heart pounded. I imagined the congregation\u2019s expectant faces, the weight of their trust in me as their imam. But the customer was waiting too, likely watching for me through their window, expecting courtesy and promptness. I felt torn, the demands of both roles pulling me in opposite directions. My hands gripped the steering wheel as I sat at the intersection, caught between the mosque and the customer\u2019s address, unsure which responsibility to answer first."}
