It was nearly ten, and the church bells would soon ring for Sunday worship. My supervisor expected every shelf to be stocked and every rag in its place before noon, and I knew she\u2019d check my work. I sighed, feeling the weight of the mop in my hand and the heavier weight in my chest. As a Christian, I longed to be in the pews, singing hymns and sharing prayers with my church family. I missed the warmth of fellowship, the peace that came from worship, and the sense of belonging. But the cleaning cart was only half-restocked, and the supply closet was a mess. If I left now, I\u2019d disappoint my boss and risk my job. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss another Sunday, another chance to reconnect with my faith. My hands trembled as I clutched the inventory sheet, torn between duty and devotion, wondering which expectation I could bear to let down."}
