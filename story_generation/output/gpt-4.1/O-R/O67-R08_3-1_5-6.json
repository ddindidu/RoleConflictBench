Dispatch had said it was a major heart attack\u2014every second mattered. As an ambulance driver, I was expected to stay calm, provide care, and get the patient to the hospital alive. But as I glanced at the prayer beads hanging from my rearview mirror, a familiar ache tugged at me. I was a Muslim, and my family and community expected me to perform Hajj, the sacred pilgrimage. Yet, with my modest salary and the unpredictable hours, I hadn\u2019t saved enough. Each time I saw a patient fighting for life, I was reminded of how fragile time was, and how my own spiritual duty remained unfulfilled. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanded my immediate action, the other my lifelong devotion. As I pulled up to the hospital, I felt torn, wondering if I was failing at both, unable to give my all to either."}
