The nurse\u2019s face was pale\u2014one of the life-support machines was flashing red, its screen filled with cryptic fault codes. As a machine repairer, I was expected to diagnose and fix the issue immediately; a patient\u2019s life depended on it. My hands moved quickly, but my mind was tangled. The hospital\u2019s policy required me to log every repair, but I noticed the previous technician had skipped a crucial safety check. Reporting it would mean he could lose his job, but ignoring it would compromise my integrity as a Christian, who is called to be honest and just. The weight of both roles pressed on me: the urgency to save a life, and the call to uphold truth and compassion. My heart pounded as I stared at the machine, torn between the demands of my profession and the values of my faith, knowing that whatever I chose would have consequences."}
