I put on my warmest smile, ushering them to their seats, offering tea, and promising everything would run on time. My hands moved automatically, sectioning hair and pinning curls, but my mind was elsewhere. Just before they arrived, I\u2019d received a desperate text from a member of my congregation\u2014someone in crisis, needing guidance about a decision that could change their life forever. As a pastor, I knew I should be there, listening, offering comfort and wisdom. But as a hairdresser, I was expected to be present, cheerful, and focused on making this bride\u2019s day perfect. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each impossible to ignore. I could feel my heart racing, torn between the anxious faces in my chair and the silent plea on my phone, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left waiting."}
