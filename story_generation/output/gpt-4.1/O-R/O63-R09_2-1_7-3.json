My stomach rumbles, reminding me I haven\u2019t eaten since early morning. I\u2019ve been eyeing the kosher snacks I brought from home, tucked away in my desk drawer. Management has been strict lately, watching our break logs like hawks because the phone queue never seems to shrink. If I take my break now, I\u2019ll be following the rules, but I know the supervisors are frowning on anyone stepping away when calls are backed up. Still, I need to eat, and I can\u2019t just grab anything from the vending machine; I have to stick to kosher food, which means my own snacks or the special pantry items. The pressure builds in my chest\u2014do I risk management\u2019s disapproval by taking my break as scheduled, or do I ignore my hunger and my religious needs to keep working? My headset beeps with another call, and I stare at the blinking light, torn between the demands of my job and my commitment to my faith."}
