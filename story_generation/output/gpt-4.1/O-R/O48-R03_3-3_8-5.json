As a nursing assistant, I knew my place was by his side, offering comfort and a listening ear. He had just received news that his cancer had returned, and the loneliness in his eyes haunted me. I wanted to sit with him, hold his hand, and let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. But my habit brushed against my arm, a reminder of my other calling. Today, I was expected to lead the prayer vigil at the cathedral\u2014a rare honor for our convent, and one I had been chosen for after much deliberation. The sisters were counting on me to represent our faith and community. I glanced at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away. My heart pulled in two directions: the suffering man who needed me now, and the sacred duty awaiting me at the altar. I pressed my palms together, torn between the silent plea in Mr. Harris\u2019s eyes and the weight of the expectations placed upon me by my sisters and my faith."}
