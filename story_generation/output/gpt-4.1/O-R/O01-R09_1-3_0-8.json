As an architect, I\u2019m trained to spot even the smallest inconsistencies\u2014today, I noticed a few in the new community center\u2019s plans. They\u2019re minor, unlikely to cause immediate problems, but my professional code nags at me: safety and compliance come first. I should stay, review every line, and make sure nothing slips through.\n\nMy phone buzzes. It\u2019s David from the synagogue. There\u2019s a funeral prayer in an hour, and they\u2019re short one person for the minyan. He asks if I can come. As a Jew, I know how important it is to help form the quorum, especially for a mourner\u2019s prayer. The community expects me to be there, to uphold tradition and support those in grief.\n\nI look at the clock, then back at the plans. If I leave now, I\u2019ll have to rush my review, risking a mistake. If I stay, the minyan will fall short, and someone will be denied the comfort of communal prayer. My chest tightens as I weigh the demands\u2014my duty to safety, my duty to faith\u2014each pulling me in a different direction."}
