The sun glinted off the water, and the usual chatter of swimmers filled the air. My eyes landed on a cluster of pool chairs\u2014slightly misaligned, not dangerous, but not up to standard either. I knew I should fix them, keep everything orderly, as expected of a lifeguard. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of the appointment I\u2019d promised to keep. A member of my congregation was waiting in the chapel, needing guidance, someone to listen and offer comfort. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me\u2014the whistle around my neck, the collar at my throat. Should I pause my rounds to offer spiritual counsel, or stay and ensure the pool met every safety and appearance standard? The demands pulled at me, each urgent in its own way, and I stood frozen, caught between the needs of the body and the needs of the soul."}
