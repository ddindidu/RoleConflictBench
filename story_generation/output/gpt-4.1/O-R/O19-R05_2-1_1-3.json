She depended on this precise combination of medications to keep her heart and diabetes in check. My mind was focused, counting pills, reviewing interactions, knowing that any mistake could have serious consequences. Just as I was about to finish, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the adult Torah class I was supposed to teach in half an hour. It was an optional session, but I knew several congregants looked forward to these discussions, and I felt a deep responsibility to guide them in their learning. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I left now, I could just make it to the synagogue in time, but Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s prescription wasn\u2019t ready, and the pharmacy was short-staffed. My heart pounded as I weighed the sacred duty of teaching Torah against the ethical obligation to ensure my patient\u2019s safety. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt torn, caught between two worlds that rarely collided so directly."}
