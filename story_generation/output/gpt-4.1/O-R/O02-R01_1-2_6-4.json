As the lead engineer, my team counted on me to provide accurate time estimates, even if the session was informal and the timeline still flexible. I knew my input would shape the next few months of work, and I didn\u2019t want to let anyone down by being unprepared or absent. Just as I was gathering my notes, my phone rang again\u2014this time, a call from a church member. Their voice trembled as they shared a crisis at home, seeking comfort and guidance. As their pastor, I was expected to be present, to listen, and to offer steady encouragement. My mind raced, torn between the technical demands of my engineering role and the emotional needs of my congregation. Both sides needed me, both expected my full attention, and I felt the weight of their trust pressing in from all directions. I stared at the clock, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that rarely collided but now demanded everything at once."}
