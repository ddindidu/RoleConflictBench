She pleaded for a quick repair and a quote, explaining it was his favorite and he wouldn\u2019t sleep without it. I examined the damage, already calculating the time and materials needed, when my phone buzzed urgently. It was the mosque committee\u2014an unexpected crowd had gathered for a special remembrance, and I was the only imam available to lead the prayer. My hands, still dusty with sawdust, trembled as I looked at the hopeful faces before me. The mother\u2019s eyes were full of expectation, and the boy\u2019s trust was palpable. Yet, I could almost hear the hum of voices waiting at the mosque, relying on me for spiritual guidance. Both roles demanded my presence, both were urgent in their own way. My heart pounded as I stood between the call of my craft and the call to prayer, torn by the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides."}
