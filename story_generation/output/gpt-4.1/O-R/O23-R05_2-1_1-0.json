The deadline for filing is looming, and my client is counting on me to catch every nuance, every possible risk. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cBegin sermon prep for Shabbat.\u201d I glance at the calendar\u2014several weeks until I stand before my congregation, but I know how much thought and care a meaningful sermon requires. They expect inspiration, guidance, a message that will resonate. My mind tugs in two directions. The legal documents demand my sharpest focus, but the congregation expects my heart and wisdom. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each urgent in its own way. My client\u2019s trust, my community\u2019s faith\u2014both are on the line.
