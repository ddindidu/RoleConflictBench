As a nursing assistant, I knew I had to check his vitals every few minutes, record them, and alert the nurse if anything changed. My hands shook as I scribbled the numbers, but my mind was elsewhere. Down the hall, Mrs. Lee waited in the chapel, her eyes red from crying. She\u2019d called me, her pastor, desperate for guidance about a decision that could change her life forever. She needed me to listen, to pray with her, to help her find peace. But Mr. Harris needed me too\u2014his life could depend on my vigilance. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders, the stethoscope and the collar. I could hear Mrs. Lee\u2019s quiet sobs echoing in my mind as I watched Mr. Harris\u2019s chest rise and fall. I stood in the hallway, torn, the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions, my heart pounding with the impossible choice before me."}
