Tonight, I need to pore over blueprints and technical drawings, making sure every measurement and joint is perfect. My mind is already racing with details: dovetail joints, wood grain, the order of assembly. But as the sun sets, hunger gnaws at me. I\u2019m far from home, in a small town, and the only kosher-certified vendor is a tiny stand across the street. Their hours are short, and if I don\u2019t eat now, I\u2019ll have nothing until morning. Yet, if I stop to eat, I\u2019ll lose precious time for reviewing the plans, risking mistakes tomorrow. If I skip the meal, I\u2019ll be distracted and weak, unable to focus on the intricate work ahead. The expectations press in from both sides\u2014my commitment to my craft, and my devotion to my faith. I stand at the window, blueprint in hand, stomach rumbling, heart heavy, torn between the demands of my hands and the rules that guide my soul."}
