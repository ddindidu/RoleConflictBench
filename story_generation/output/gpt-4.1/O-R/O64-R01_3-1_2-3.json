It was the end of my shift, and the drawer was full of large bills\u2014one mistake now, and the numbers wouldn\u2019t add up. My manager expected precision, especially with high-value transactions. As I handed a customer their change, I noticed Mrs. Carter at the end of the line, her shoulders slumped, eyes red. She\u2019d lost her husband last month, and as her pastor, I knew she needed more than a polite smile. I wanted to step away, offer her comfort, maybe a prayer, but the register demanded my full attention. The pressure to be accurate warred with the urge to be present for her. My heart pounded as I weighed the risk of a costly error against the call to support someone in pain. The line moved forward, and I stood frozen, torn between the numbers in my till and the ache in Mrs. Carter\u2019s eyes, unsure which duty I should answer first."}
