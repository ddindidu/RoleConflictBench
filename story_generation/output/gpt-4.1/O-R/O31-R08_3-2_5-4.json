A violent assault was unfolding in the square, and people screamed, scattering in panic. As a police officer, I was trained to act fast, to protect citizens and property, to put myself between danger and the innocent. My uniform felt heavy, but not as heavy as the expectations I carried. \n\nLater, as the chaos settled, I remembered the office function scheduled for the afternoon. My colleagues\u2014men and women\u2014would all be there. As a Muslim, I was expected to dress modestly, to uphold my faith\u2019s guidelines even in social settings. But my police uniform, standard issue, didn\u2019t always align with those expectations. I felt the familiar tension rising inside me: the duty to my badge, the duty to my faith. \n\nWould I change into my uniform for the function, risking discomfort and questions? Or would I find a way to adapt, knowing eyes would be on me either way? The weight of both roles pressed down, and I stood at the crossroads, torn between the demands of my profession and the convictions of my heart."}
