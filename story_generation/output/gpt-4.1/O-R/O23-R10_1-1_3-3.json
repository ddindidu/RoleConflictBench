It was a routine matter, one that could easily be postponed if I needed to. As I reviewed my notes, I noticed a colleague quietly slipping ahead in the line to file documents, bypassing others who had been waiting. It was a small act, but it pricked at my conscience. As a Hindu, I was raised to value dharma\u2014righteousness and ethical conduct\u2014even in the smallest moments. I felt a tug to speak up, to gently remind my colleague of fairness. But as a lawyer, I was expected to focus on my client\u2019s interests, to be present and ready for the hearing, not to get sidetracked by minor office politics. The courthouse clock ticked, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something different. My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do next."}
