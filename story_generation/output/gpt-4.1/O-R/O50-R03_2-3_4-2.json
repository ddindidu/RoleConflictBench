They\u2019d missed their last service window, and now the temperature gauges were edging into the danger zone. If I didn\u2019t act soon, the whole line could shut down, costing the factory precious hours and risking my reputation as a reliable repairer. My hands itched to grab my tools, to get to work cleaning and tuning, but my phone buzzed again\u2014another message from Sister Maria. The hurricane had left so many without homes, and the mayor was pleading for help. As a nun, I was expected to lead the relief effort, to comfort the frightened and organize food and shelter. My heart ached for the families huddled in the church hall, but the machines demanded my attention too. I felt torn, the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me, each role pulling me in a different direction. I closed my eyes, caught between the whirring of engines and the cries for help, unsure which duty to answer first."}
