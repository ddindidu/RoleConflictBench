The machines hummed louder than usual, their casings warm to the touch. I knew they\u2019d missed their last service window, and if I didn\u2019t clean and maintain them now, a breakdown was almost certain. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime. Stay on top of it.\u201d\n\nBut as I reached for my tools, my phone vibrated with a gentle reminder: it was time for my midday prayers. As a Hindu, I never skipped my rituals\u2014each chant, each offering, each moment of stillness was a promise I\u2019d made to myself and my faith. My family expected me to uphold our traditions, and I felt the weight of their pride and my own devotion.\n\nI stood frozen, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the sacred rhythm of my spiritual life. The machines needed me now, but so did my faith. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
