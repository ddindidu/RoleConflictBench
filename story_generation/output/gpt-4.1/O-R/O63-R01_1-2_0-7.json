The phone rang, and I launched into my practiced greeting, ready to handle the usual objections. Most callers were polite, sometimes curious, and the questions they asked were ones I\u2019d answered a hundred times before. My responses flowed easily, almost automatic. But as I listened to a caller\u2019s hesitation, my mind drifted to the sermon I was preparing for Sunday. As a pastor, I was expected to guide my congregation, to help them wrestle with moral choices and find comfort in faith. The words I\u2019d written for the sermon echoed in my mind\u2014messages about honesty, compassion, and listening deeply to others. Yet here I was, following a script, steering conversations toward a sale, sometimes glossing over concerns just to meet my quota. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. Was I truly listening, or just performing? The expectations of my two worlds pressed in on me, and I wondered how I could reconcile the demands of my job with the calling of my heart."}
