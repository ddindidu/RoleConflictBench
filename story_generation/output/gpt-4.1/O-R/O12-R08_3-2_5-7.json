The architects from three different teams were waiting for my input on the new feature design, and the launch date had just been moved up. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need your decisions by tomorrow, or the whole project stalls.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting, knowing how much everyone was counting on me to keep things moving.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a different kind of message\u2014my friends sharing their excitement about Hajj. This was the year I had saved for, the year I could finally fulfill this pillar of my faith. They were booking flights, making plans, and I could almost feel the spiritual pull, the longing to join them on this journey I\u2019d dreamed of for so long.\n\nI felt torn, caught between the urgent demands of my team and the deep, personal call of my faith. My mind raced with questions: Could I let my colleagues down? Could I let myself miss Hajj again? The weight of both worlds pressed in, and I sat there, unable to move, wrestling with what to do next."}
