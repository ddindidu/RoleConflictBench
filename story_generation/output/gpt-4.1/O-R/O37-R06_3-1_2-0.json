My supervisor had been clear: every room needed to be spotless, especially the ones checked out this morning. As I entered 304, I noticed a wallet on the nightstand, half-hidden under a magazine. My job was to clean, not to meddle, but I couldn\u2019t ignore it. I picked it up, intending to hand it in, but curiosity got the better of me. It was thick with cash\u2014more than I\u2019d seen in months. \n\nA voice inside reminded me of my Christian values: honesty, integrity, doing what\u2019s right even when no one is watching. But another part of me, tired and struggling to pay bills, whispered that no one would know if a few bills went missing. The pressure to meet my cleaning quota pressed on me, but so did the weight of my faith. I stood there, wallet in hand, torn between the expectations of my job and the teachings I tried to live by, my heart pounding as I wrestled with what to do next."}
