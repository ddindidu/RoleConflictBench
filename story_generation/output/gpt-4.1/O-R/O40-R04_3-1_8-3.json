Termites had eaten through the beams in her living room, and she feared the ceiling might collapse. \u201cPlease, can you come today? It\u2019s urgent,\u201d she pleaded. As a carpenter, I knew the damage couldn\u2019t wait\u2014someone\u2019s safety was at risk, and I felt the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders.\n\nBut today was Friday, and as the imam, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah at the mosque. The congregation looked to me for guidance and inspiration, especially during these uncertain times. I had spent hours preparing my sermon, but I also knew that the guest speaker was ready and willing to step in if needed.\n\nMy mind raced between the two worlds: the desperate need for repair, the trust of my community, the sense of duty in both roles. I could almost hear the echo of the adhan mingling with the sound of hammering nails. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, torn between the call to serve with my hands and the call to lead with my words."}
