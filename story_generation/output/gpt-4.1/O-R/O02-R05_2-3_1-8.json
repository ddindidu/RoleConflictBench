The prototype demo was scheduled for tomorrow, and the team was counting on me to finalize the design tonight. Without a working prototype, the stakeholders might pull the plug, and months of work would be lost. My mind raced with technical details\u2014circuit diagrams, code snippets, last-minute tweaks. Then my phone buzzed again. It was Miriam from the synagogue. Her voice trembled as she told me that her father had passed away. The family needed me to officiate the funeral service as soon as possible, to guide them through their grief and honor their loved one. I could hear the pain in her voice, the expectation that I would be there for them, as their rabbi. My heart ached, torn between the urgent needs of my team and the sacred responsibility to my community. I sat at my desk, paralyzed, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure how I could possibly meet the demands of both."}
