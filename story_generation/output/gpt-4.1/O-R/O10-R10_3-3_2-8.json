My phone buzzed again\u2014another email from the external auditor, marked urgent. They needed the quarterly financial statements by noon, and I knew the files weren\u2019t quite ready.

Today was the most important day of the festival, and my parents had traveled even farther than I had, expecting me to join them in every ritual, every offering. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my profession and the devotion to my faith.
