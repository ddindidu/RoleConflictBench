The experiment I\u2019d planned for weeks hinged on this window; the data could push my research forward in ways I\u2019d only imagined. But as I checked the date, my heart sank\u2014it was Friday evening, just before Shabbat. My family expected me at synagogue, and though attendance was always strong, I knew my absence would be noticed. I could almost hear my father\u2019s gentle reminder about the importance of community and tradition, the way he\u2019d always said, \u201cWe don\u2019t just show up for ourselves, but for each other.\u201d Yet, the scientist in me felt the weight of opportunity slipping away if I didn\u2019t seize this chance. I felt torn, the pull of my heritage and the drive of my curiosity wrestling inside me, each demanding loyalty, each refusing to let go."}
