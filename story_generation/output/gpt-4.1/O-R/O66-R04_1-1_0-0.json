The afternoon prayer was less than an hour away, and as the imam, I was expected to lead it. Yet, today, Brother Yusuf was at the mosque\u2014fully capable, and the congregation would be small. Still, I knew some worshippers valued my presence, expecting me to guide them, even if just out of habit.\n\nAs I navigated the city streets, I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. My passenger trusted me to get him there safely and on time, but he didn\u2019t need urgency. The mosque, meanwhile, could manage without me, but I worried about disappointing those who looked for me at the front. My hands tightened on the wheel, heart tugged in two directions, wondering which responsibility should come first."}
