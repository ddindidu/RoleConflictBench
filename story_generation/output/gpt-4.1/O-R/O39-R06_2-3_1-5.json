The foreman\u2019s voice echoed across the site, reminding me that the carpenter was waiting for the next load. I knew if I didn\u2019t keep up, the whole crew would fall behind, and I\u2019d be letting everyone down. My muscles ached, but I pushed on, determined to do my part. Yet, as I glanced at my phone, I saw the reminder for tonight\u2019s church service. Pastor had asked me to help set up chairs and greet newcomers\u2014something I\u2019d promised to do every week. My church family counted on me, and I felt a deep responsibility to honor my commitment to God and the community. The clock ticked closer to the service time, but the pile of lumber was far from gone. My heart pounded with anxiety, torn between the demands of my job and my faith. I stood there, caught in the middle, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, unsure which path to take."}
