The new office design had to be perfect\u2014open, efficient, every inch serving a purpose. My phone buzzed with a reminder: sermon notes due for Sunday. I glanced at my Bible, open to the passage I\u2019d chosen about honesty and integrity. My mind tugged in two directions. The client wanted a sleek, modern space, but their request to cut corners on accessibility gnawed at me. As an architect, I was expected to deliver what they wanted, but as a pastor, I was called to teach and model compassion and fairness. My congregation looked to me for guidance on living out their faith, yet here I was, wrestling with a decision that would affect real people\u2019s daily lives. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each with its own set of values. I stared at the plans, then at my sermon notes, heart pounding, unsure which voice to follow."}
