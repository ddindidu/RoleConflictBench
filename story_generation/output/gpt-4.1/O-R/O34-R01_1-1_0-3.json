The radar screen is almost empty, just a few blips gliding through the sky. I lean back, savoring the calm, but my phone buzzes with a message from Mrs. Carter\u2014her son is struggling again, she says, and could use a word of encouragement. As a pastor, I know how much those small gestures matter, especially in the lonely hours before sunrise. But as an air traffic controller, I\u2019m tethered to my headset, responsible for every soul in the sky, even when the airspace is clear. Regulations are strict; distractions are forbidden. My heart aches for the Carters, but my mind is trained to scan the radar, to anticipate the unexpected. I stare at my phone, thumb hovering, torn between the silent needs of my congregation and the silent skies I must guard."}
