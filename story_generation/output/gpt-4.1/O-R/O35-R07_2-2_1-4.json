The radio crackles: \u201cSignal delay ahead, adjust speed.\u201d My hands tighten on the throttle. I know the passengers expect a smooth, punctual ride, and I pride myself on delivering it. But today, my mind drifts to the meditation hall, where my sangha gathers for our weekly hour of silence. I promised myself I\u2019d be present, to sit with them, to breathe and let go of the day\u2019s noise. The schedule is tight\u2014if I slow too much, I\u2019ll be late; if I rush, the train will jolt, and I\u2019ll fail my duty. My heart pounds with the weight of both worlds: the responsibility to hundreds of strangers behind me, and the quiet promise I made to myself and my practice. The tunnel lights blur as I wrestle with the choice\u2014duty or devotion, movement or stillness."}
