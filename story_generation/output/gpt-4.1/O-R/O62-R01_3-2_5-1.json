A quick check confirmed my suspicion\u2014the filtration system was malfunctioning. If I didn\u2019t act fast, the water could become unsafe, putting every swimmer at risk. I started drafting a maintenance request, my mind already racing through the steps to shut down the pool and alert the staff. Just then, Mrs. Carter, a longtime member of my congregation, appeared at the gate. Her eyes were red, and she clutched her Bible tightly. \u201cPastor, do you have a moment?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling. She needed guidance, and I could see the weight of her burden. I felt the pull of both worlds\u2014one demanding immediate action to protect lives, the other calling for compassion and presence in a moment of spiritual crisis. My heart pounded as I stood between the pool and Mrs. Carter, torn by the urgency of both needs, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my full self to both at once."}
