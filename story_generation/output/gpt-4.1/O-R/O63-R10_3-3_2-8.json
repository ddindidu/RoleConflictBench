The faint scent of incense from my suitcase mixed with the sterile air. I was hundreds of miles from home, here for the festival that my family had waited for all year. My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cYou must be present for every ritual, beta. The blessings are strongest when we are together.\u201d But my manager\u2019s email was clear\u2014no missed calls, no excuses, even on the road.\n\nThe line connected. A customer\u2019s angry voice burst through, demanding to know why our offer was legitimate, why he should trust me. I tried to steady my voice, recalling the training: stay calm, answer every objection, don\u2019t let them hang up. But my phone buzzed with messages from my cousin: \u201cThe puja is starting. Where are you?\u201d My heart pounded. I could almost hear the temple bells in the distance, the chanting, the swirl of marigold petals. I was expected to be fully present, to offer prayers with my family, but here I was, tethered to my script, my customer\u2019s frustration growing. I felt torn, pulled by two worlds that refused to let go."}
