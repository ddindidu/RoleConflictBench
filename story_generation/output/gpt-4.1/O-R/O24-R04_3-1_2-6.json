As a judge, I was expected to review every detail, to ensure justice was served swiftly and fairly. The case file was thick, and the clock was ticking\u2014my ruling was needed within the hour. Just as I began to read, my phone buzzed. It was Ahmed, a member of my congregation. He had mentioned earlier that he needed to talk, seeking spiritual guidance, and I had told him to call whenever he needed. Now, his voice trembled with urgency, and I could hear the strain in his words. As an imam, I was supposed to be present, to listen, to offer comfort and wisdom. But the legal documents in front of me demanded my full attention. My mind raced, torn between the duty to uphold the law and the responsibility to support my community. Both roles expected my undivided focus, but I only had one self to give. I stared at the phone, then at the case file, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me, unsure which call to answer first."}
