The numbers blurred as I double-checked every entry, knowing that even a small mistake could cause trouble for the entire office. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the message: \u201cPastor, do you have a moment? I really need to talk.\u201d It was Sarah, a member of my congregation, someone who rarely reached out unless it was serious. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. The company expected precision and timeliness\u2014my signature on those documents was a promise of accuracy. But Sarah needed guidance, a listening ear, and perhaps a prayer. I could hear the clock ticking, each second a reminder of the deadline, while my heart tugged me toward the door, toward Sarah\u2019s pain. I closed my eyes, torn between the demands of my profession and my calling, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me as I tried to decide which responsibility to answer first."}
