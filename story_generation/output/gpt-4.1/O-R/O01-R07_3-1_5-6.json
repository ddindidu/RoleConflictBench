Every line I drew felt heavy with responsibility\u2014lives would depend on the clarity of these emergency routes, the efficiency of these operating rooms. My phone buzzed. It was Tenzin, my friend from the sangha. \u201cCan we talk about the sermon from yesterday?\u201d he asked, his voice gentle. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to understand impermanence.\u201d I glanced at the clock. The project deadline loomed, and my supervisor expected a flawless design. Yet, Tenzin\u2019s request tugged at me. As a Buddhist, I should be present, open to reflection, and support my friend\u2019s spiritual journey. But as an architect, I was expected to focus, to ensure every detail was perfect. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my profession and the quiet call of my spiritual path. I closed my eyes, feeling the tension coil in my chest, uncertain which role to honor in this moment."}
