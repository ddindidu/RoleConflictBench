My screens show only a handful of blips\u2014no holding patterns, no urgent calls. It\u2019s the rare lull, the kind that makes my heart slow and my mind wander. Today is the weekly group meditation, the hour I look forward to all week, a time to sit with my sangha and let the world\u2019s noise fall away. I glance at the clock; the session starts soon. \n\nBut as I reach for my phone to let my supervisor know I\u2019d like to step out, a new flight pings onto my radar, requesting an early approach. The expectation is clear: I am responsible for this airspace, even when it\u2019s quiet. My Buddhist practice calls me to be present, to nurture my mind and spirit, but my duty as an air traffic controller demands vigilance, readiness for the unexpected. My chest tightens as I weigh the needs of the pilots above against the promise I made to myself and my community. The silence in the room grows heavy, and I sit, torn between the sky and the cushion, not yet ready to choose."}
