Mrs. Goldstein sat across from me, her pill bottles lined up like sentinels. She was starting a new heart medication, and I needed to walk her through every possible interaction\u2014her chart was a maze of risks. My phone buzzed in my pocket: a reminder that the children\u2019s Torah class at the synagogue would begin in fifteen minutes. As their rabbi, I was expected to be there, to guide them through the week\u2019s parsha, to answer their eager questions about Jewish law. I could picture their faces, waiting for me, their parents trusting I\u2019d be there. But Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s anxious eyes pulled me back. She depended on me to keep her safe, to explain what her doctors hadn\u2019t. My mind raced, torn between my duty to my patient\u2019s health and my responsibility to my students\u2019 spiritual growth. The minutes ticked by, each one tightening the knot in my chest. I felt the weight of both callings pressing in, demanding I choose, knowing that whatever I decided, someone would be left waiting."}
