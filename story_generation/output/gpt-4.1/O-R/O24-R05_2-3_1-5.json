As a judge, I know the weight of my responsibility\u2014every detail must be scrutinized, every argument considered. The parties expect fairness, diligence, and a mind undistracted by anything else. Yet my phone buzzes with a reminder: the conversion candidate\u2019s last study session is tonight. As their rabbi, I am their guide, their reassurance before the Beit Din. They have waited months for this, and my presence is not just expected\u2014it is needed. My mind races, torn between the law books and the Torah scrolls, between the silent demands of justice and the hopeful eyes of a student. I feel the pressure mounting, the fear of failing in either role. I want to be present, attentive, and wise in both places, but time and energy are finite. My heart aches as I stare at the clock, knowing I must choose where to give my best self, and dreading the disappointment that will follow, no matter what I decide."}
