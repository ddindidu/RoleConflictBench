The experiment I\u2019d designed had taken months to prepare, and the data could be pivotal for my research. Yet, as I packed my notes, Sister Agnes found me in the hallway, her eyes gentle but insistent. \u201cMother Superior would like you to lead the reflections during the retreat,\u201d she said. \u201cYour insight inspires the sisters.\u201d The retreat overlapped exactly with my lab reservation. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to scientific discovery, the thrill of uncovering truth through data, and my commitment to spiritual guidance, the trust my sisters placed in me. I imagined the disappointment in my advisor\u2019s eyes if I missed the experiment, the lost opportunity. But I also pictured the expectant faces of the sisters, seeking wisdom and comfort. My heart pounded as I realized I could not be in both places. The silence of the convent seemed to echo my turmoil, and I stood frozen, torn between the microscope and the chapel, unable to choose."}
