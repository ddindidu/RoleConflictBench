The termites had done their work well\u2014this house needed urgent repairs, and the family was anxious, their voices tight with worry. As a carpenter, I knew my responsibility: to draw up a plan, gather materials, and start work immediately. They depended on me to keep their home safe.\n\nBut as I measured the damage, my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder: the weekly Buddhist study circle met tonight. We were to discuss a chapter on detachment and presence, one I hadn\u2019t yet read. My teacher expected thoughtful participation, and I longed for the peace those evenings brought. Yet, the family\u2019s need pressed on me, their hope resting on my skills and my promise to help.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds\u2014one demanding my hands, the other my mind and heart. My chest tightened as I tried to imagine how I could be in two places at once, how I could honor both the urgent call to repair and the quiet call to reflect."}
