My manager\u2019s eyes flicked to the clock, silently urging me to keep the line moving, to avoid mistakes, to be the efficient cashier everyone expected. But my mind was elsewhere\u2014at the mosque, where the congregation was gathering for Friday prayers. Today was special: a milestone for our community, and I was meant to deliver the sermon. People had come from distant towns, eager to hear words of guidance and celebration. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of the time, and my heart pounded with guilt. I could not abandon my post; the store was short-staffed, and my absence would leave chaos. Yet, the thought of letting down my community, of empty anticipation in the mosque, gnawed at me. Each beep of the register felt heavier, the weight of two worlds pressing on my shoulders, both expecting me, both needing me, and I stood frozen between them, unable to move."}
