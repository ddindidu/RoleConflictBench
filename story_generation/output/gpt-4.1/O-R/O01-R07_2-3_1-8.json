The contractor\u2019s email blinked on my screen, urging me to approve the next phase. But as I traced the lines, I saw it: a miscalculation in the stairwell design, a risk that could endanger lives if left unaddressed. My phone buzzed with a gentle reminder\u2014my teacher\u2019s message about tomorrow\u2019s temple session. I was to summarize the Heart Sutra, distilling its wisdom for the sangha. The expectation was clear: to offer clarity and presence, to be a vessel for the Dharma. Yet, my mind was split. The project demanded immediate attention, my responsibility as an architect pressing on my conscience. But the teachings called for stillness, for deep reflection, not hurried notes scribbled between safety reports. I felt the tension coil in my chest, the weight of two worlds pulling me in opposite directions. How could I honor both the safety of others and the integrity of my spiritual path? The clock ticked on, and I sat, caught between duty and devotion, unable to move."}
