As a judge, I knew I had to review it before tomorrow\u2019s session. The law demanded my diligence, and I prided myself on being thorough and fair. But as I reached for the case file, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my son\u2019s bar mitzvah was just days away, and he still struggled with his Torah portion. He needed me to sit with him, to guide him through the ancient words, to pass on the traditions that shaped our family. My community and my heart expected me to be present, to teach, to nurture his Jewish identity. Yet the bench demanded my focus, my impartiality, my time. I stared at the legal brief, then at the worn pages of the Torah on the table, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each calling me to fulfill a promise I wasn\u2019t sure I could keep."}
