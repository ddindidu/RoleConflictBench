My headset crackled with pilots\u2019 voices, anxious for updates as holding patterns stretched longer. I scanned the approach fixes, calculating how to shave seconds off delays, knowing every minute mattered to families eager to reunite. My supervisor\u2019s voice reminded me: keep the airspace safe, keep it moving. But my phone vibrated on the desk\u2014a reminder of my other calling. In less than an hour, I was supposed to meet with Mrs. Alvarez at the rectory. She\u2019d confided in me last Sunday, her voice trembling, about a struggle she could no longer bear alone. She needed guidance, comfort, a listening ear. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the responsibility to hundreds of lives in the sky, and the sacred trust of a soul in pain. My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, torn between the demands of the radar and the quiet sanctuary waiting across town."}
