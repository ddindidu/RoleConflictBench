My patient, Mrs. Lee, sat across from me, her eyes searching mine for reassurance as she asked about her recent blood work. I knew she valued honesty, and as her doctor, I owed her clear, compassionate answers. Yet, as I began to explain, my phone buzzed\u2014a gentle reminder that the daily prayer service would begin in ten minutes. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead, to be present, to offer spiritual guidance and comfort. I could see the trust in Mrs. Lee\u2019s face, her need for my full attention, but I also imagined the congregation gathering, waiting for me to open the service. My heart pounded with the pressure of both worlds, each demanding my presence, my care, my voice. I felt torn, standing at the intersection of science and faith, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
