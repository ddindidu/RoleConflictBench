She smiled at me in the mirror, insisting she\u2019d just shampooed at home. The salon\u2019s policy was clear: every client\u2019s hair must be washed and conditioned before a cut. My manager expected consistency, and clients expected the pampering. But Mrs. Lee\u2019s hair was clean, and she looked tired, as if she\u2019d already had a long day.\n\nAs I considered what to do, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Sister Agnes: a parishioner needed to see me, urgently. She was struggling with her faith and needed guidance. As a nun, I was expected to be available for spiritual support, to listen and offer comfort, especially in moments of crisis. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one demanding I follow rules and routines, the other calling me to be present for someone in need.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. Should I follow the salon\u2019s expectations, or leave to fulfill my spiritual duty? The clock ticked, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
