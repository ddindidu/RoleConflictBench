My shift had ended late, but I promised myself I\u2019d make it to the gym. As a police officer, staying fit isn\u2019t just about looking good\u2014it\u2019s about being able to protect people when it matters. The gym was my routine, my way of making sure I could do my job. But as I grabbed my bag, my phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was my turn to chant the Torah portion at synagogue. I\u2019d committed weeks ago, and I knew how important it was to my community and my faith to be present, to uphold tradition. My rabbi and my family expected me there, and I felt the weight of that responsibility. I stood in the hallway, gym bag in one hand, prayer book in the other, feeling the pull from both sides. I wanted to be the officer my city needed, but also the Jew my community counted on. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which promise I would have to break tonight."}
