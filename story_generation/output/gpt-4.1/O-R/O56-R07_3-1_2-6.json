I smiled, welcoming them, trying to project calm and reassurance as I led them to their seats. My hands moved automatically, sectioning hair, offering tea, making small talk to ease their nerves. Just as I was about to start on the bride\u2019s intricate updo, my phone buzzed. It was my friend from the temple, asking if I had a moment to talk about the sermon we\u2019d heard last night\u2014something about impermanence and letting go. I knew she was struggling and needed someone to listen, to reflect with her. But here, in the salon, I was expected to be present, attentive, and cheerful, the anchor for this anxious bridal party. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to my clients, and the call to spiritual companionship. I stood there, scissors in hand, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, unsure which voice to answer first."}
