As a lifeguard, I\u2019m expected to enforce every safety rule, no exceptions. Suddenly, I spot a child flailing in the deep end\u2014a restricted area. My heart pounds; I know I must act, but just as I rise from my chair, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from Brother Ahmed, a long-time congregant. He\u2019s pleading for a private meeting, saying he can\u2019t wait any longer\u2014his family is falling apart, and he needs my guidance as his imam. I feel the weight of both uniforms pressing on me: the red of the lifeguard, the white of the imam. The pool demands my vigilance, the community my compassion. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, yet both roles expect me to be present, decisive, and unwavering. My mind races, torn between the urgent need in the water and the desperate call for spiritual support. I grip the whistle tighter, caught in the impossible space between duty and devotion, knowing that whatever I choose, something vital will be left unattended."}
