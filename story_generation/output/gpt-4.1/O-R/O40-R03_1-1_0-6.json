As a carpenter, I\u2019m expected to be on site early, tools ready, and\u2014most importantly\u2014alert enough to follow every safety protocol. One slip, one moment of distraction, and someone could get hurt. But today, as a nun, I had promised myself a quiet afternoon of spiritual reading and reflection, a rare chance to nourish my soul in silence. The abbess reminded me last night how important it is to keep my spiritual commitments, to not let worldly duties crowd out my time with God. Yet, as I sipped my tea, my phone buzzed: the foreman needed me early, a delivery had arrived, and the crew couldn\u2019t start without me. My heart twisted. If I rushed to the site, I\u2019d be tired, distracted, and risk missing the peace I so desperately craved. But if I stayed, I\u2019d let down my team and compromise safety. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait."}
