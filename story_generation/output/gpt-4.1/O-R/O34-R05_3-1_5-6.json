Suddenly, a pilot\u2019s voice crackled through: \u201cTower, this is Delta 342, low fuel, requesting immediate vectors.\u201d My heart thudded. Every second counted. I relayed instructions, voice steady, mind racing. In the brief lull, my phone buzzed\u2014a text from a young couple, eager and hopeful: \u201cRabbi, are you available to officiate our wedding next June?\u201d I knew how much this meant to them, how long they\u2019d waited for this day. But right now, a plane was circling, desperate for guidance, lives depending on my focus. My rabbinic heart wanted to respond with warmth and certainty, to offer reassurance and joy. My controller\u2019s mind screamed for undivided attention, for precision and calm. The weight of both roles pressed in, expectations colliding.
