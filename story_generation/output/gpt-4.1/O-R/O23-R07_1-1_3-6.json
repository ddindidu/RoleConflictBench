My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for a procedural hearing scheduled in an hour. It was a minor matter, one that could easily be postponed without consequence. Still, as a lawyer, I felt the familiar tug of duty: clients expected me to be present, to represent them with unwavering commitment, no matter how trivial the case.\n\nJust then, my friend from the temple called. He sounded troubled, asking if I could meet to discuss a sermon that had left him unsettled. As a Buddhist, I knew the importance of spiritual companionship, of being present for others in their moments of need. The teachings urged me to listen, to reflect, to offer compassion.\n\nI stared at my calendar, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. The courthouse and the temple\u2014each calling me, each expecting my presence. My heart raced as I tried to reconcile the demands, torn between professional obligation and spiritual responsibility, knowing that whatever I chose, something essential would be left waiting."}
