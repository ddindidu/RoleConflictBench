The morning calls are routine\u2014most customers are polite, and the script answers their questions easily. My manager praises my calm tone and quick responses. But as noon approaches, my mind drifts to the office function scheduled for this afternoon. The invitation said \u201cbusiness casual,\u201d and I know from past events that most women wear short sleeves and fitted skirts. I can already hear the comments\u2014\u201cAren\u2019t you hot in that?\u201d or \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try something lighter?\u201d I want to fit in with my colleagues, to be seen as approachable and part of the team, especially since networking is encouraged. But I also feel the weight of my faith, the comfort and conviction in dressing modestly, covering my arms and hair as I always do. My manager expects everyone to mingle and look \u201cprofessional,\u201d and I wonder if my appearance will set me apart, make me seem distant or unwilling. The phone rings again, but my thoughts are tangled, caught between the expectations of my job and the quiet strength of my beliefs."}
