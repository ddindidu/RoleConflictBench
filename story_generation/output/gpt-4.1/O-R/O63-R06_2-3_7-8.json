As a telemarketer, I was expected to take my scheduled break at exactly 2:15, no exceptions. Management watched our break logs like hawks, and I\u2019d already been warned once about stretching my time away from the phones. But at 2:13, just as I was about to log out, a call came through. The woman on the other end sounded frail, her voice trembling as she explained she\u2019d just lost her husband and didn\u2019t know how to handle the bills piling up. My heart ached for her. As a Christian, I knew I should show her compassion, listen, and offer comfort, even if it meant staying on the line past my break. But the pressure from management weighed on me\u2014if I didn\u2019t log out on time, I risked another warning, maybe worse. My finger hovered over the \u201cend call\u201d button, torn between the demands of my job and the call to show love in a moment when it mattered most."}
