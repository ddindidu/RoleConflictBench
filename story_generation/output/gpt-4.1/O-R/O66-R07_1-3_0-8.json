He\u2019d mentioned he was in no rush, just heading to meet a friend for coffee. The city traffic was light, and the ride should be easy. But my mind kept drifting to the temple, to the message from my teacher that still lingered on my phone: \u201cPlease prepare a summary of the Heart Sutra for tomorrow\u2019s session.\u201d I\u2019d promised to devote my evening to study and reflection, to honor the teachings and share them clearly with others. Yet here I was, behind the wheel, my shift not ending for another two hours. I felt the tug of responsibility\u2014to deliver my passenger safely and on time, to be present and attentive as a driver. But the weight of my spiritual commitment pressed on me, the expectation to be prepared, to serve my sangha with clarity and care. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I wrestled with the demands of the road and the call of the Dharma, uncertain which path to follow first."}
