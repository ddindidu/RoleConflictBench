New drugs, new protocols\u2014my mind raced to keep up. I knew I had to stay sharp, for my patients\u2019 safety depended on it. My phone buzzed. A message from Mrs. Carter, a member of my congregation: \u201cCan we talk? I\u2019m struggling.\u201d I glanced at the clock. My break was almost over, and I still hadn\u2019t finished reading about the new anticoagulant. But Mrs. Carter\u2019s words tugged at me. As her pastor, I was expected to offer comfort, to listen, to be present. Yet as a pharmacist, I was expected to be knowledgeable, up-to-date, and focused. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding my full attention. My heart ached for Mrs. Carter, but my mind screamed about the responsibility I owed my patients. I stared at my phone, torn, the newsletter open in one hand and her message glowing in the other, caught between two callings that refused to let go."}
