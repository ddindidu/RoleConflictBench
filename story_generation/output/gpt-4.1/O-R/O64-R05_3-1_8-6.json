I force a smile as the next customer, red-faced and impatient, slams her basket on the counter. \u201cYou people are so slow!\u201d she snaps. I remind myself to stay calm, to be the friendly cashier everyone expects, even as my heart pounds. My phone buzzes in my pocket\u2014a message from a young couple I met at synagogue. They want to know if I can officiate their wedding next year, and they\u2019re hoping for a quick answer. I know how important this is to them; as a rabbi, I\u2019m supposed to be present, responsive, a source of guidance and certainty. But right now, I\u2019m trapped behind the register, tethered to the demands of this job, unable to give them the thoughtful reply they deserve. The customer glares, waiting for me to finish her transaction, while the couple waits for a sign that I care about their future. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, and I don\u2019t know how to be both people at once."}
