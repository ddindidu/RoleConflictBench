As the judge, I knew the defendant\u2019s release order needed to be drafted and signed immediately\u2014any delay would keep him in custody longer than necessary. But today, I had planned to spend the day at home with my family, relaxing in the comfort of loose, casual clothes that fit the modesty I value as a Muslim. I had already changed out of my formal attire, feeling the relief of soft fabric and the privacy of my home.\n\nNow, the urgent call from my clerk pulled me back to my duty. I stared at my reflection, torn. The expectation as a judge was clear: professionalism, even in written orders, and the implicit standard of appearance if I had to return to the courthouse or be seen on a video call. But as a Muslim, I cherished the comfort and modesty of my home clothes, especially around my family. My mind raced, heart pounding, as I weighed the pressure to uphold the dignity of my judicial role against the peace I found in my faith and home."}
