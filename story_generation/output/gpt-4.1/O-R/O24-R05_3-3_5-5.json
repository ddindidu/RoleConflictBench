The defendant\u2019s anxious family waited outside, desperate for news. As judge, I was expected to draft a clear, thorough order\u2014no room for error, not with someone\u2019s freedom at stake. My pen hovered over the paper, but my phone buzzed insistently. It was the conversion candidate\u2019s sponsor, reminding me that the final study session was about to begin. As rabbi, I was responsible for guiding this soul through the last, crucial steps before their Beit Din. The candidate had prepared for months, and this session could not be postponed without jeopardizing their journey. My mind raced: the law demanded precision and immediacy, but my community expected compassion and presence. I felt the weight of both robes\u2014judicial and rabbinic\u2014pressing down, each pulling me in a different direction. My heart pounded as I stared at the order, then at the Torah texts on my shelf, torn between the demands of justice and the call of faith."}
