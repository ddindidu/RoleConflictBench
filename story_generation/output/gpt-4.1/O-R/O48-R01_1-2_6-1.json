As a nursing assistant, I knew how much he needed someone to sit with him, to listen, to offer a gentle word or a hand to hold. He looked up at me with tired eyes, and I could feel the weight of his loneliness. I pulled up a chair, ready to give him the time he deserved.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was waiting in the chapel, desperate for guidance about a decision that could change her life. As her pastor, I knew she needed me to listen, to pray with her, to help her find clarity and peace.\n\nI felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. Mr. Harris needed my presence, my compassion. Sarah needed my wisdom, my faith. Both were looking to me for comfort, but I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. The expectations pressed in on me, and I sat there, wrestling with which part of myself I would have to set aside, even if just for a moment."}
