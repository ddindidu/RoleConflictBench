As a lifeguard, I knew that even a second\u2019s distraction could mean disaster, especially with the tide as high as it was today. Every whistle, every shout, every splash demanded my full attention. But my mind kept drifting to the letter from my doctor, the one that said my health was declining faster than I wanted to admit. This year might be my last chance to perform Hajj, the pilgrimage I\u2019d dreamed of since childhood, a pillar of my faith as a Muslim. My family urged me to go, and my heart ached with longing for Mecca. Yet, the thought of leaving this beach, even for a week, filled me with dread. Who would watch over these swimmers? What if something happened in my absence? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding everything I had, and I stood at the edge of the water, torn between duty and devotion, unable to move."}
