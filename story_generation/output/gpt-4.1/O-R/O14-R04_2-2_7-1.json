The safety audit was in two hours, and I\u2019d already found a cracked seal on the centrifuge. If I didn\u2019t fix it, the lab could be cited, or worse, shut down. My phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee: \u201cBackup is sick. Can you lead dhuhr prayer today?\u201d I stared at the text, my heart pounding. The congregation would be waiting, expecting me to guide them, especially since I\u2019d always told them how important it was to keep the prayer times. But if I left now, the lab wouldn\u2019t be ready, and my team would be at risk. I could almost hear the disappointment in both my colleagues\u2019 and congregants\u2019 voices. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing on my chest, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
