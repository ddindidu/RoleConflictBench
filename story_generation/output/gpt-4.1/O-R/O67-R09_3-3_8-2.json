My hands gripped the wheel, knuckles white, as I navigated the ambulance through the storm. The patient in the back was fading fast, and every second counted. I knew I had to drive safely\u2014one wrong move on these slick roads, and we\u2019d all be in danger. But my mind kept drifting to my son, sitting at home with his Torah portion open, struggling. His bar mitzvah was only days away, and he still stumbled over the Hebrew words. I was supposed to be there, guiding him, teaching him the traditions and values that meant so much to our family. The guilt gnawed at me\u2014my duty to my patient clashed with my responsibility as a father and a Jew.

I pressed harder on the gas, torn between the life in my care and the life waiting for me at home, unsure which path to follow."}
