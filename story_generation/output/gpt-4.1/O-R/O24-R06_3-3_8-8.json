I was in the middle of delivering instructions, carefully referencing the precedent that had guided so many cases before. Suddenly, my clerk slipped me a note\u2014an urgent alert. The Supreme Court had just overturned the very precedent I was relying on. My mind raced. As a judge, I was expected to stay current, to uphold the law as it stood, not as it had been. I had to stop, reconsider, and possibly redirect the entire trial.\n\nBut as I looked at the faces in the courtroom, I saw confusion and anxiety. The defendant, a young man, looked terrified. As a Christian, I was called to show love and compassion, to offer reassurance and kindness, especially in moments of fear. Yet, my duty as a judge demanded impartiality and strict adherence to the law, even if it meant causing distress. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the tension\u2014how could I be both the unwavering judge and the compassionate Christian in this moment?"}
