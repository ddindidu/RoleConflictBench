The bold red \u201cNo Diving\u201d signs were right in front of them, but they seemed invisible to the kids. As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce the rules, keep everyone safe, and intervene before someone got hurt. My heart pounded with the familiar urgency\u2014should I blow the whistle, call them out, and risk embarrassing them in front of their friends?\n\nBut just moments before, at the same community gathering, I had shared a story from scripture about compassion and understanding, reminding everyone to approach others with patience and kindness. As a pastor, I was expected to guide with empathy, to teach by example, and to foster trust. Now, I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I acted too harshly, would I undermine the message I\u2019d just shared? If I hesitated, would I fail in my duty to protect? The tension twisted inside me as I watched the teenagers, caught between the whistle in my hand and the words I\u2019d spoken only minutes ago."}
