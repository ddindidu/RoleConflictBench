The architects from three different teams were waiting for my input on the new feature design, and the product manager had just announced the launch date was moved up\u2014again. My mind raced through the technical dependencies, the diagrams I still needed to finish, and the decisions only I could make. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was the sole imam for this Friday\u2019s sermon. The community had already shared the topic, and people were expecting me to deliver a thoughtful khutbah. I pictured the congregation, some of whom had messaged me earlier in the week, eager for guidance and inspiration. The weight of both worlds pressed on me\u2014my team\u2019s progress stalled without my input, and my community\u2019s spiritual needs resting on my shoulders. I felt my chest tighten as I tried to imagine how I could possibly be present for both, knowing that each role demanded my full attention at the same time."}
