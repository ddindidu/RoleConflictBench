I glanced at the clock\u2014just twenty minutes until Friday prayers. I was already dressed in my abaya and hijab, ready to leave for the mosque. The client\u2019s voice crackled through the headset, sharp and suspicious. \u201cHow do I know this offer isn\u2019t a scam? I want details, now.\u201d My training as a telemarketer told me to stay calm, answer every question, and never let a customer feel ignored. But my mind kept drifting to the mosque, the peace I felt in prayer, and the expectation to be present, both physically and spiritually, in the main hall with my community. My supervisor hovered nearby, expecting me to resolve the call. The minutes ticked by, my heart pounding as I tried to juggle the customer\u2019s demands with my own need to honor my faith. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down, each demanding my full attention, and I didn\u2019t know which to choose."}
