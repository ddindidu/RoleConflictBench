Mrs. Feldman\u2019s voice trembled as she described her deck\u2014splintered and unsafe, a hazard for her grandchildren. She needed it fixed today, before her family arrived for the weekend. I promised I\u2019d come by, already picturing the tools and lumber I\u2019d need. As I gathered my things, another message flashed across my screen: a reminder from the synagogue. The Cohen family\u2019s bar mitzvah, months in the making, was set for this afternoon. I was to lead the service, guide their son through his Torah portion, and bless the family in front of the entire congregation. My heart pounded. Both families were counting on me, each in their own way. I could see Mrs. Feldman\u2019s anxious face, hear the anticipation in the Cohen boy\u2019s voice. The weight of their expectations pressed on me, pulling me in two directions. I stared at my tool belt, then at my rabbinic robe, feeling the impossible tension between the work of my hands and the calling of my spirit."}
