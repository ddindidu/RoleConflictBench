Tomorrow, I was to begin the largest carpentry project of my career\u2014a custom library for the town\u2019s new community center. The plans were intricate, demanding my full attention tonight to ensure every measurement and joint would be perfect. Yet, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the bar mitzvah ceremony I was to officiate was scheduled for tomorrow morning. Months of preparation, a family\u2019s hopes, a young boy\u2019s rite of passage\u2014all resting on my presence and guidance as their rabbi. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my craft and the sacred duty to my congregation. Both roles demanded my best, but the hours overlapped, and I felt the weight of letting someone down no matter what I chose. My hands trembled, hovering over the blueprints, as I tried to quiet the storm of guilt and obligation swirling inside me."}
