My headset crackled with voices\u2014\u201cDelta 142, turn left heading 090, descend and maintain 5,000\u201d\u2014and I coordinated with the next sector, my mind racing to keep the airspace safe. The storm was pushing flights into my sector faster than we could hand them off, and every second counted. \n\nThen my phone buzzed. It was a text from Sarah, a member of my congregation. \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now.\u201d I knew she\u2019d been struggling, and as her pastor, I was expected to offer comfort, to be present, to listen. But the demands of the radar, the lives in the sky, pressed in on me.
