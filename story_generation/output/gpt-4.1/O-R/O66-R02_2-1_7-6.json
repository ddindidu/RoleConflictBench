They looked exhausted, and I could see the relief in their faces when I stepped out to help them load their bags. As a taxi driver, I knew I needed to be courteous, efficient, and professional\u2014helping with luggage, making sure the fare was fair, and getting them to their destination safely. They mentioned wanting to split the fare, and I mentally prepared to handle the transaction smoothly.\n\nBut as I glanced at the dashboard clock, my heart tightened. In less than an hour, I was supposed to be at the church, leading the first planning meeting for the adult faith formation series. As a priest, I was expected to be present, organized, and inspiring\u2014especially at the start of a new season. The parish counted on me to guide them, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never let them down.\n\nSitting behind the wheel, I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me. The travelers needed me now, but so did my parish. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the two worlds, unsure which duty I should honor first."}
