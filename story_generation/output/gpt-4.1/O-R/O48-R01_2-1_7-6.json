She\u2019d just come out of surgery, and her eyes darted around the room, searching for comfort. As a nursing assistant, I knew my job was to offer her reassurance, to be a calm presence. \u201cYou\u2019re safe here,\u201d I whispered, trying to steady her breathing. But as she squeezed my hand, she asked, \u201cDo you think God is punishing me?\u201d My heart clenched. I wanted to share the story of Job, to offer her hope through faith, as I would in my role as a pastor. But I remembered the hospital\u2019s policy\u2014no religious discussions unless the patient requested it directly. \n\nLater, at the community center, I led a small group, and someone brought up suffering. Instinctively, I began to share the story of Job, weaving in lessons of endurance and faith. But I caught myself, remembering that not everyone in the group shared my beliefs. I felt torn, caught between my duty to provide comfort as a nursing assistant and my calling to teach as a pastor. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I sat in silence, wrestling with what to say next."}
