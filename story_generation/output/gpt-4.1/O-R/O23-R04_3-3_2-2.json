My client\u2019s future hinged on my careful review\u2014one overlooked clause could mean disaster. The clock ticked mercilessly, reminding me of the urgency. Just then, my phone buzzed. The mosque committee member\u2019s voice was anxious: the congregation had gathered for the special remembrance, and I was the only authorized imam present. They were waiting for me to lead the prayer. My mind raced. As a lawyer, I owed my client diligence and precision, especially now. As an imam, I was responsible for guiding my community in worship, especially on such a significant occasion. Both roles called to me with equal urgency, their expectations heavy on my shoulders. I felt torn, my heart pounding as I weighed the immediate needs of my client against the spiritual needs of my community. The pressure mounted, and I sat frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which duty to answer first."}
