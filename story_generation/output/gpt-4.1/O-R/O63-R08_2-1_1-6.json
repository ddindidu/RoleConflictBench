The script is supposed to guide me, but lately, more and more prospects ask technical questions I can\u2019t answer. My supervisor expects me to handle objections smoothly, to keep the conversation going, but I feel exposed when I stumble over details I don\u2019t know. I want to do well, to keep this job, because I need the income.\n\nBut as a Muslim, I also carry the weight of another expectation: to perform Hajj. My parents remind me gently, and I feel it in my prayers\u2014the longing to fulfill this pillar of my faith. Yet, I\u2019m early in my career, barely making enough to cover rent and groceries, let alone save for the pilgrimage. Each time I hear the call to prayer, I feel the tension tighten inside me. I want to be a good employee, to meet my supervisor\u2019s demands, but I also want to be a good Muslim, to answer the call of Hajj. The two roles pull at me, and I sit at my desk, torn, unsure which expectation I can meet first."}
