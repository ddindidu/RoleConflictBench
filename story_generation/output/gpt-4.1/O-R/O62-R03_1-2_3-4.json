As I walked the pool deck, I noticed a few chairs out of place\u2014nothing dangerous, but not up to the standard I was expected to maintain. My supervisor had been clear: every detail mattered, even the small ones. I bent to straighten one, but my watch beeped. The special healing service for Sister Agnes was about to begin, and as a nun, I was expected to be present, to pray and support my community, especially in times of need. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to keep the pool immaculate, a sign of my commitment and responsibility, and the call to prayer, a sacred obligation to my faith and my sisters. I stood frozen, the echo of splashing water and distant church bells mingling in my ears, torn between the pool deck and the chapel, feeling the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders."}
