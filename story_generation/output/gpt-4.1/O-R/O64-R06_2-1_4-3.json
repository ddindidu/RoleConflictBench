As a cashier, I knew the rules: no returns without a receipt, no exceptions. The policy was clear, and my manager had reminded us just last week\u2014stick to the guidelines, or risk a write-up. Then an elderly woman approached, her hands trembling as she explained she\u2019d lost her receipt but needed to return a sweater she\u2019d bought for her grandson. She looked at me with pleading eyes, and I felt a pang of sympathy. \n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder about Sunday worship at church. I hadn\u2019t been in weeks, always working or too tired, but I missed the sense of peace and community. My faith taught me to show compassion, to help those in need, and to be present with my church family. But here I was, torn between following store policy and showing kindness, between my job and my faith. My heart ached as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, unsure which path to take."}
