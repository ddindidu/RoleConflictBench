My teacher asked me to summarize the Four Noble Truths for tomorrow\u2019s temple session, and I promised myself I\u2019d prepare something meaningful.

I force a smile into my voice, but my thoughts are tangled between the script I must recite and the teachings I long to contemplate. I feel the pressure of my headset and the weight of my promise to my teacher. I want to honor my spiritual path, but the fear of disciplinary action gnaws at me.
