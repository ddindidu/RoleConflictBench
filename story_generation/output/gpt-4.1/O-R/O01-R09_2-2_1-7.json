The contractor\u2019s email blinked on my screen: urgent, they needed my approval to proceed. But as I traced the lines of the new atrium, my stomach tightened. The support beams weren\u2019t up to code\u2014if I didn\u2019t flag this now, someone could get hurt. My phone buzzed. A reminder: tonight was my turn to chant Torah at synagogue, a commitment I\u2019d made weeks ago. My community expected me there, and I felt the weight of that promise. I glanced at the clock. If I stayed to finish the safety review, I\u2019d miss the service. If I left now, the project would stall, and worse, I\u2019d be letting my professional standards slip. My mind raced, torn between the duty to protect lives and the responsibility to honor my faith and community. The two roles pulled at me, each demanding my full presence, and I sat frozen, heart pounding, unable to move."}
