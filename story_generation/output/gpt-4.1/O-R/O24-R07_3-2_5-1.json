The defendant\u2019s anxious face flashes before me as I review my notes, knowing I must draft a clear, thorough order for his release. The law demands precision\u2014every condition must be explicit, every word weighed. Yet, my phone vibrates with a gentle reminder: the memorial service at the temple begins soon. As a Buddhist, I am expected to be present, to join the community in chanting and remembrance, to offer compassion and support. My robes are folded in my bag, ready for the evening, but my judge\u2019s gown still weighs on my shoulders. The clock ticks. I feel the pull of duty from both worlds\u2014one demanding clarity and justice, the other presence and compassion. My mind races, torn between the urgency of the defendant\u2019s freedom and the collective solace of my sangha. I close my eyes, searching for stillness, but the conflict only grows sharper within me."}
