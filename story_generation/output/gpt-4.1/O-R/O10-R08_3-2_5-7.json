My heart skipped. The notice pointed out a discrepancy in a client\u2019s tax return\u2014one that needed my immediate attention. As an accountant, I knew the gravity of such notices; compliance was not just a professional duty, but a legal one. I glanced at the envelope containing my Hajj savings, the one I\u2019d guarded for years. My friends were finalizing their travel plans, sending me messages about group bookings and shared prayers. The expectation to fulfill this pillar of my faith pressed on me, a dream I\u2019d nurtured since childhood. Yet, the urgency of the tax issue demanded my presence, my expertise, and possibly my savings if penalties arose. My mind raced, torn between the call of my profession and the call of my faith, each demanding my full commitment, each unwilling to wait. I sat at my desk, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which path I would have to choose."}
