As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce the safety rules strictly\u2014no one was allowed in the deep end without supervision. But just as the clock struck the hour for my daily puja, a sacred time I set aside to light a lamp and offer prayers at my home altar, I spotted a child floundering in the deep end, where swimming was strictly forbidden. My heart pounded. The rules demanded I act immediately, but my faith called me home, to honor the ritual that anchored my day. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing on me. The pool echoed with shouts, and the image of the flickering lamp at my altar flashed in my mind. I stood at the edge, caught between the urgent call of duty and the quiet pull of devotion, unsure which expectation I could bear to break."}
