She looked anxious, clutching the paper tightly. My duty as a pharmacist was clear: I needed to explain the medication, its side effects, and answer her questions with patience and care. But my mind kept drifting. Earlier that morning, my doctor had told me that my health was declining, and if I wanted to perform Hajj, this year might be my last chance. As a Muslim, the pilgrimage was a sacred obligation, one I had dreamed of fulfilling my whole life. Yet, the pharmacy was short-staffed, and my patients depended on me for guidance and reassurance. I could see the worry in Mrs. Rahman\u2019s eyes, and I knew she needed my full attention. But the weight of my own spiritual duty pressed heavily on my heart. I felt torn, caught between the expectations of my profession and the call of my faith, unsure which path to follow."}
