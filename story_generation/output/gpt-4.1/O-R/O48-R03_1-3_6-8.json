He looked up, his eyes brightening just a little. \u201cStay a while, will you?\u201d he asked, his voice tinged with loneliness. I knew how much these moments meant to him\u2014how much he needed someone to listen, to simply be there. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to offer not just care, but companionship, especially to those who felt forgotten.\n\nBut as I sat beside him, my mind drifted to the note tucked in my pocket from Mother Superior. She\u2019d asked me to lead the daily reflections for our upcoming retreat\u2014a great honor, but one that required hours of spiritual study and preparation. The community was counting on me to guide them, to be present in prayer and reflection.\n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. Mr. Harris needed me now, in this small, quiet room. My sisters needed me soon, in the chapel\u2019s hush. I could feel the expectations pulling me in opposite directions, my heart torn between the call to serve and the call to lead. I sat there, wrestling with the choice, unsure which path to follow."}
