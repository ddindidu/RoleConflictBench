My client\u2019s future hinged on my scrutiny\u2014one overlooked clause could mean disaster. I felt the weight of my responsibility as a lawyer, the expectation to be thorough, precise, and timely. Yet, the chapel bell tolled, echoing down the quiet halls of the convent. Morning prayer was about to begin, and as a nun, I was expected to be present, to join my sisters in devotion and uphold the rhythm of our communal life. My heart pounded with the pressure of both worlds. The contract\u2019s deadline loomed, but so did the sacred call to prayer. I stared at the document, then at my habit folded neatly on the chair, torn between the demands of justice and faith, between the world\u2019s urgent needs and the quiet discipline of spiritual life."}
