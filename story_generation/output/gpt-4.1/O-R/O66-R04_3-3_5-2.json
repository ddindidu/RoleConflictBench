Children clustered near the curb, their laughter rising above the hum of engines. The construction detour had squeezed traffic into a single lane, and the line of cars behind me grew impatient. I kept my foot light on the brake, eyes darting between the rearview mirror and the children. My phone buzzed on the passenger seat\u2014a message from the mosque committee. The special remembrance was about to begin, and the congregation was waiting. No one else could lead the prayer; it had to be me. My heart pounded. As an imam, I was expected to be present, to guide and comfort, especially on such an important day. But as a taxi driver, I was responsible for every life on this street, for obeying the law and keeping these children safe. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I felt myself caught between duty and devotion, unable to move forward without letting someone down."}
