My mind was half on the beeping scanner, half on the sermon I needed to finish for Sunday. As I handed a receipt to Mrs. Carter, I noticed Mr. Evans, a member of my congregation, hesitating near the end of the conveyor belt. He looked troubled, his eyes darting between me and the floor. When the last customer left, he stepped forward, voice low. \u201cPastor, do you have a moment? I really need your advice. It\u2019s about my marriage.\u201d My heart clenched. I could see the pain in his face, the kind that needed more than a quick word. But behind him, another customer was already unloading groceries, glancing at her watch. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me\u2014the expectation to keep the line moving, to be efficient and accurate, and the deeper call to listen, to guide, to be present for someone in need. My hands hovered over the register, torn between the demands of the job and the needs of the soul before me."}
