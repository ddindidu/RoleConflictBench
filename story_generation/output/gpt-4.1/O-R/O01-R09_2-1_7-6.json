The contractor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, \u201cWe need you on-site tomorrow morning, early. If we don\u2019t pour the foundation before the rain, we\u2019ll lose a week.\u201d I knew the team was counting on me to keep the project moving, to answer last-minute questions and sign off on changes. But as the sun dipped lower, I felt the familiar tug\u2014Shabbat was approaching. My family expected me at the synagogue, and so did my community.
