The script in front of me felt like a thin shield, barely covering the gaps in my knowledge. My supervisor expected me to handle every objection smoothly, to keep the conversation going, to never say \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014just enough time to make it to the mosque for Friday prayer. I reached for my abaya, the one I always wore to the prayer hall, but today I hesitated. The office dress code was business casual, and my manager had already commented on my \u201cunusual\u201d attire. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be a confident, knowledgeable voice on the phone, and the need to dress modestly, to enter the prayer hall as my faith required. My heart pounded as I stood in the break room, abaya in hand, wondering if I could meet both demands without disappointing someone\u2014my boss, my faith, or myself."}
