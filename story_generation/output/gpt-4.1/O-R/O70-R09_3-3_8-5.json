The event was meant to be a break from my delivery route, a chance to connect with others, but my mind was split. My phone buzzed again\u2014a customer, anxious about a delayed package, wanted an update. I knew I had to respond quickly and professionally, but my stomach twisted as I glanced at the food. None of the dishes had kosher certification, and I couldn\u2019t find anything I could eat. My coworkers urged me to join in, not understanding why I hesitated. I felt the pressure to be polite and present, to reassure the customer and not let my team down, but also the weight of my own commitment to keeping kosher. My hands shook as I typed a careful reply to the customer, my hunger gnawing at me, my conscience torn between the expectations of my job and my faith."}
