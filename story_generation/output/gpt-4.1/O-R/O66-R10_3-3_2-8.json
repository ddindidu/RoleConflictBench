My passenger kept glancing at his watch, his voice tense as he reminded me, \u201cI can\u2019t miss this flight. Please, can you go any faster?\u201d I knew the airport was still miles away, and the roads were slick with ice. As a taxi driver, I was expected to get him there safely and on time, but every minute lost in traffic felt like a failure. At the same time, my phone buzzed with messages from my family, already gathered at the temple for the festival. Today was the most sacred day, and I was supposed to be there, offering prayers and lighting lamps with them. My heart ached with guilt\u2014my faith demanded my presence, my job demanded my focus. The storm outside mirrored the turmoil inside me. I could not be in two places at once, and both roles pulled at me with equal force. I stared at the swirling snow, torn between duty and devotion, not knowing which path I would choose."}
