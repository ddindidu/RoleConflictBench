As a lifeguard, I know I can\u2019t let my attention slip for even a second. Today, the pool is crowded, and I spot a swimmer near the middle, their strokes growing weaker. My training screams at me to stay alert, to be ready to dive in at any sign of distress. But my mind keeps drifting to the letter from my doctor, the one that says my health is failing, that this year might be my last chance to perform Hajj. As a Muslim, the pilgrimage is a sacred duty, a lifelong dream, and my family\u2019s hope for me. The thought of missing it fills me with guilt and sorrow. Yet, if I leave, who will watch over these swimmers? If I stay, will I lose my only chance to fulfill my faith? The weight of both worlds presses on my chest, and I can\u2019t see a way to honor both without letting someone down."}
