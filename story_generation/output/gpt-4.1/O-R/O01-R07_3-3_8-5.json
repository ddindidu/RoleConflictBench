As the architect in charge, everyone looks to me for quick decisions and calm leadership. My phone vibrates again, this time with a gentle reminder: the weekly meditation group meets at six, and I am to guide the session. As a Buddhist, I am expected to embody mindfulness, to be present and centered, especially when leading others in meditation. But my mind is anything but calm. I feel the weight of my team\u2019s expectations pressing on my chest, the need to resolve conflicts and keep the project on track. At the same time, I sense the pull of my spiritual commitment, the responsibility to create a peaceful space for others. My heart races as I stare at the two open windows on my computer\u2014one filled with urgent emails, the other with the meditation script. I close my eyes, caught between the demands of efficiency and the call to stillness, unsure which path to take."}
