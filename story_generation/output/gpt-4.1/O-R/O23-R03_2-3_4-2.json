My client\u2019s future depended on my preparation; they trusted me to defend their rights, to be their voice when it mattered most. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from the mayor\u2014hundreds displaced by the hurricane, families desperate for shelter and food. As a nun, I was expected to lead the relief effort, to be present, compassionate, and tireless in service. My sisters in the convent looked to me for guidance, and the community needed hope. My heart ached with the weight of both callings. I could not be in two places at once, and each role demanded my full devotion. The law required my mind; my faith required my hands. I stared at the storm outside my window, feeling the tempest within, torn between justice in the courtroom and mercy in the streets, knowing that whatever I chose, something precious would be left behind."}
