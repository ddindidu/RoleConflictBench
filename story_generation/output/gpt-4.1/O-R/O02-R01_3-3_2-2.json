My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from the project manager, reminding me that the entire build was waiting on my piece.

A member of my congregation was in crisis, desperate for guidance, their voice trembling with fear and uncertainty. They needed me to listen, to help them navigate a decision that could change the course of their life. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding my expertise and speed, the other my compassion and presence.
