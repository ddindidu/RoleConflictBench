My stomach rumbles\u2014lunchtime. Downstairs, the communal breakroom is buzzing; today\u2019s catered meal is a rare treat. I glance at the spread: trays of sandwiches, salads, and pastries, but none bear the kosher certification I rely on. My colleagues urge me to join, and I feel the weight of their expectation to be part of the team, to share in this small moment of camaraderie.\n\nJust then, a pilot\u2019s voice crackles through my headset, requesting the routine altimeter setting. I respond, my voice steady, but my mind is split. I\u2019m expected to be precise, focused, and available\u2014lives depend on it.
