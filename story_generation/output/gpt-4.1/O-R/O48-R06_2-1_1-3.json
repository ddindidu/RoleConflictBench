One of my patients, Mrs. Thompson, had just come out of surgery and needed extra help to get dressed and move around. The nurse reminded me how important it was to be gentle and patient, especially since she was still in pain. I could see the anxiety in Mrs. Thompson\u2019s eyes as I helped her sit up, and I knew she was counting on me to make her feel safe.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I realized Sunday worship would be starting soon. My church community always encouraged us to gather, to pray, and to support one another. I felt a tug in my heart, knowing how much I needed that spiritual nourishment and the sense of belonging. Yet, here I was, needed just as much by Mrs. Thompson. The expectations from both sides pressed in on me\u2014my duty to care for my patient and my longing to be present with my church family. I stood there, torn, my hands trembling slightly as I tried to focus on the task before me, wrestling with the impossible choice between compassion and faith."}
