My last client, Mrs. Evans, glared at her reflection, her voice rising with every complaint about her haircut. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I asked for! How could you get it so wrong?\u201d she snapped, drawing the attention of the other stylists. My training as a hairdresser told me to stay calm, listen, and do whatever I could to make her happy, even if it meant staying late. But tonight was Sunday, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d finally make it to church. I\u2019d missed so many services, always putting work first, and I felt the weight of that absence in my heart. My faith taught me to honor commitments to God and community, to find rest and renewal in worship. Yet here I was, torn between my duty to a dissatisfied client and my longing to reconnect with my church family. My hands trembled as I reached for my scissors, caught between the demands of my profession and the quiet call of my faith."}
