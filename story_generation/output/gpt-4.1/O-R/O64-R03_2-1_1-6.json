My fingers move quickly, scanning barcodes, counting change, offering polite smiles. As a cashier, I know accuracy is everything\u2014one mistake, and the whole system falters. But my mind keeps drifting to the quiet convent library, where I had planned to spend the afternoon in spiritual reading and reflection. As a nun, I am expected to nurture my soul, to find stillness and listen for God\u2019s voice. Yet here I am, surrounded by beeping scanners and hurried customers, my break time slipping away with every transaction. I feel torn\u2014my duty to the store demands my full attention, but my heart aches for the peace and purpose I find in prayer. The demands of the world and the call of my faith pull me in opposite directions, and I stand at the register, wrestling with the weight of both."}
