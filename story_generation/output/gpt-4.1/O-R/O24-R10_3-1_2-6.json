The clerk\u2019s voice was urgent: an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order, demanding my immediate attention. I knew the law required me to review every detail, to weigh the facts impartially and act swiftly. Yet, as I glanced out the window, the vibrant colors of the local Hindu festival caught my eye. The air was alive with music, the scent of incense drifting in. Today was a sacred day, and my family and community expected me to join the rituals, to honor our traditions and celebrate together.\n\nMy mind tugged in two directions. The judge in me felt the weight of responsibility\u2014justice could not wait. But the Hindu in me longed to step outside, to be part of the prayers and festivities, to fulfill my spiritual duties. I could almost hear my mother\u2019s gentle reminder: \u201cToday, we pray for blessings.\u201d My heart pounded as I stared at the case file, torn between the urgent call of justice and the pull of faith and belonging."}
