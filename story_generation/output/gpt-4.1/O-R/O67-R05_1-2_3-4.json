It was a reminder: the children\u2019s Torah class was about to begin at the synagogue. As a rabbi, I knew how much the parents and kids relied on me to guide them, to make the stories of our faith come alive. But as I held a half-empty box of gauze, I remembered the importance of my other duty\u2014if I missed something here, it could cost a life on the next call. My mind raced with the weight of both roles. The congregation expected me to be present, wise, and prepared to teach, while my ambulance team depended on my diligence and readiness. I felt torn, standing between the sacred texts and the sterile supplies, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
