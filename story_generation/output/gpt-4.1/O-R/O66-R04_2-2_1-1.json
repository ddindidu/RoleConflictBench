My train leaves in twenty minutes,\u201d he pleaded, his voice tight with worry. I nodded, feeling the weight of his urgency. As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get him to the station safely and on time. But as I turned onto the main road, my phone buzzed with a message from the mosque committee: \u201cBackup imam is sick. Everyone\u2019s waiting for you to lead the prayer.\u201d My heart pounded. The mosque was only a few blocks away, and the prayer was scheduled to start in ten minutes. I imagined the congregation gathering, expecting me to guide them in worship, relying on my presence. Yet here I was, responsible for a passenger who trusted me to get him to his train. Both roles demanded my full attention, both were urgent, and I felt torn in two, the steering wheel slick in my hands as I wrestled with what to do next."}
