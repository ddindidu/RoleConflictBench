My phone buzzed with messages from the construction site\u2014another delay, another conflict between teams. The project was already behind schedule, and as the lead architect, everyone looked to me to resolve it, to keep everything moving smoothly. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford another setback.\u201d I felt the weight of responsibility pressing down on my shoulders.\n\nThen, Sister Maria appeared at my office door, her face etched with concern. \u201cThe Johnsons lost everything in the fire last night. We\u2019re gathering food and clothes for them. Can you help?\u201d Her eyes searched mine, full of hope and expectation. As a nun, I was called to serve, to be present for those in need, especially in moments like this.
