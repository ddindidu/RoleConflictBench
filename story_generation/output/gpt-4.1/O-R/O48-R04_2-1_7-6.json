As a nursing assistant, I knew my presence mattered\u2014he needed reassurance, someone to listen to his fears about the pain and the long recovery ahead. I sat with him, offering gentle words and a calm presence, but my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Sister Amina, a member of my congregation. She wrote, \"Imam, if you have a moment today, I could really use your advice.\" I remembered her troubled expression at last Friday\u2019s prayer, and I knew she was struggling with something heavy. My heart pulled in two directions: Mr. Rahman\u2019s anxious eyes pleaded for comfort, while my duty as an imam called me to guide and support Sister Amina. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each expecting my full attention, each deserving it. My mind raced, torn between the hospital room and the needs of my community, unsure how to be present for both when they needed me most."}
