As a police officer, staying fit isn\u2019t just a personal goal\u2014it\u2019s a duty. My shift starts in a few hours, and I need to be at my best to protect the people in my precinct. Just as I grabbed my water bottle, my phone buzzed. It was Miriam, her voice trembling. \u201cRabbi, my father just passed. We need you for the funeral\u2014soon, please.\u201d My heart clenched. As their rabbi, I\u2019m the one they turn to in these moments, the one who brings comfort and tradition to their grief. But if I skip the gym, I risk not being at my best for my police duties. If I go, I let down a grieving family who needs their rabbi now. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, and I stood frozen, keys in one hand, phone in the other, torn between two worlds that both needed me\u2014right now."}
