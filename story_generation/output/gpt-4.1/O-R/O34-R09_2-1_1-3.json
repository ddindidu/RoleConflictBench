Holiday travel always brings chaos, and today the approach fixes are packed. My headset crackles with pilots\u2019 voices, each hoping for a break in the congestion. I\u2019m supposed to keep everything moving, minimize delays, and keep tempers cool. My stomach growls\u2014my shift started before sunrise, and I haven\u2019t eaten since. I reach for my lunch bag, but my hands tremble. The only kosher meal I packed is a cold sandwich, and I know I\u2019ll need more energy to get through the next few hours. There are snacks in the break room, but none are kosher. My supervisor expects me to stay sharp, focused, and ready to jump in if things get worse. But my faith expects me to keep kosher, even when it\u2019s inconvenient. I stare at the radar, my hunger gnawing at my resolve, and wonder how I can honor both the sky\u2019s demands and my own beliefs."}
