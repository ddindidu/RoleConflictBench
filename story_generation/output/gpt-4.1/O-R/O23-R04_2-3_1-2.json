My client\u2019s future depended on my careful review of the purchase agreement, every clause demanding my full attention. Yet, as I tried to focus, my phone buzzed with urgent messages from the mosque. A large crowd had gathered for a special remembrance, and I was the only one authorized to lead the prayer. The community expected my presence, my guidance, my voice to unite them in worship. My heart pounded as I stared at the contract, my mind torn between the duty to my client and the responsibility to my congregation. Both roles demanded my presence, my expertise, my care\u2014at the same time. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing down, the fear of letting someone down gnawing at me. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, knowing that whatever I decided, a part of me would be left behind."}
