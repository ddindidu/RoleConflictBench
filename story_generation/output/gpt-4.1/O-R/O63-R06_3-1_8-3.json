My headset itched against my ear as I listened to the monotone ring of another unanswered call. As a telemarketer, I was expected to stick to my schedule, take breaks only when allowed, and never let the automated compliance system catch me away from my desk. Even a minute of unscheduled downtime could mean a warning or worse. But as a Christian, Sunday worship was more than a routine\u2014it was a time to reconnect with my faith and my community, to sing, pray, and feel a sense of belonging. I could almost hear the hymns starting, the gentle murmur of prayers, and I longed to be there. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me of the strict rules. My pastor\u2019s words, too, about the importance of gathering together. My heart pounded as I hovered over the \u201clog out\u201d button, torn between the demands of my job and the pull of my faith, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
