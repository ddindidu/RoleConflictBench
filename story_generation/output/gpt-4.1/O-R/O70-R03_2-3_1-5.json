The grocery bags in the back seat rustled as I turned a corner, the address on my delivery app blinking urgently. The customer had called twice already, her voice tight with worry\u2014she needed the groceries for her family\u2019s dinner, and I\u2019d promised to be there within the hour. But my habit was folded neatly on the passenger seat, and my rosary beads tangled in my pocket, a reminder of the other promise I\u2019d made. Tonight, I was to lead the prayer vigil at the cathedral, representing my convent in front of hundreds. The sisters were counting on me, and I could already picture their hopeful faces, the gentle pressure of their expectations. My phone buzzed again: a reminder for the vigil, and another message from the customer. I felt torn, the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders. I gripped the steering wheel, caught between the urgent needs of a stranger and the sacred duty to my faith community, unsure which road to take."}
