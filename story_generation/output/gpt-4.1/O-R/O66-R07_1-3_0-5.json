My passenger, a young man with a relaxed smile, slides into the back seat and tells me he\u2019s heading to a caf\u00e9 across town. \u201cNo rush,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of time.\u201d I nod, but my mind is already racing. Today is my turn to lead the weekly meditation at the temple, and the session starts in just over an hour. I promised the group I\u2019d be there early to prepare the space, to set the incense and cushions, to greet everyone with calm presence. \n\nAs I drive, I feel the tension coil in my chest. The traffic lights seem longer than usual, and every slow-moving car ahead of me feels like a personal test. I want to offer my passenger a smooth, unhurried ride, to embody the patience I preach as a Buddhist. But the minutes tick by, and I can\u2019t help but worry about letting down my fellow practitioners. My hands grip the wheel tighter. I try to focus on my breath, but the competing demands pull me in opposite directions, and I wonder which role I must disappoint today."}
