Today, though, the weight of Ramadan pressed on me more than usual. I glanced at my phone\u2014midway through the holy month, and I was already behind on my daily Quran reading. The guilt gnawed at me; I had promised myself to keep up, to honor this sacred time with discipline and reflection. But just as I found a quiet corner to recite, the supervisor\u2019s voice echoed through the loudspeaker, calling all operators to the mandatory pre-shift briefing. New procedures, he said, and attendance was non-negotiable. My heart pounded. As a subway operator, I was expected to be punctual, attentive, and fully briefed\u2014lives depended on it. But as a Muslim, I felt the pull of my faith, the need to pause, recite, and reconnect. The two worlds collided in that moment, each demanding my full presence, and I stood there, torn, the Quran in my hand and the call to duty in my ear, unsure which path to take."}
