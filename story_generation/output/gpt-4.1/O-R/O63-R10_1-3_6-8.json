The call volume was unusually light today, and my supervisor had just sent a message reminding us that we could take our breaks whenever we wanted, as long as we logged them. My phone buzzed with a message from my cousin: \u201cWe\u2019re starting the puja in an hour. Don\u2019t be late!\u201d My family had traveled across the state for this festival, and I knew how important it was to be present for every ritual, every offering. As a Hindu, participating fully in these ceremonies was not just expected\u2014it was a way to honor my faith and my family. But as a telemarketer, I was supposed to stick to my scheduled hours, even if the rules were relaxed today. I felt the pressure mounting inside me, torn between the rare chance to be with my family for the festival and the responsibility to my job. My finger hovered over the \u201clog break\u201d button, my heart pounding as I weighed the expectations of my work against the pull of my faith."}
