The national continuing education program was in full swing, and I was eager to learn about the latest treatments\u2014after all, staying updated was not just a professional expectation, but a requirement to keep my license. The speaker began discussing a new medication, one that promised remarkable results for a certain condition. As the details unfolded, my heart sank. The drug\u2019s primary use was in a treatment that conflicted with my Christian beliefs, something I had always felt strongly about. \n\nI felt the weight of two worlds pressing in on me. As a pharmacist, I was expected to embrace new therapies and provide the best care for my patients, no matter what. But as a Christian, I was called to live by my faith, to uphold values that sometimes ran counter to the world\u2019s expectations. My mind raced with questions\u2014could I recommend this treatment? Would I be betraying my faith if I did? The pressure from both sides was suffocating, and I could feel my hands trembling as I tried to steady my thoughts, caught between my duty to my profession and my commitment to my faith."}
