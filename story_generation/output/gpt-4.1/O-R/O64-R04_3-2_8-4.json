My manager\u2019s eyes flick to me, silently urging me to keep the line moving. A customer slams her groceries on the counter, her voice sharp with frustration about a coupon that won\u2019t scan. I force a smile, trying to stay calm and helpful, even as my heart pounds. I know I need to be patient, to offer the friendly service expected of me, especially during this holiday rush. But my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a reminder that I am the only imam scheduled for today\u2019s Friday sermon. The community is expecting me; the topic has been announced, and people are gathering, waiting for my words. I feel the weight of their trust, the responsibility to guide and inspire. My mind races between the demands of my job and my duty to my faith community. I glance at the clock, feeling the minutes slip away, torn between the expectations of my customers and my congregation, unsure which role I can afford to let down."}
