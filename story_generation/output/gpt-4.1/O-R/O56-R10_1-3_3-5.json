I nodded, reaching for my scissors, when I noticed something odd in the reflection\u2014a coworker slipping cash from the register into his pocket. My heart pounded. As a hairdresser, I\u2019m expected to keep my clients happy, to focus on their needs and make sure they leave satisfied. But as a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, to never ignore wrongdoing. My hands trembled slightly as I combed Mrs. Patel\u2019s hair, torn between addressing her request and confronting the theft I\u2019d just witnessed. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my attention, each pulling me in a different direction."}
