The order slip was clear: these boxes needed to reach the cardiac unit by noon, no exceptions. I could already picture the nurses waiting, the patients depending on this delivery. But as I handed over the first box, my phone buzzed with a reminder: Friday prayer was in less than an hour. I was the only imam scheduled, and the community had been looking forward to my sermon all week. My topic\u2014hope in adversity\u2014was already posted on the mosque\u2019s notice board. I imagined the congregation gathering, expecting my words to guide them. My heart pounded as I weighed the hospital\u2019s need for these supplies against the spiritual needs of my community. Both roles demanded my presence, both were urgent, and I felt the pressure mounting inside me, torn between two worlds that needed me at the same time."}
