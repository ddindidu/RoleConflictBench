My hands tremble as I grip the radio, knowing protocol demands I report and halt the train immediately. Passengers\u2019 safety and the city\u2019s schedule rest on my shoulders. But my mind drifts to my son, sitting at home with the Torah open, struggling to recite his bar mitzvah portion. The ceremony is days away, and he\u2019s anxious, looking to me for guidance, for the lessons and reassurance I promised to give. I feel the weight of my ancestors, the expectation to pass on our traditions, to be present and nurturing. Yet here I am, responsible for hundreds of lives, unable to leave, torn between duty to my passengers and duty to my child. The radio crackles, demanding my attention, while my phone vibrates with a message from home: \u201cHe needs you.\u201d My heart aches, caught between two worlds, each demanding all of me, and I don\u2019t know which call to answer first."}
