The clock ticked closer to noon, the time I was expected to lead the daily prayer at the chapel downstairs. It was a routine service, not mandatory, but the congregation\u2014small as it was\u2014looked to me for guidance and comfort. My phone buzzed with a reminder, and I felt the familiar tug of responsibility.\n\nJust then, a blip on the screen caught my attention. An aircraft was approaching the boundary, ready to cross into the neighboring sector. I needed to coordinate with the next controller, confirm the handoff, and ensure the airspace remained safe and orderly. My colleague glanced over, sensing my distraction, but I knew the expectation: no lapses, no mistakes.\n\nMy heart pounded as I weighed the demands. The chapel would be waiting, the congregation expecting my presence and words. But here, in the tower, lives depended on my focus. I stared at the clock, torn between the sacred and the sky, feeling the pressure of both worlds closing in."}
