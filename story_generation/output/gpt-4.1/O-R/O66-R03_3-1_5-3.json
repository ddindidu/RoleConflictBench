The morning sun glinted off the taxi\u2019s hood as I navigated the familiar route, my mind already drifting to the chapel where the sisters would soon gather for morning prayers. The clock on the dashboard blinked insistently\u2014if I didn\u2019t hurry, I\u2019d miss the service, a sacred duty I\u2019d never taken lightly. But as I turned the corner, a construction detour forced all traffic into a single, narrow lane. Up ahead, a cluster of children waited at the curb, their backpacks bright against the gray sidewalk. The urge to speed up tugged at me, the pressure of the convent\u2019s expectations heavy on my shoulders. Yet, as a taxi driver, I knew the law: slow down, be vigilant, protect those children at all costs. My heart pounded, torn between the call of the chapel bell and the responsibility to keep my passengers\u2014and those children\u2014safe. I pressed my foot gently on the brake, caught in the tension between devotion and duty, uncertain which path to choose."}
