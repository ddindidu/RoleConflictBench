Her hair was still damp, the scent of her own shampoo lingering. \u201cI just washed it at home,\u201d she smiled, \u201cso you can skip the wash.\u201d My training and the salon\u2019s policy echoed in my mind\u2014every client\u2019s hair must be washed and conditioned here, no exceptions. I glanced at the clock, aware of the next appointment waiting. \n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mark, a member of my congregation. \u201cCan you talk? It\u2019s urgent,\u201d he wrote. I knew he\u2019d been struggling with his son\u2019s addiction, and as his pastor, I was expected to be available, to offer comfort and guidance whenever needed. \n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing in. The salon expected me to follow protocol, to treat every client the same. My calling as a pastor demanded compassion and presence, especially in moments of crisis. My hands trembled slightly as I tried to decide what to do next, torn between the rules of my workplace and the needs of my community."}
