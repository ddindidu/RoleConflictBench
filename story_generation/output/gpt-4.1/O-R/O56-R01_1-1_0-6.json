The receptionist was at the desk, ready to greet her, but Mrs. Lee looked straight at me, expecting our usual friendly banter. I knew she came not just for a trim, but for the comfort of our conversations. As I set down my broom, I remembered the community gathering later that afternoon, where I was scheduled to share a religious story\u2014something uplifting, something that would guide others in faith. My mind raced with the weight of both roles. Here, I was expected to be the welcoming hairdresser, making clients feel at home, while in just a few hours, I\u2019d need to embody the pastor, teaching principles and offering spiritual guidance. The receptionist glanced at me, waiting to see if I\u2019d step in, while Mrs. Lee\u2019s eyes sparkled with anticipation. I felt the tug between being present for her as a hairdresser and preparing myself mentally for my pastoral duties. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I stood there, caught between the comfort of the salon and the calling of the pulpit, unsure which role to embrace in that moment."}
