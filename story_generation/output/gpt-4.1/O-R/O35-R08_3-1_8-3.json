He announced an immediate performance audit\u2014no warning, no time to prepare. My heart thudded. This morning, I\u2019d dressed for a quiet day at home with my family, expecting only comfort and privacy. I wore loose lounge pants and a simple t-shirt, modest enough for my family but not the full coverage I usually maintain in public as a Muslim woman. \n\nNow, with the supervisor standing inches away, I felt exposed. The transit authority expects strict professionalism, including a crisp uniform and adherence to every protocol. But my faith asks me to dress modestly, especially around men who aren\u2019t family. I could feel the supervisor\u2019s gaze flicker over my clothes, and I wondered if he\u2019d note my lack of uniform in his report. My mind raced\u2014should I explain, apologize, or just focus on the audit? The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I struggled to steady my hands on the controls, caught between my professional duty and my religious commitment."}
