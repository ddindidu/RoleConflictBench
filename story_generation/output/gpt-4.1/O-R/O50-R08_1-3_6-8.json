It was a new client, her voice uncertain as she asked for some basic tips on using the machine I\u2019d just installed. As a machine repairer, I knew my job wasn\u2019t just fixing things\u2014it was making sure clients felt confident and safe. She was counting on me to guide her, and I could hear the anxiety in her questions. But my mind kept drifting to the pilgrimage. The doctor\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cIf you want to go, this year is your best chance.\u201d As a Muslim, performing Hajj is a sacred duty, and I\u2019d waited years for this moment. Now, with my health in question, the pressure to fulfill this obligation felt heavier than ever. I stared at the calendar, torn between the immediate needs of my client and the once-in-a-lifetime call of faith. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t meet both expectations at once."}
