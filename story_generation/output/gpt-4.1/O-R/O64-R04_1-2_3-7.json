There was a small discrepancy\u2014just a few dollars off. Store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, no matter how minor. My manager expected me to report even the smallest error, but the line of customers was growing, and I knew the paperwork would take time. My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Brother Ahmed, a long-time congregant. He sounded desperate, asking if I could meet him soon. He said his family was falling apart, and he needed guidance. As an imam, I was supposed to be there for my community, to offer comfort and counsel when they needed it most. But right now, I was a cashier, responsible for the store\u2019s money and following every rule. My heart pounded as I stared at the register, torn between the duty to my job and the call to serve someone in spiritual crisis."}
