My duty was clear: keep the peace, enforce the law, and ensure no one got hurt. Yet, as I scanned the crowd, I spotted Ahmed, a regular at the mosque, weaving through the chaos toward me. Earlier that week, he\u2019d mentioned wanting to talk\u2014something about his family, his faith, his worries. \u201cWhenever you have time, Imam,\u201d he\u2019d said, eyes hopeful. Now, as the tension between the groups threatened to boil over, Ahmed caught my eye, silently pleading for a moment. My colleagues expected me to focus, to be the officer ready to act. But Ahmed needed his imam, someone to listen, to guide. The weight of my badge pressed against my chest, while the memory of my robe felt distant but no less real. I stood rooted, torn between the law I swore to uphold and the spiritual care I promised to provide, my heart pounding as the demands of both worlds collided within me."}
