She clutched a blender, no receipt in sight. \u201cI lost everything in the flood,\u201d she whispered, voice cracking. \u201cCan I return this? I need the money for food.\u201d My training as a cashier echoed in my mind: no returns without a receipt, no exceptions. The manager watched from across the store, expecting me to uphold policy. But as a pastor, I knew Mrs. Carter from church. I\u2019d prayed with her just last night, promising our community would help her through this crisis. Now, she looked to me for compassion, for support. My heart ached, torn between the rules I was paid to enforce and the calling to care for those in need. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders, the store\u2019s expectations clashing with my pastoral vows. I hesitated, caught in the impossible space between policy and mercy, knowing whatever I chose would betray one part of myself."}
