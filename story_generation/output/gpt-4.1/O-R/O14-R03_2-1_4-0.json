The departmental meeting is in two hours, and my supervisor expects a clear, honest report of our preliminary results. I know the importance of accuracy\u2014science demands it, and my reputation depends on it. Yet, my phone vibrates with a gentle reminder: the convent\u2019s monthly food drive starts in thirty minutes. As a nun, I am counted on to help prepare meals and offer comfort to those who come seeking warmth and kindness. The sisters rely on my presence, and the faces of the people we serve linger in my mind. My heart aches with the weight of both callings. I feel torn, knowing that to fulfill one expectation means letting down the other. The lab\u2019s fluorescent lights hum above me, while the memory of the chapel\u2019s quiet peace tugs at my conscience. I close my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, the demands of truth and compassion pulling me in opposite directions."}
