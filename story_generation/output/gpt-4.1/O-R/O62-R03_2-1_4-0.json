As I walked along the edge, I noticed a lane rope had snapped, its frayed ends floating in the water. If I didn\u2019t fix it soon, the lessons would be chaotic, and the children\u2019s safety could be at risk. I knelt down, already planning how to repair it, when my phone buzzed\u2014a gentle reminder from Sister Agnes. Today was the monthly food drive at the convent, and my presence was expected. The sisters counted on me to help organize the donations and greet the families who came for support. I felt the weight of both uniforms\u2014the whistle around my neck, the habit folded in my bag. The pool needed me, but so did the shelter. My heart pounded as I stood between the two worlds, torn by the demands of duty and compassion, knowing I could not be in both places at once."}
