The contract from my client was routine, nothing urgent, but I prided myself on thoroughness. I wanted to get ahead, to show my client that their business mattered. As I began to mark up the first page, my phone buzzed. It was the church secretary\u2014someone had arrived, desperate and in tears, asking for me by name. My mind split in two. As a lawyer, I felt the weight of my client\u2019s trust, the expectation that I would be diligent and timely. But as a priest, I knew the pain of those who come seeking comfort, the sacred duty to be present in their darkest hour. My heart pounded as I stared at the contract, then at the door, feeling the pull of both worlds. I could not ignore either call, yet I could not be in two places at once. The pressure built inside me, a silent plea for guidance as I wrestled with which part of myself to honor first."}
