Can I return it?\u201d she pleaded. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo returns without a receipt, no exceptions.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014almost time for my break, but my phone buzzed with a message from the parish secretary: \u201cThe Martinez family needs you for their child\u2019s final sacrament prep. They can only meet tonight.\u201d I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on me\u2014the crisp apron and the white collar. The store demanded strict adherence to policy, but as a priest, I was expected to be compassionate, to help families in need, especially at such a pivotal moment in their faith journey. The woman\u2019s hopeful eyes met mine, and I felt torn. Should I bend the rules for her, risking my job, or uphold the policy and risk failing a family who needed spiritual guidance? My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t satisfy both worlds at once."}
