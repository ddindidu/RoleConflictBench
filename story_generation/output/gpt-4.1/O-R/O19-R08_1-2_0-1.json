The label matched the medication, and I double-checked the dosage, as I always did. Accuracy was everything here\u2014patients trusted me with their health, and I couldn\u2019t let a single detail slip. But as I handed the medicine over, my mind drifted to the Quran resting in my bag. Ramadan was halfway through, and I was already behind on my daily reading. Each night, exhaustion tugged at my eyelids before I could finish my quota, and guilt gnawed at me for not giving the Quran the attention it deserved. My community expected devotion, especially now, and I felt the weight of their silent hopes. Yet, every moment I spent reflecting on the Quran was a moment away from the relentless pace of the pharmacy, where a single mistake could have real consequences. I felt torn, standing between the counter and my faith, the demands of my profession and my religion pulling me in opposite directions."}
