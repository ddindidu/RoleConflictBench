Mrs. Evans had called in a panic last night\u2014her deck was splintered and unsafe, and her grandchildren were visiting today. She needed it fixed before they arrived. As a carpenter, I knew the responsibility: people counted on me to keep their homes safe and sound. I promised her I\u2019d be there first thing.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. Church service would start in an hour. As a Christian, I was expected to be present, to worship, to show my commitment to God and my community. Missing service wasn\u2019t just about me; it meant letting down my church family, too.\n\nI stood in the driveway, keys in hand, torn between the urgent call of my craft and the quiet pull of my faith. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each demanding my presence, each feeling like a test of who I truly was."}
