The emergency motion demanded my immediate attention; as a judge, I was expected to review every detail, weigh the arguments, and deliver a ruling within the hour. My phone buzzed.

Without me, the service couldn\u2019t proceed, and the grieving family would be left waiting, their pain prolonged. My mind raced. The law demanded my focus, but my faith called me to stand with my community in their hour of need. I felt the weight of the black robe on my shoulders, the silent pull of my kippah beneath it.
