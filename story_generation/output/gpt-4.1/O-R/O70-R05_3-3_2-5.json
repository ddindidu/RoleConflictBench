The hospital\u2019s address blinked on my delivery app, a red warning flashing: \u201cCritical\u2014medical supplies, urgent.\u201d I knew what was in the back of my van\u2014specialized medication, needed for a patient\u2019s treatment. I was already running behind, traffic thicker than usual. My phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message from Miriam, the conversion candidate. \u201cRabbi, I\u2019m so nervous. Will you be there for our final session before the Beit Din?\u201d I could picture her anxious face, the months of study and hope riding on this last meeting. I was supposed to be at the synagogue in twenty minutes, to guide her through the final questions, to reassure her, to fulfill my promise as her rabbi. But the hospital was in the opposite direction, and the clock was ticking for both deliveries\u2014one of medicine, one of faith. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, torn between the urgent needs of my two worlds, each demanding my presence, each expecting me not to fail."}
