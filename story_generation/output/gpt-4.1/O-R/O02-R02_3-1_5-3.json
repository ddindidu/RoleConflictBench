His voice was stern, urgent\u2014there were safety concerns that couldn\u2019t wait. If I didn\u2019t address them immediately, the entire project could be shut down. My mind raced through the checklist of regulations, the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders. As I hung up, my phone buzzed again. This time, it was a gentle message from a parishioner, asking if we could meet soon to talk. Nothing urgent, just a need for guidance, but I could sense the vulnerability behind the words. I felt the pull from both worlds: the engineer in me demanded swift, precise action to protect lives and livelihoods; the priest in me longed to offer comfort and presence to someone reaching out. The expectations clashed inside me, each role insisting on its own kind of urgency. My heart pounded as I stared at the two messages, torn between the call to duty and the call to compassion, knowing I could not fully serve both at once."}
