My sales numbers blinked on the screen\u2014already ahead of target, my manager\u2019s praise still echoing from this morning. I should have felt proud, but my mind kept drifting to my friend, Priya. She\u2019d confided in me about a colleague manipulating her sales, taking credit for her work. I could see the stress in her eyes, the way she avoided the break room now. As a Hindu, I was raised to value dharma\u2014doing what\u2019s right, standing up for justice. But here, in this office, the unspoken rule was to keep your head down, focus on your own numbers, and not rock the boat. If I spoke up, I risked my own standing, maybe even my job. If I stayed silent, I\u2019d betray my values and my friend. The phone rang again, another potential sale, but my heart pounded with the weight of the choice before me."}
