My heart pounds\u2014I know today\u2019s audit could determine my future on this line. I grip the controls, focusing on every signal, every stop, determined to follow every protocol to the letter. Suddenly, the intercom crackles. A passenger in the last car is panicking, her voice trembling as she pleads for help\u2014her child is missing. My training says to keep the train moving, stay on schedule, and let the platform staff handle it. But my faith tugs at me, reminding me of Jesus\u2019 call to care for the lost and frightened, to show compassion even when it\u2019s inconvenient. The supervisor\u2019s gaze is unyielding, expecting flawless adherence to the rules. My hands sweat on the controls. I feel torn\u2014between the duty to my job and the deeper duty to love my neighbor. The train slows for the next station, and I know I have only seconds to choose which expectation I will meet."}
