As I drive my taxi through the city, the sun is just beginning to warm the streets. My phone buzzes with a new ride request\u2014someone needs to get to the airport, and they\u2019re running late. I glance at the clock. If I accept, I\u2019ll have to miss church service again. My pastor has gently reminded me how important it is to be present, not just for worship but for the fellowship and support I can offer others. But as a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to be reliable, to follow the rules, and to get my passengers where they need to go safely. The roads are clear, but the temptation to speed tugs at me, knowing it might help my passenger make their flight and earn me a good tip. My heart aches with the weight of these expectations\u2014my duty to my job, and my commitment to my faith community. I grip the steering wheel, torn between the demands of the road and the call of the church bells, unsure which path to take."}
