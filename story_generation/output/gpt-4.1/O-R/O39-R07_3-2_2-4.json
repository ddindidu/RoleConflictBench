We need you to guide this beam\u2014now!\u201d I dropped my shovel, heart pounding as the crane\u2019s load swayed above us. My hands itched to help, to do my part, to keep the site moving and my coworkers safe. But my phone buzzed in my pocket: a gentle reminder for the weekly meditation. The sangha would be gathering in the quiet room, incense curling in the air, everyone settling into stillness. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss it again. My mind tugged in two directions\u2014one toward the urgent, physical demand of the job, the other toward the calm, mindful presence I\u2019d been cultivating. Sweat beaded on my brow, not just from the sun, but from the pressure of these clashing worlds. I could almost hear the chanting, feel the peace waiting for me, even as the foreman\u2019s shout echoed, \u201cWe can\u2019t wait!\u201d My breath caught, torn between the steel and the silence."}
