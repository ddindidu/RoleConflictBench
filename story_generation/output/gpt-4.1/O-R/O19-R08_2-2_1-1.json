Mr. Rahman\u2019s chart is complicated\u2014hypertension, diabetes, and a new medication for his heart. I know how much he depends on me to get this right. My mind is sharp, but my body feels the weight of fasting. It\u2019s Ramadan, and I promised myself I\u2019d finish a juz\u2019 of Quran each day, but I\u2019m already behind. The guilt tugs at me; I should be reciting, reflecting, not just rushing through the words. Yet here I am, counting pills, cross-referencing interactions, my focus split. My heart aches with the desire to honor my faith, to catch up on my readings, but my hands are needed here, ensuring Mr. Rahman\u2019s safety. The clock ticks closer to Maghrib, and I feel the pressure mounting\u2014my duty to my patient, my duty to my Creator. I close my eyes for a moment, torn between the two worlds, unsure which to serve first."}
