The file for next week\u2019s case sits on my desk, thick with documents that demand my attention. My clerk reminds me that the preliminary review should be done soon, so I can be prepared for any unexpected issues. Yet, as a Hindu, this week is sacred\u2014my family and I have planned for months to travel to the temple for the festival. It\u2019s not just a tradition; it\u2019s a spiritual necessity, a time to reconnect with my faith and community. The rituals require my full presence, both physically and mentally. As I pack my bags, the weight of the unopened file tugs at my conscience. I feel torn\u2014my duty to the court and my devotion to my faith pulling me in opposite directions. The expectations are clear, but the path forward is anything but."}
