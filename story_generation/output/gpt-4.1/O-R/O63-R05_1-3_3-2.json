My sales numbers are already ahead of target this week, but management\u2019s emails keep coming\u2014reminders to push harder, to not let up, to set an example. I know I could close a few more deals before the day ends, maybe even break a personal record. But as I hang up, my phone buzzes with a reminder: the High Holiday sermon. The congregation expects inspiration, guidance, something meaningful for the service that\u2019s only two days away. I haven\u2019t written a word. My mind is split\u2014should I keep dialing, riding the momentum, or turn my attention to the sacred responsibility waiting for me? The pressure from my manager\u2019s expectations weighs on one side, the spiritual needs of my community on the other. I stare at my blank notepad, heart pounding, torn between the demands of my livelihood and my calling."}
