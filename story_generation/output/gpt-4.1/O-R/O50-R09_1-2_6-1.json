It\u2019s a new client, her voice bright but uncertain, asking if I can walk her through the basics of the new machine. I glance at the clock\u2014barely an hour before I promised the children we\u2019d gather to practice the blessings for the holiday. She\u2019s eager, and I know how overwhelming these machines can be at first. My job is to make sure clients feel supported, to answer questions and guide them, even if it means staying on the line longer than planned. But the children are waiting, and the holiday is almost here. They still stumble over the words, and I feel the weight of passing on our traditions, of making sure they understand not just the words but the meaning behind them. My mind races, torn between the responsibility to my client and the promise I made to my family, both expecting me to be present, to guide, to teach."}
