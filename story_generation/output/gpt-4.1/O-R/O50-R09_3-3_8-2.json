The supervisor waved me over, worry creasing his brow. \u201cThe new staff are about to start the next batch, but they\u2019re not clear on the safety steps. Can you walk them through it?\u201d I glanced at the clock. My son\u2019s bar mitzvah was just days away, and he still stumbled over the Torah portion. My wife had called earlier, her voice tight: \u201cHe needs you to help him practice tonight. He\u2019s nervous.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. The staff looked at me expectantly, waiting for guidance that could prevent disaster. At the same time, I pictured my son\u2019s anxious face, the importance of passing on our traditions, the pride and responsibility of being his teacher. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need to keep these workers safe and the equally urgent need to be there for my child, to uphold my role as a Jewish parent. The clock ticked louder, and I stood frozen, caught between two worlds that needed me, unsure which to choose."}
