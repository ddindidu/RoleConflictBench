A user had reported a minor UI glitch\u2014nothing catastrophic, but it nagged at me. The workaround was simple, but I knew my team expected a permanent fix, and I prided myself on thoroughness. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, ready to dive in, when the chapel bell tolled, its sound echoing through the halls. It was time for morning prayer, a sacred part of our daily rhythm, and my sisters would expect me to be present, kneeling in silent devotion.\n\nMy heart pounded with the familiar tug-of-war. The world outside demanded my technical expertise, my commitment to excellence. Inside these walls, I was called to humility, to set aside worldly concerns and join my sisters in prayer. I glanced at the clock, feeling the pressure mount. If I left now, the bug would linger, my team might be disappointed, and users would continue to stumble. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss the prayer, betraying the discipline and unity of our community. My hands trembled as I closed my eyes, caught between two worlds, unsure which to serve in this moment."}
