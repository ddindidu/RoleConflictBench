Mrs. Goldstein sat across from me, her pill bottles lined up like soldiers. She was starting a new blood thinner, and her list of medications was long and tangled. I knew how crucial it was to walk her through every interaction, every warning\u2014her safety depended on it. But as I explained the risks, my phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight\u2019s synagogue service. My father always said, \u201cWe show up for our community, even when it\u2019s inconvenient.\u201d I pictured the familiar faces, the gentle hum of prayer, the comfort of tradition. Yet here I was, torn. My duty as a pharmacist demanded my full attention for Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s sake, but my heart ached at the thought of missing the service, of letting down my family and faith. The minutes ticked by, each one tightening the knot in my chest as I wrestled with the weight of both worlds, unsure which expectation I could bear to disappoint."}
