My job required me to hand-deliver it directly to the recipient and verify their identity\u2014no exceptions, especially for something this sensitive. But as a Muslim, I knew the main prayer hall was a sacred space, and I was expected to dress modestly before entering, especially on Friday for congregational worship. Today, I was still in my delivery uniform: short sleeves, company cap, and work pants. I could already see people gathering inside, dressed in their best, ready for prayer. My heart pounded as I realized I would have to step inside like this to find the recipient. I imagined the stares, the silent judgment, the feeling of disrespecting a place I held dear. Yet, my job demanded I complete the delivery in person, no matter the setting. I hesitated at the threshold, torn between my professional duty and my religious obligation, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
