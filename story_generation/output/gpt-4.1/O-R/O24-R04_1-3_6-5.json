As a judge, I know I must stay current\u2014my rulings depend on it. Yet, the clock ticks closer to Friday noon, and the mosque is already filling. Today is not just any Friday; it marks a milestone for our community, and people have come from distant towns to hear my sermon. As their imam, they expect guidance, inspiration, and a sense of unity. My mind races with the weight of both roles. I long to immerse myself in the journal, to sharpen my legal mind, but I also feel the pull of the congregation\u2019s anticipation. The expectations press in from both sides, and I find myself torn, heart pounding, as I stand between the world of law and the world of faith, unable to give either the full attention it deserves."}
