I\u2019ve been with your company for years!\u201d My script fluttered uselessly in my hand. I was supposed to stay calm, answer every question, and keep him on the line. My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t let them go until you\u2019ve addressed every concern.\u201d But my eyes kept darting to the clock. In less than an hour, I was supposed to sit with my son, helping him practice his Torah portion for his bar mitzvah. He was struggling, and I\u2019d promised him I\u2019d be there tonight, no matter what. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the patient teacher, the parent who passed on our traditions, not just the voice on the phone. But Mr. Feldman was still waiting, demanding answers, and my supervisor was watching. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing down, and I didn\u2019t know which expectation I could afford to let down."}
