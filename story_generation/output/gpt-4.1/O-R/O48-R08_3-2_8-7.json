Tears streamed down her face after the doctor left, the weight of her diagnosis pressing down on both of us. As a nursing assistant, I knew my place was here\u2014offering comfort, listening, and being present for her in this moment of fear and loneliness. She needed me, and I could see it in her eyes.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket, a message from my friends: \u201cTickets are almost gone! Are you coming to Hajj with us this year?\u201d My heart ached. I had saved for years, dreaming of fulfilling this pillar of my faith, and now the opportunity was here. My family and community expected me to go, to answer the call of Allah. Yet, how could I leave now, when my patients needed me most? The two worlds pulled at me, each demanding my presence, my heart, my time. I felt torn, standing in that quiet hospital room, wrestling with the impossible choice between my duty to my patients and my devotion to my faith."}
