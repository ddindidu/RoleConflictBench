I stood behind the register, counting the day\u2019s cash, my mind focused on the deposit procedures. Every bill had to be double-checked, every form signed\u2014corporate was strict, and I couldn\u2019t afford a mistake. As I started the paperwork, I noticed Mrs. Jenkins, a regular customer and member of my congregation, lingering by the door. Her shoulders slumped, eyes red. I remembered the prayer request she\u2019d sent last night, about her loneliness since her husband passed. As her pastor, I felt the urge to step away, offer a gentle word, maybe a prayer. But the deposit couldn\u2019t wait; if I left, I\u2019d break store policy and risk my job. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014one bound by rules and responsibility, the other by compassion and faith. I gripped the pen tighter, feeling the weight of both uniforms I wore, unsure which one I could take off, even for a moment."}
