The quarterly filing deadline loomed, and I knew my manager expected every figure to be perfect\u2014no errors, no delays. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the community Quran study circle would begin in half an hour. I hadn\u2019t read the assigned verses yet, and I felt a pang of guilt. As a Muslim, I was expected to come prepared, to recite and reflect sincerely, not just show up. But the financial records still needed my attention, and I could already imagine the disappointment in my manager\u2019s eyes if I missed the deadline. My heart pounded as I weighed the importance of my faith against my professional responsibilities. Both roles demanded my full presence, but I only had one evening to give. I sat frozen, torn between the glowing screen and the Quran on my desk, feeling the pressure of expectations pulling me in opposite directions."}
