As a doctor, I was expected to act swiftly\u2014my patient in room 12 was fighting a raging infection, and only a potent antibiotic could halt its spread. The medical team looked to me for a decision, their eyes urgent, trusting. Yet, my phone buzzed with a message from the convent: Mother Superior reminding me of the spiritual retreat, where I was to lead daily reflections, guiding my sisters in faith and contemplation. The retreat was sacred, a time for deep spiritual renewal, and my absence would disappoint the community and perhaps even be seen as neglecting my vows. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding immediate action to save a life, the other calling me to nurture the souls of my sisters. My heart pounded as I stood between the sterile light of the ER and the quiet sanctuary of the chapel, torn by the impossible expectations of healer and servant of God."}
