I smiled, welcoming them, trying to ease their tension. As a hairdresser, it\u2019s my job to make clients feel at home, especially on a day as important as this. I offered them tea, complimented the bride\u2019s dress, and listened to their anxious chatter about the tight schedule. \n\nBut then, as I started on the bride\u2019s hair, one of her friends pulled me aside. She quietly asked if I could help cover up a tattoo on the bride\u2019s neck\u2014a symbol from a wild night, something the bride\u2019s conservative family mustn\u2019t see. She offered extra cash, urging me to keep it secret. \n\nMy hands trembled. As a Christian, honesty and integrity are core to who I am. I felt the weight of their expectation to help, to be discreet, to make the day perfect. But I also felt the pull of my faith, the call to truthfulness and not to aid in deception. My heart pounded as I stood between my scissors and my conscience, unsure which role I could bear to disappoint."}
