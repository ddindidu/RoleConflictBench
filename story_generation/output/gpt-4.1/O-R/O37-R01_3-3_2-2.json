My supervisor had just reminded me that every corner needed to be spotless today\u2014no exceptions. The pressure to meet the new cleanliness standards weighed on me; I could already picture her checking behind the radiators and under the beds. As I rolled up my sleeves, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Maria, a member of my congregation. She was in tears, desperate for guidance, her world unraveling after a painful discovery. She needed me now, not later\u2014her text made that clear. I stared at the bucket, then at my phone, heart pounding. The expectation to be present, to offer comfort and wisdom as her pastor, clashed with the immediate demand to scrub and sanitize every inch of this house. Both roles called to me with urgency, and I felt myself pulled in two, guilt and anxiety rising as I tried to decide which duty to answer first."}
