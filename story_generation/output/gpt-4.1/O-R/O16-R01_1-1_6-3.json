As her doctor, I knew the protocol: examine, test, prescribe antibiotics if necessary. My mind cataloged her symptoms, but my heart tugged elsewhere. Just this morning, I\u2019d heard that her husband, a quiet man from our congregation, had lost his job. As her pastor, I was expected to offer comfort, to ask about her spirit, to remind her she wasn\u2019t alone. But as her doctor, I was supposed to focus on her physical health, keep boundaries, and not blur the lines. I could see the worry in her eyes\u2014was it just the illness, or something deeper? My hands hovered over the prescription pad, but my words caught in my throat. Should I ask about her family, offer a prayer, or keep the visit strictly medical? The expectations of both my callings pressed in, and I felt the weight of choosing which part of myself to bring forward."}
