The law was always evolving, and I prided myself on staying current, ensuring justice was served with the most up-to-date understanding.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Ahmed, a gentle soul from the mosque. \u201cImam, if you have a moment, I\u2019d appreciate your advice about something personal.\u201d I remembered his hesitant tone after prayers, the way he lingered, hoping for guidance. As an imam, I was expected to be present, to offer counsel and comfort whenever my community needed me.\n\nI stared at the legal document, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. The law demanded my focus, but so did my faith and my people. My heart tugged in two directions, each expectation urgent, each role a part of who I am."}
