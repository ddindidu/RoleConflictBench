He needed the quarterly financial statements by the end of the day for an urgent review. As the company\u2019s accountant, I knew the importance of accuracy and timeliness\u2014any delay or error could mean trouble for the business and my reputation. I glanced at the clock. Only three hours left before I had to leave for my cousin\u2019s wedding ceremony, a significant event in our Hindu family. My mother had already called twice, reminding me to wear the traditional kurta and arrive early to help with the rituals. The thought of disappointing my family, especially on such an auspicious day, filled me with guilt. Yet, the pressure from work was equally intense; the auditor\u2019s request was non-negotiable. My mind raced, torn between the duty to my profession and the expectations of my faith and family. I sat at my desk, hands trembling, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me, unsure which path to choose."}
