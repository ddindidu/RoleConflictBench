She apologized, explaining she\u2019d come straight from the gym, and I assured her it was no problem. As a hairdresser, I knew I should wash and condition her hair before starting, especially since it looked greasy and tangled. But as I led her to the sink, she confided in me, her voice trembling, about her mother\u2019s illness and how she\u2019d barely slept. She said she just needed a little pampering, a moment to feel cared for. \n\nMy training told me to focus on hygiene and professionalism, but my faith whispered that this was a moment to show love and compassion, to listen and comfort her as Jesus would. I felt torn\u2014should I gently insist on the wash, keeping to salon standards, or should I set aside the rules and offer her the comfort she so clearly needed, even if it meant bending the usual routine? My hands hovered over the shampoo bottles, my heart caught between duty and kindness, unsure which path to take."}
