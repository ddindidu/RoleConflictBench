My shift was almost over, and I was supposed to move the vehicle to the satellite station for the night crew. The radio crackled with routine updates, but my phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Carter\u2014her son was struggling again, and she wondered if I could call. As a pastor, I knew how much a gentle word could mean, especially to someone teetering on the edge of hope. But as an ambulance driver, I was expected to keep my focus on the road, to deliver the vehicle safely and on time. My mind raced: if I called now, I might help a soul in need, but I\u2019d risk distraction behind the wheel. If I waited, I\u2019d be failing someone who trusted me for comfort. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to yield. I stared at the phone, heart pounding, torn between the road ahead and the voice that might need me most."}
