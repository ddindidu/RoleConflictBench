Product had just sent out an invite for a general brainstorming session next sprint\u2014attendance was optional, but I knew these sessions were where new features were born, where my input could shape the product\u2019s future. I wanted to be there, to collaborate, to prove I was a team player.\n\nThen, a gentle ping: an email from Mary, a parishioner. She wondered if we could chat sometime soon, nothing urgent, just a need for guidance. I could almost hear the uncertainty in her words, the hope that I\u2019d make time for her. As a priest, I was called to be present, to listen, to offer comfort whenever it was needed.\n\nI felt the tension coil in my chest. If I said yes to Mary, I might miss the brainstorming session and risk being seen as less committed at work. If I prioritized the session, I\u2019d be putting my parishioner\u2019s needs second, betraying the trust my congregation placed in me. The expectations from both worlds pressed in, and I sat frozen, unable to choose, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
