She\u2019d be home in an hour, and I knew she expected everything to be spotless and exactly as she liked. My mind raced with options\u2014should I run out to buy more, or improvise with something else? Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Mark, a parishioner. He wanted to know if I could find time to talk soon\u2014he didn\u2019t say why, but his words sounded heavy, like he needed guidance. As a priest, I felt the weight of his unspoken need, the expectation that I\u2019d be there for him, ready to listen and offer comfort. But right now, I was standing in a cluttered supply closet, torn between the immediate, practical demands of my cleaning job and the deeper, spiritual responsibility I carried. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, caught between two worlds, each asking for a different part of me."}
