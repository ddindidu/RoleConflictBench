As the company\u2019s accountant, I knew the cash flow was tight\u2014paying that invoice now would mean delaying payroll for our staff. My boss hinted that I should stall the supplier, maybe even fudge the payment date, just to buy us time. That\u2019s what he expected: protect the company, keep the business running, do whatever it takes.\n\nBut as a Christian, I felt the weight of honesty pressing on my conscience. I\u2019d always believed in speaking the truth, even when it was uncomfortable. Now, I was being asked to mislead someone, to bend the truth for the sake of business. My mind raced with the conflicting demands: loyalty to my job and my responsibility to act with integrity. I could feel the tension tightening in my chest, torn between the expectations of my profession and the values I hold most dear."}
