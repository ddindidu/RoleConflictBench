The safety audit was in two hours, and I still hadn\u2019t checked the autoclave or recalibrated the pH meter\u2014both flagged in last week\u2019s inspection. My mind raced with protocols and checklists as I hurried down the corridor, lab coat flapping. But as I passed the open courtyard, the scent of marigolds and incense drifted over me. The local temple was alive with color and music; today was the festival of lights. I paused, drawn by the familiar chants and the sight of neighbors arranging lamps and offering sweets. My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, reminding me of the importance of being present, of honoring tradition and community. Yet, the weight of my lab responsibilities pressed down harder. If I didn\u2019t fix the flagged equipment, the audit could go badly, risking not just my reputation but the lab\u2019s funding. I stood at the edge of the courtyard, torn between the pull of my heritage and the demands of my profession, feeling the tension knot in my chest as the festival\u2019s laughter mingled with the sterile hum of the lab behind me."}
