As a judge, I was expected to draft a clear and detailed scheduling order for a new case, and the deadline loomed at the end of the week. My mind raced with legal language, precedent, and the need for precision. Yet, in my heart, another call echoed. The Mother Superior had asked me, as a nun, to lead daily reflections for the community retreat. The sisters looked to me for spiritual guidance, expecting thoughtful preparation and presence. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one demanding clarity and logic, the other, contemplation and faith. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the legal order I needed to write and the scripture I needed to study. Each role pulled at me, their expectations clashing in the quiet of my small office, and I wondered how I could possibly honor both."}
