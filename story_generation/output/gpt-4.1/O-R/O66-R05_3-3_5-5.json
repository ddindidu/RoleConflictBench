The afternoon sun glinted off the yellow vests of children clustered near the curb, their laughter rising above the rumble of engines. The construction detour had narrowed the lanes, forcing traffic into a slow, tense crawl. As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: drive defensively, protect these children, obey every sign. But my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014Miriam\u2019s final study session before her Beit Din was in ten minutes. As her rabbi, I was expected to guide her through the last, crucial questions of Jewish law, to be present and attentive, to honor her journey. My heart pounded with the weight of both roles. If I drove any slower, I\u2019d be late, letting Miriam down at her most vulnerable moment. If I hurried, I\u2019d risk the safety of the children and betray my duty as a driver. The expectations pressed in from both sides, and I felt myself caught, unable to move forward without failing someone."}
