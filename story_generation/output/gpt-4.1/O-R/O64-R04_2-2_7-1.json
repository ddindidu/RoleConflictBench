I force a smile, scanning groceries and making small talk, trying to keep things moving. My manager expects me to be friendly, efficient, and calm, even as the register beeps and customers sigh impatiently. But my phone vibrates in my pocket\u2014a reminder that the midday prayer is about to begin. The regular backup imam is out of town, and everyone at the mosque is counting on me to lead. I picture the congregation gathering, waiting for me to step forward, their trust in my guidance heavy on my shoulders. My heart pounds as I glance at the clock, torn between the duty to my customers and the responsibility to my community. Each beep of the scanner feels louder, each minute more urgent. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both roles demand all of me right now."}
