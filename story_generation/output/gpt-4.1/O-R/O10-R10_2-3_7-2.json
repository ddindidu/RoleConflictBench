They were confused about a line item on their latest invoice and wanted clarification immediately. As an accountant, I knew I had to respond quickly and professionally, maintaining our reputation for prompt, clear communication. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart sank. It was almost time for my midday puja, a ritual I never missed. My family and my own beliefs expected me to pause everything, wash up, light the lamp, chant, and offer flowers\u2014each step sacred, not to be rushed or skipped. The incense and the mantras were my anchor, but so was my commitment to my clients. I stared at the email, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between the duty to my faith and the responsibility to my work, knowing that whichever I chose, something important would be left waiting."}
