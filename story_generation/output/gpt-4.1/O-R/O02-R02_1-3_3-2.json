The routine safety audit at the plant was still weeks away, but my manager had just sent a message: \u201cLet\u2019s get all documentation updated by tomorrow for a surprise internal review.\u201d I knew the expectation\u2014no shortcuts, no errors. As the lead engineer, I was responsible for every line in those reports, every signature, every compliance box checked. \n\nBut tomorrow was also the most significant religious holiday of the year. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, deliver the sermon, and guide the rituals. People had been preparing for weeks, and many would travel from distant towns just to attend. My absence would be noticed, and it would hurt them. \n\nI felt the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My phone buzzed with reminders from the plant, while messages from parishioners filled my inbox with prayers and hopes for tomorrow\u2019s service. I sat at my desk, torn between duty and devotion, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
