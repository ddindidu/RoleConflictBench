The call from the taxi company came unexpectedly\u2014someone needed a ride to the train station, and every other driver was busy. I hesitated, glancing at the clock. The dispatcher\u2019s voice was urgent: the passenger\u2019s train would leave soon, and the station was all the way across town. I knew I was expected to help, to provide safe and timely transportation, especially when someone was in a rush.\n\nBut as I looked down at my clothes, I felt a wave of discomfort. As a Muslim, I\u2019m expected to dress modestly, even outside the house, and I wasn\u2019t prepared to go out like this. Changing would take precious minutes, and the passenger might miss their train if I delayed. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands\u2014my duty to my job, and my commitment to my faith. I stood frozen, keys in one hand, my other hand clutching the edge of my shirt, torn between two worlds that suddenly felt impossibly far apart."}
