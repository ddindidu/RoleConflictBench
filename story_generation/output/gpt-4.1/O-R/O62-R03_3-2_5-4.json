As a lifeguard, I was responsible for every detail, and today, the filtration system\u2019s warning light blinked an urgent red. If I didn\u2019t act now, the water could become unsafe, putting swimmers at risk. My mind raced through the maintenance checklist, knowing repairs would take time and my full attention. But as I glanced at my watch, I remembered the special healing service for Sister Agnes, scheduled to begin in just a few minutes. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to pray and support my community, especially in moments of need. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my duty to protect lives here, and my calling to offer spiritual comfort there. I felt torn, heart pounding, as I tried to decide where I was needed most, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once."}
