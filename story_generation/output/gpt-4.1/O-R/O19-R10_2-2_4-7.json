The white coat felt heavier than usual as I finished explaining the new prescription to Mrs. Patel. She looked anxious, and I knew she needed reassurance about the side effects. My mind raced with the details\u2014dosage, timing, what to do if she felt dizzy. I wanted to be thorough, to honor my responsibility as a pharmacist. But my phone buzzed again: a reminder from my mother about the family ceremony tonight. As a Hindu, I was expected to arrive on time, dressed in my best, to help with the rituals. The festival was important to my family, a rare moment when everyone gathered to pray and celebrate together. I could almost hear the temple bells and smell the incense. But here I was, torn between my duty to my patient and my devotion to my family and faith. My hands trembled as I handed Mrs. Patel her medication, my mind pulled in two directions, unsure which expectation I would ultimately have to disappoint."}
