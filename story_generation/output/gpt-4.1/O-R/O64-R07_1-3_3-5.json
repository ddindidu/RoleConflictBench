Store policy was clear: every cent must be accounted for, no matter how minor. My manager expected me to report even the smallest errors, and I prided myself on being a reliable cashier. But as I stared at the numbers, my mind drifted to the meditation group waiting for me. I was supposed to lead the session in less than ten minutes, guiding everyone in mindfulness and calm. The thought of being late, or distracted by work stress, felt like a betrayal of my Buddhist practice. I could already feel my breath growing shallow, my thoughts racing between the duty to my job and the responsibility to my sangha. If I took the time to investigate and report the discrepancy, I\u2019d miss the start of meditation. If I left it, I\u2019d be ignoring my commitment to honesty and diligence. My hands trembled slightly as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, caught between the ringing of the register and the quiet I was supposed to embody."}
