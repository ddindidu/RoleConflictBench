She smiled apologetically, mentioning she\u2019d rushed over straight from her workout. As a hairdresser, I knew what was expected: wash and condition her hair thoroughly before starting the cut. It was part of my job, a basic courtesy and necessity for good results. I led her to the sink, but my mind wandered.\n\nTonight was supposed to be different. For once, I had a quiet evening ahead\u2014no family gatherings, no errands, just time for myself. I\u2019d planned to recite and reflect on the Quran, something I\u2019d been neglecting lately. The thought of finally reconnecting with my faith filled me with anticipation and guilt at how often I\u2019d let work take over.\n\nNow, as I massaged shampoo into her scalp, I felt the tension rising. If I took my time and did my job well, I\u2019d be late getting home, and my precious window for spiritual reflection would shrink. But if I rushed, I\u2019d be letting down my client and my professional standards. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I wondered which expectation I would have to disappoint tonight."}
