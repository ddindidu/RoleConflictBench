The school zone sign flashed, and children clustered on the curb, their laughter piercing the morning air. As a taxi driver, I knew the rules\u2014slow down, stay alert, protect these little lives. But my phone buzzed on the seat beside me, a message from Sister Agnes: the family next door had lost everything in a fire last night. They needed help now\u2014food, clothing, comfort. My heart ached, torn between my duty to the children outside and my calling as a nun to serve those in crisis. If I stopped to help the family, I\u2019d be late for my next fare, risking my job and the safety of my passengers. If I focused only on the road, I\u2019d be ignoring the desperate plea for compassion that defined my faith. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between the rules of the road and the call to serve."}
