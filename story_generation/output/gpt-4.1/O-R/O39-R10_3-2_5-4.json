My supervisor always drilled into us: safety first, never let anyone risk their life for a shortcut. I opened my mouth to shout, but just then, I overheard the foreman berating another worker, Suresh, for a mistake he didn\u2019t make. Suresh looked crushed, and I knew he was innocent. As a Hindu, I\u2019m taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, to protect others from injustice. My heart pounded\u2014should I yell to save Ramesh from danger, or should I step in and defend Suresh from the unfair scolding? Both needed me, but I couldn\u2019t do both at once. My throat tightened, torn between my duty to keep the site safe and my responsibility to uphold dharma. The seconds stretched, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down, demanding action."}
