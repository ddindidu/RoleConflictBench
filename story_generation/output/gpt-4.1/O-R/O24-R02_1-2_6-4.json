As a judge, I know I must stay current, for the law is a living thing, and my rulings must reflect its most recent growth. Yet, as I reach for the journal, my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder of my appointment with Mrs. Callahan, a parishioner who has been struggling with grief since her husband\u2019s passing. As her priest, I am expected to offer her comfort, to listen and guide her through her pain. The weight of both roles presses on me: the law demands my intellect, the church my compassion. I glance at the clock, torn between the silent call of the journal and the very real, human need waiting for me in the next room. My mind races, heart heavy, as I wrestle with the impossible choice between duty to the law and duty to the soul."}
