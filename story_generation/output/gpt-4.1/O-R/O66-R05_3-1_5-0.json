The construction cones forced me closer to the curb, where a group of children waited, backpacks swinging, their laughter rising above the hum of engines. As a taxi driver, I knew the rules: slow down, stay alert, protect the kids at all costs. But my mind kept drifting to my other life\u2014the rabbi\u2019s life\u2014where I was expected to inspire, to guide, to prepare a sermon that would touch hearts in just a few weeks. Ideas for the sermon pressed at the edges of my thoughts, demanding attention, but the road demanded more. I felt the weight of both roles: the responsibility to keep these children safe, and the pressure to be spiritually present for my congregation. My heart pounded with the strain of trying to be both protector and teacher, knowing that in this moment, I could not fully be either."}
