The weekly group meditation is about to begin, and I promised myself I\u2019d attend\u2014just one hour to breathe, to be present, to practice the mindfulness that keeps me grounded. But as I gather my things, my assistant knocks, her face anxious. She asks for access to sensitive client files, explaining it would make her work much easier. I know she means well, but she\u2019s not familiar with the case, and the rules are clear: confidentiality is paramount. My mind races. As a lawyer, I must protect my client\u2019s trust, uphold the ethical standards that define my profession. But as a Buddhist, I strive to be compassionate, to help others, to avoid causing frustration or disappointment. The pressure mounts inside me\u2014should I risk being late to meditation, or risk betraying a client\u2019s trust? My breath catches, torn between the demands of my profession and the peace I seek in my practice."}
