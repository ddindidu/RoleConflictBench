They looked exhausted, grateful, and asked if I could help load their bags and if they could split the fare. As a taxi driver, I knew what was expected: be helpful, courteous, and get them to their destination efficiently. I started to get out of the car, but my phone buzzed. It was a message from the synagogue\u2014someone in the community had passed away, and they needed exactly one more person to make the minyan for the funeral prayer. Without me, the prayer couldn\u2019t happen. My heart pounded. I looked at the travelers, their hopeful faces, and then at the message, feeling the weight of my responsibility as a Jew. I was torn between my duty to my passengers and my obligation to my faith and community. The seconds stretched, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice between delivering professional service and honoring a sacred tradition."}
