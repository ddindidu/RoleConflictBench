As a nursing assistant, I knew how much she depended on me for her bath and breakfast, especially since her arthritis had flared up again. The hospital was short-staffed today, and I could already hear the call bells ringing from other rooms. My supervisor expected me to be quick and efficient, but I also wanted to give each patient the care and attention they deserved.\n\nAs I entered Mrs. Evans\u2019 room, my phone buzzed with a reminder: Sunday worship at church was starting soon. I hadn\u2019t been able to attend in weeks, and I missed the sense of peace and community it brought me. My faith was important, and I felt a responsibility to be present, to worship, and to support my church family. But here I was, needed just as much in this hospital, with patients relying on me for their most basic needs.\n\nI stood at the foot of Mrs. Evans\u2019 bed, torn between my duty to my patients and my longing to be at church, wrestling with the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
