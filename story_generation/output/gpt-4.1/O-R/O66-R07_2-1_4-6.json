Cars darted in and out of lanes, their impatience making every intersection a gamble. As a taxi driver, I knew I had to stay alert, follow every traffic law, and anticipate the next unpredictable move. My phone buzzed with a message from Tenzin, my old friend from the temple. \u201cCan we talk about the sermon from yesterday? I need your thoughts.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift was far from over, and the roads demanded my full attention. Yet, as a Buddhist, I felt the pull to pause, reflect, and offer guidance, to be present for a friend seeking spiritual clarity. The tension twisted inside me: the world outside required vigilance and quick reflexes, while my heart yearned for the calm of mindful conversation. I gripped the wheel, torn between the demands of the road and the call to spiritual reflection, uncertain which path to choose."}
