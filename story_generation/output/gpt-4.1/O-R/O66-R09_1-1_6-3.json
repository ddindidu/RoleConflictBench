My next passenger slid into the back seat, clutching a greasy bag of fast food. The smell of cheeseburgers and fries filled the cab, and I felt a pang of hunger. As a taxi driver, I\u2019m expected to keep my car clean and make passengers comfortable, so I forced a smile and handed him some napkins, even though I knew the crumbs would be everywhere. But as a Jew, I\u2019m careful to keep kosher, and the thought of non-kosher food spilling onto my seat or mixing with my own snacks in the glove compartment made me uneasy. I glanced at the kosher granola bar I\u2019d packed, suddenly less appetizing. Should I ask him not to eat, risking a bad review and breaking the unspoken rule of hospitality? Or do I let him eat, knowing I\u2019ll have to scrub the cab and maybe even feel like I\u2019ve compromised my own standards? My hands tightened on the wheel as I wrestled with what to do next."}
