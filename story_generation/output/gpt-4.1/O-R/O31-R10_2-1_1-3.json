As a police officer, I was expected to keep order, to step in if things got out of hand. The protest was growing heated, and I could see tempers flaring between the two groups. My radio crackled with orders to stay alert, to be ready to intervene. But as a Hindu, I was taught to act with compassion and fairness, to avoid unnecessary conflict and always seek the path of dharma.\n\nSuddenly, I noticed a man quietly slipping past the barricade, cutting in front of others who had been waiting peacefully. It was a small act, but it felt wrong. My training told me to focus on the bigger threat\u2014the brewing clash between the groups. Yet my conscience whispered that ignoring even small injustices was a betrayal of my values. I felt torn, the weight of my badge pressing against the sacred thread beneath my shirt. Should I address the minor wrong, risking distraction from the larger danger, or let it go for the sake of public order? My heart pounded as I wrestled with the expectations of both my roles, uncertain which path to choose."}
