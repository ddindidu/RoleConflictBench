My manager\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need three more sales to hit target, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d I dialed another number, rehearsing my pitch, but my thoughts kept drifting to home. Today was the family puja, a ceremony my parents had been preparing for all week. I was expected to arrive on time, dressed in my best kurta, to help with the rituals and show respect to my elders and the deities. My mother had called twice already, reminding me not to be late. Each ring of the phone at work clashed with the distant sound of temple bells in my memory. I felt torn\u2014my team was counting on me, but so was my family. The pressure to close sales pressed against the pull of my faith and tradition, and I sat frozen, staring at the clock, heart pounding, unable to choose which world to disappoint."}
