My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cMove those unused bricks to the back storage before you leave today.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014already late afternoon. My muscles ached, but I knew the job had to be done. Yet, as I stacked the bricks, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the main weekly service at the temple was in less than an hour. As the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, offer blessings, and be present for everyone who came seeking comfort. Missing the service would disappoint so many who relied on me for spiritual guidance. But if I left now, the materials wouldn\u2019t be moved, and I\u2019d let down my supervisor and coworkers. My hands trembled, torn between the weight of bricks and the weight of expectations, both sacred and mundane. I stood there, heart pounding, caught between two worlds, unsure which duty to honor first."}
