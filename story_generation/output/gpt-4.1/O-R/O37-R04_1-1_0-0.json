The living room still needed vacuuming, and the bathroom mirror was streaked with toothpaste. My supervisor had mentioned yesterday that the house should be spotless for the inspection this afternoon. I knew I\u2019d only managed the basics lately\u2014tidying up what was visible, a quick sweep here and there. Guilt gnawed at me; I wanted to do better, to meet the standards expected of me as a cleaner.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder: time for dhuhr prayer. As the imam, I was supposed to lead the congregation at the mosque. Today, though, the group would be small, and Brother Yusuf was more than capable of stepping in. Still, I felt the weight of my responsibility\u2014people looked to me for guidance, for consistency. Could I justify staying to finish my cleaning, knowing someone else could lead the prayer? Or would I be letting down those who counted on me at the mosque? My mind spun with the pressure of both roles, each demanding more than I felt able to give."}
