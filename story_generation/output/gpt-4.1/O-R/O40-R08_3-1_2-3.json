As a Muslim, I always make sure to dress modestly, even when I\u2019m just lounging around the house. Today, I wore a loose, comfortable tunic and long pants, perfect for relaxing with my wife and kids. But just as I settled in, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from the site manager. There was an urgent need to inspect and maintain some tools before tomorrow\u2019s big project. As a carpenter, I know how crucial it is to follow safety protocols, especially before starting structural work. I needed to head to the site immediately, but my modest home clothes weren\u2019t suitable for the dusty, hazardous environment. The safety gear\u2014heavy boots, fitted overalls, and a short-sleeved shirt\u2014was waiting in my locker at work, but changing into it would mean compromising my usual standards of modesty. I stood in the hallway, torn between my responsibility to keep the site safe and my commitment to my faith, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
