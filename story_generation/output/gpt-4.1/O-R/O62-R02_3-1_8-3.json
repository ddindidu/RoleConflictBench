As a lifeguard, I was expected to enforce every safety rule, no exceptions. Suddenly, I spotted a child flailing in the deep end\u2014a restricted area. My heart pounded; I knew I had to act fast, to keep everyone safe. Just as I prepared to dive in, Mrs. Callahan, a parishioner from my church, approached the stand. \u201cFather, could we talk sometime soon? I\u2019ve been struggling,\u201d she said, her voice trembling with hope and vulnerability. As a priest, I was called to offer comfort and guidance, to be present for those in need. But right now, my attention was split\u2014one role demanded immediate action, the other required compassion and presence. I felt the weight of both uniforms pressing on my shoulders, torn between the urgent need in the water and the quiet plea at my side. My mind raced, caught between the whistle and the collar, knowing I could not fully serve both at once."}
