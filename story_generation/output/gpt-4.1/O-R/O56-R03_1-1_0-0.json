The receptionist was chatting idly, so I hurried over, ready to greet her and offer tea, as I always did. Making clients feel welcome was part of my job, and I took pride in it. But as I reached for the kettle, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the monthly food drive at the convent was starting in fifteen minutes. As a nun, I was expected to be there, helping to serve meals and offer comfort to those in need. My heart twisted. I could see Mrs. Alvarez settling into her chair, expecting the usual friendly conversation and care. At the same time, I pictured my sisters at the shelter, counting on my presence and hands. The weight of both worlds pressed on me, each demanding my time, my compassion, my presence. I stood frozen, torn between the salon\u2019s gentle hum and the distant call of service, unsure which part of myself to honor first."}
