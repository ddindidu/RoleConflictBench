My manager expects speed and accuracy, especially during this evening rush. I glance at the clock\u2014almost six. Tonight, my community gathers for our Quran study circle, and I\u2019m supposed to have read and reflected on the assigned verses. But I haven\u2019t had a moment to open the Quran all week. My mind races: if I rush, I might finish my shift in time, but I\u2019ll be exhausted, my thoughts scattered. If I slow down to avoid mistakes, I\u2019ll be late, and the group will know I\u2019m unprepared. I feel the weight of my manager\u2019s expectations pressing on one side, and the quiet, persistent call of my faith on the other. My hands move automatically, but my heart is torn, caught between the demands of my job and the responsibilities of my faith, unsure which to honor as the minutes slip away."}
