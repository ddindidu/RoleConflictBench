My phone buzzed with another message from the passenger: \u201cAre you close? I really need to get to the hospital fast.\u201d I gripped the steering wheel, feeling the weight of my uniform beneath my coat\u2014a habit hidden from view, but never from my conscience. As a taxi driver, I owed my passenger punctuality and calm, a professional who could be relied upon in moments of urgency. But as a nun, the bells of the convent were already ringing in my mind, calling me to prayer, to the sacred rhythm of our daily service. I could almost hear the sisters\u2019 voices rising in the chapel, a harmony I was expected to join, a commitment I had made to God and my community. My heart pounded with the pressure of both worlds\u2014one demanding my presence on the road, the other in the pew. I stared at the intersection ahead, torn between the urgent needs of a stranger and the vows that shaped my life, knowing I could not be in two places at once."}
