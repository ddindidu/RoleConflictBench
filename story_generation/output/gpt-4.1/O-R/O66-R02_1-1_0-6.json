The passenger slid into the back seat, mentioning he was just heading to a coffee shop for a casual meeting, no rush. I nodded, but my mind was elsewhere. In less than an hour, I was supposed to be at the parish hall, leading the first planning meeting for our adult faith formation series. As a priest, I knew how much the community depended on me to organize these classes, to guide their spiritual growth. But as a taxi driver, I owed my passenger a safe, comfortable ride, and the courtesy of not making him feel hurried or unimportant. My phone buzzed with a reminder about the meeting, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. Should I take the quickest route, risking making the passenger feel rushed, or stick to my usual, more scenic drive and risk being late to the meeting? The weight of both collars\u2014one white, one yellow\u2014pressed on me as I gripped the steering wheel, torn between two worlds."}
