They looked exhausted, and as I stepped out to help load their bags, they explained they wanted to split the fare. I nodded, already calculating the best route and how to handle the payment professionally. Just as I finished stacking the last suitcase, my phone buzzed\u2014a message from a young couple I\u2019d met at synagogue. They wanted to know if I could officiate their wedding next year, and they needed an answer soon to finalize their plans. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be a reliable, courteous driver in this moment, and the responsibility to guide and support my community as their rabbi. My mind raced, torn between the immediate needs of my passengers and the long-term commitment the couple was asking of me. I stood there, keys in hand, heart pounding, caught between two lives that rarely collided so directly."}
