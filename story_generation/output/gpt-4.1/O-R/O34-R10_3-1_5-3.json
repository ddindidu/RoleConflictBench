Every second counted. As an air traffic controller, I knew my duty\u2014clear, precise instructions could mean the difference between safety and disaster. But just then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a colleague quietly slip ahead in the break queue, bypassing someone who\u2019d been waiting. It was a small thing, but my upbringing as a Hindu pressed on my conscience\u2014dharma, the call to fairness and righteousness, even in the smallest acts. I felt the weight of both roles: the pilot\u2019s life in my hands, the subtle injustice before my eyes. My mind raced, torn between the immediate, life-or-death responsibility and the quiet, persistent voice urging me to uphold ethical conduct. The tension twisted inside me, each role demanding my attention, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
