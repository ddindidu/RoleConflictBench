My mind was sharp, focused on the high-value transactions I needed to process without error. Each bill, each coin, each receipt had to be perfect\u2014any mistake could mean trouble for the store and for me. As I handed change to a customer, I noticed a man quietly slipping ahead in the line, bypassing a tired woman who had been waiting patiently. My heart tightened. As a Hindu, I was taught to uphold dharma, to act with fairness and integrity, even in small matters. But as a cashier, my main duty was to keep the line moving, avoid confrontation, and ensure the register balanced at the end of my shift. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014should I speak up and risk slowing things down, or stay silent and let the unfairness pass? The expectation to do what was right clashed with the demand to do my job efficiently, and I stood there, torn, the next customer already stepping forward."}
