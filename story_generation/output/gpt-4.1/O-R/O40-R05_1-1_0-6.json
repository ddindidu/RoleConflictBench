As a carpenter, punctuality is non-negotiable\u2014if I\u2019m late, the crew waits, and the day\u2019s safety briefing is delayed. My foreman expects me to set an example, double-checking harnesses and reminding the younger guys to keep their goggles on. But as I was pulling on my work boots, my phone buzzed. It was an email from a young couple, asking if I could officiate their wedding next summer. They wanted to meet today, before they made a final decision. As their rabbi, I know how important it is to be present, to listen, to help them feel seen and supported at the start of their journey together. But if I leave the site, I let my crew down and risk their safety. If I stay, I might lose the chance to guide this couple through a sacred moment. My heart pounds as I stare at my phone, torn between two worlds that both need me, both right now."}
