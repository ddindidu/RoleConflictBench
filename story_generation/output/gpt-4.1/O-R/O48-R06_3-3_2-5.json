It was nearly time for the Sunday service, and I knew my church family would be expecting me. I\u2019d promised to help set up for the potluck, and Pastor John had asked me to lead the opening prayer. But as I turned to leave, I saw Mrs. Evans, one of my patients, struggling to lift her spoon. Her face was twisted in pain, and she looked at me with pleading eyes. As a nursing assistant, I knew I couldn\u2019t just walk away. She needed help eating, and I was the only one available. Yet, the thought of disappointing my church, of not fulfilling my commitment to worship and serve, gnawed at me. I felt torn between my duty to care for Mrs. Evans and my responsibility to my faith community. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, wrestling with what to do next."}
