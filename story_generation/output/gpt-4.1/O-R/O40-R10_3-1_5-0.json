Tonight, I sit at my workbench, blueprints spread out before me, trying to make sense of the technical drawings and measurements. My mind keeps drifting, though, because as a practicing Hindu, I know I should be performing my evening puja right now\u2014lighting the lamp, offering flowers, and chanting the full set of prayers. Instead, I quietly repeat a short mantra under my breath, hoping it\u2019s enough. The sawdust on my hands feels out of place as I touch my prayer beads. My family expects me to uphold our traditions, especially during important times, but the pressure to get every detail right for tomorrow\u2019s project weighs heavily on me. I feel torn, caught between the demands of my craft and the quiet pull of my faith, unsure which part of myself to honor tonight."}
