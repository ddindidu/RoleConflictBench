She depended on this precise combination of medications to manage her heart and diabetes. My mind raced through the dosages, interactions, and her history\u2014there was no room for error. Just as I was about to finish, my phone buzzed. It was the synagogue\u2019s education director: the children were gathering for their weekly Torah class, and I was expected to lead them in study and song. I glanced at the clock. If I left now, I\u2019d barely make it in time, but Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s prescription wasn\u2019t ready. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my duty to safeguard health, and my calling to guide young souls in faith.
