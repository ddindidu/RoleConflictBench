A quick check confirmed my suspicion\u2014the filtration system was malfunctioning. As a lifeguard, I knew this was serious. Swimmers\u2019 safety depended on clean water, and I needed to act fast, maybe even close the pool until repairs were made. Just as I was about to call maintenance, my phone buzzed. It was Ahmed, a community member from the mosque. He sounded hesitant but said he\u2019d been struggling with something personal and hoped I could offer some guidance, \u201cwhenever you have a moment.\u201d I could hear the weight in his voice. As an imam, I\u2019m expected to be there for my community, to listen and provide comfort, especially when someone reaches out. But right now, the pool was filling up with kids, and the faulty filter was a ticking time bomb. My mind raced, torn between my duty to protect lives at the pool and my responsibility to support someone in spiritual need. Both roles demanded my immediate attention, and I felt the pressure mounting, unsure which call to answer first."}
