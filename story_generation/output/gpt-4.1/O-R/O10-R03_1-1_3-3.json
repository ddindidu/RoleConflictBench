My supervisor at the firm had sent an urgent email: a seminar on upcoming tax law changes was being held this morning, and attendance was strongly encouraged for all accountants. I knew how important it was to stay ahead of regulations, to ensure our clients remained compliant and our firm\u2019s reputation untarnished. Yet, as the clock struck eight, the convent bell tolled, calling all sisters to the main chapel for our daily morning prayer. As a nun, I was expected to be present, to join my sisters in devotion and uphold the sacred rhythm of our communal life. My heart pounded as I stared at the seminar link on my screen, the echo of the bell lingering in my ears. I felt torn, the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders\u2014one demanding my professional diligence, the other my spiritual fidelity. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice, the expectations of both my callings pulling me in opposite directions."}
