The client in front of me was furious, her voice echoing through the nearly empty salon. She jabbed a finger at her reflection, demanding I fix the cut, her words sharp and impatient. My manager\u2019s eyes flicked over, silently urging me to handle it with grace, to keep the client happy no matter how late it got. I felt the weight of expectation pressing down\u2014professionalism, patience, the unspoken rule that the client is always right.\n\nBut as I listened, my mind drifted to something deeper. I thought of my parents\u2019 voices on the phone last night, gently reminding me of the importance of Hajj, of fulfilling my duty as a Muslim. I wanted to go, to stand among millions in Mecca, but my earnings barely covered rent, let alone a pilgrimage. The salon was my chance to save, but every extra hour spent here felt like a step further from my spiritual goal. I felt torn, caught between the demands of my job and the longing in my heart, unsure which voice to answer first."}
