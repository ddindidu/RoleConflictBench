They need a ruling within the hour.\u201d I nodded, already feeling the familiar pressure of the bench. I knew what was expected: to read every page, consider every argument, and ensure justice was served\u2014swiftly, but never carelessly.\n\nJust as I opened the file, my phone buzzed. It was a message from a parishioner, someone I\u2019d seen in the pews every Sunday. \u201cFather, could we talk sometime? I could use some guidance.\u201d The words were simple, but I sensed the quiet urgency behind them. As a priest, I was called to listen, to offer comfort, to be present for those in need, no matter how small the request seemed.\n\nI stared at the legal documents, then at the message. Both roles demanded my full attention, but in such different ways. The law required my mind; the church, my heart. I felt torn, knowing that whichever I chose to address first, I would be letting someone down."}
