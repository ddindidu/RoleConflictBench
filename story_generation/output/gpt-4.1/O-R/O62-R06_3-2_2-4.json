As a lifeguard, I knew the dangers of high tide\u2014how quickly a strong current could pull someone under. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cNo distractions. Every second counts.\u201d But today was Sunday, and as a Christian, I was expected at church, to worship and join the community in prayer. My pastor had gently reminded me last week how important it was to be present, not just in spirit but in body, too. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing on me. If I left my post, even for a short while, I\u2019d risk the safety of everyone in the water. But if I stayed, I\u2019d miss the service, and with it, the sense of belonging and spiritual renewal I craved. My heart pounded as I watched the waves, torn between my duty to protect and my longing to worship, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
