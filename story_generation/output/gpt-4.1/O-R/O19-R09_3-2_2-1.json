The dosage was precise, the margin for error nonexistent. My mind replayed the pharmacist\u2019s oath\u2014accuracy, safety, the patient\u2019s life in my hands. Yet, as I counted the pills, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the holiday was just days away. My children still didn\u2019t know the blessings, the melodies, the stories that make this time sacred. I was supposed to teach them, to pass on the traditions my parents gave me. But the pharmacy was short-staffed, and I was needed for every shift. My supervisor expected perfection, no distractions. My family expected devotion, no excuses. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding more than I felt I could give. I stared at the prescription, my heart pounding, torn between the life in my hands and the legacy in my heart, unsure which responsibility I would have to let down."}
