Dispatch had called in a patient with a fractured arm\u2014painful, but not life-threatening. My training as an ambulance driver echoed in my mind: safety first, no matter the urgency. Yet, every red light and impatient honk pressed on my nerves, the expectation to deliver swift help clashing with the duty to keep everyone safe.\n\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket, a message from Brother Yusuf, a congregant who had been struggling with family turmoil. He pleaded for a meeting today, his words heavy with desperation. As an imam, I knew the weight of his trust, the expectation to offer comfort and guidance when his spirit was most fragile. But here I was, trapped in a sea of cars, responsible for a patient and the lives around me.\n\nThe demands of both roles pulled at me\u2014one urging me to hurry, the other to be present for someone in need. My heart pounded with the pressure, torn between the road ahead and the call for spiritual support, uncertain which duty should come first."}
