My client expects everything spotless, and I\u2019m responsible for making sure supplies never run out. The next cleaning is in three days, and if I don\u2019t get more cleaner before then, I\u2019ll be letting them down. I checked the time\u2014just an hour before my weekly group meditation. As a Buddhist, I value this time deeply; it\u2019s my chance to practice mindfulness, to reconnect with my breath and let go of daily worries. But the store is across town, and if I go now, I\u2019ll miss the meditation. If I wait until after, the store will be closed. My mind buzzes with anxiety, torn between my duty to my client and my commitment to my spiritual practice. I feel the weight of both expectations pressing on me, each important in its own way, and I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, heart racing, unable to move."}
