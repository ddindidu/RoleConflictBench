The project timeline was tight, but I\u2019d been reviewing tasks with a casual eye, trusting my team to keep things moving. Still, a nagging worry crept in\u2014deadlines loomed, and I was expected to manage every detail efficiently. My phone buzzed with a reminder: it was time for my daily Quran reading. Ramadan was halfway through, and I was already behind on my reading quota. The expectation to recite and reflect weighed heavily on me, especially now, when every moment felt precious. I stared at the open blueprint, my mind drifting to the verses I hadn\u2019t yet read. Guilt pressed in from both sides\u2014my faith urging me to pause and reconnect, my profession demanding focus and control. I closed my eyes, feeling the tension coil in my chest, torn between the demands of my work and the spiritual nourishment I craved."}
