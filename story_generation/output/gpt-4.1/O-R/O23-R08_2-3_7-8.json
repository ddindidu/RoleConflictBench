As a lawyer, I knew the rules\u2014client confidentiality was sacred, and I could not allow anyone, not even a well-meaning assistant, to access files they had no business seeing. Yet, she stood at my door, pleading for access, explaining how it would save time and help the team. I could see her frustration, but my duty was clear.\n\nAt the same time, my heart ached with another responsibility. My doctor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cIf you want to perform Hajj, this year may be your last chance.\u201d As a Muslim, the pilgrimage was not just a dream but a religious obligation, one I had longed for since childhood. But leaving now, with the office in turmoil and sensitive cases unresolved, felt like abandoning my post.\n\nI stared at the files, torn between the trust my clients placed in me and the call of my faith. The expectations from both sides clashed within me, leaving me restless, uncertain, and painfully aware that any choice would mean letting someone down."}
