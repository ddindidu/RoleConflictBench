The cab was spotless, just as I prided myself\u2014no crumbs on the seats, the faint scent of lemon cleaner in the air. My next fare was already waiting, and I knew I had to keep up my reputation for professionalism. But as I drove, my mind kept drifting to the sermon I hadn\u2019t finished. Shabbat was only a few hours away, and my congregation would expect words of wisdom, comfort, and guidance. I could almost hear Mrs. Goldstein\u2019s gentle reminder: \u201cRabbi, your messages always help us start the week right.\u201d Yet here I was, circling city blocks, picking up fares, and watching the minutes slip away. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cPrepare sermon for Shabbat.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting\u2014should I pull over and jot down ideas, risking a late pickup and a dissatisfied customer? Or keep driving, knowing my sermon would be rushed and unworthy of my calling? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding more than I felt I could give."}
