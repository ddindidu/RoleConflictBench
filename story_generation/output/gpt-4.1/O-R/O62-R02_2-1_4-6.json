Swim lessons would start in less than an hour, and if I didn\u2019t fix it, the kids would be left without proper lanes, parents would complain, and my supervisor would question my attention to detail. I knelt by the pool, already calculating how long the repair would take, when my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the adult faith formation planning meeting at the parish, starting in just thirty minutes. As the priest, I was expected to lead the session, set the tone for the year, and inspire the team. Both roles demanded my presence, my focus, and my care. I felt the weight of the expectations pressing in from both sides: the safety and order of the pool, the spiritual guidance of my community. My heart pounded as I stared at the broken rope, the clock ticking down, torn between two worlds that needed me at the very same moment."}
