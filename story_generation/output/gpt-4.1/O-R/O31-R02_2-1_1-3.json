My radio crackled with urgent updates\u2014tensions were rising, and I was expected to keep order, to enforce the law with a firm hand if necessary. Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a message from Mary, a parishioner from my church. She asked if I might have time to talk soon, nothing urgent, just a need for guidance. I could almost hear her gentle voice, seeking comfort and understanding. But here I was, surrounded by anger and fear, expected to be the authority, the enforcer. I felt the weight of my priestly collar, invisible beneath my uniform, reminding me of my other calling\u2014to listen, to counsel, to offer peace. The demands of both roles pressed in on me, each expecting something different, something vital. I stood at the edge of the crowd, torn between the chaos before me and the quiet plea for help waiting in my pocket, unsure which part of myself I could answer first."}
