She asked for access to the files, explaining she needed them to prepare a report for the partners. As a lawyer, I knew the rules\u2014client confidentiality is sacred, and only those directly involved should see these files. But she looked anxious, clearly under pressure to prove herself. I hesitated, feeling the weight of her expectation and the firm\u2019s need for efficiency.\n\nMy phone buzzed. A reminder: I was scheduled to deliver the Friday sermon in just a few hours. The community had already shared the topic, and I was the only speaker. As an imam, I couldn\u2019t let them down; the congregation counted on me for guidance and inspiration. But the files still needed my attention, and the assistant waited for my answer. My mind raced, torn between my duty to protect my client\u2019s trust and my responsibility to my community. The clock ticked, and I felt the pressure mounting from both sides, each demanding my presence, my integrity, and my time."}
