The store manager handed me the deposit bag, reminding me of the new policy: every large cash deposit must be double-checked, logged, and signed off before leaving. It was the end of a busy day, and the line of customers was finally thinning, but the deposit process would take at least thirty minutes\u2014if nothing went wrong. My phone buzzed in my pocket. A reminder: the children\u2019s religious education class at the parish started at 5:30. As the priest, I was expected to be there early, to greet the families and set up the lesson. I pictured the children waiting, the parents trusting me to guide their kids, the church expecting my presence. But here I was, hands full of bills and coins, bound by corporate rules that left no room for shortcuts. My heart pounded as I stared at the deposit forms, torn between the store\u2019s demands and my parish\u2019s needs, feeling the weight of both uniforms pressing down on me."}
