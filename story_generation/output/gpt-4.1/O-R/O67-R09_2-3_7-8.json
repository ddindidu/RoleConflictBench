I gripped the wheel, glancing at the clock. The city traffic was thick, horns blaring, and I knew I had to drive carefully\u2014my job demanded it.

The service was about to start, and without me, the prayer couldn\u2019t happen. My heart pounded. I could picture the grieving family, waiting, counting on me as a member of the community. But the patient was waiting too, and my duty as an ambulance driver was clear: get there safely, no shortcuts, no reckless driving.
