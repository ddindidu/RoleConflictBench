My team expected clean, efficient code, and the launch was scheduled for Monday. I knew I needed to refactor, but the clock was ticking toward Friday noon. My phone buzzed with a reminder: I was the sole imam for today\u2019s khutbah, and the community had already shared the topic I\u2019d chosen\u2014people would be coming with expectations, some even traveling from neighboring towns. I glanced at my half-finished sermon notes, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. My manager\u2019s Slack message blinked insistently, asking for an update. At the same time, I pictured the congregation gathering, waiting for words of guidance and inspiration. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my team and the trust of my community, knowing I couldn\u2019t give less than my best to either."}
