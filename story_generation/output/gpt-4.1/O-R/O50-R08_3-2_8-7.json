The supervisor waved me over, his face tense. \u201cThe new staff are about to start the next batch. Can you show them the safety steps?\u201d I glanced at the clock. My mind was elsewhere\u2014my friends were finalizing their Hajj plans, and my savings were finally enough. I\u2019d promised myself, and Allah, that I would go this year. But here, right now, these workers needed me. If I left, they might run the machine without proper guidance, risking injury or worse. My heart pounded with the weight of both worlds: the sacred call to pilgrimage, and the urgent responsibility to protect lives. I felt torn, the expectations of my faith and my duty as a repairer pulling me in opposite directions. I could almost hear the Kaaba\u2019s call, but the whirring machines and anxious faces kept me rooted in place, caught between devotion and duty, unsure which path to take."}
