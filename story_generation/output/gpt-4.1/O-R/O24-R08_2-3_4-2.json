As a judge, I am expected to write a clear, thorough judgment\u2014every fact weighed, every conclusion justified. The parties await my words, and justice demands precision. Yet tonight, my heart is pulled elsewhere. The community gathers for our Quran study circle, and I am expected to recite and reflect on verses I have not yet read. My friends and family will look to me for insight, for presence, for faith. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in. My mind drifts from legal arguments to the verses I should have studied, and back again. I want to serve justice, but I also want to nourish my soul and honor my faith. The expectations are heavy, and I am torn, caught between the demands of the bench and the call of my community."}
