As a telemarketer, I was supposed to take my break at the assigned time, but today the call volume was unusually light, and my supervisor had mentioned we could be flexible. I felt a rare sense of freedom, but it was Sunday morning, and my church service was about to start. As a Christian, I knew how important it was to be present, to worship and connect with my community. I could technically shift my break and log off for the service, but I also knew the expectation to stick to my work hours, to be available in case the calls picked up. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward my faith and my job. I stared at the phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down on me, unsure which expectation I should honor."}
