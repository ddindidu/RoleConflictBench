As a delivery person, my job was clear: leave the parcel safely at the doorstep, snap a photo, and move on. But as I approached the house, I saw my friend Raj standing at the edge of the yard, his face tense. Two men were arguing with him, voices sharp, accusing him of something he didn\u2019t do. My heart pounded. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma, to act with integrity and protect others from injustice. But my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014deliveries were timed, and I couldn\u2019t risk a failed drop. If I intervened, I might miss the delivery window, risking my job. If I walked away, I\u2019d betray my values and my friend. The package felt heavier in my hands as I stood frozen, torn between my duty to my work and my duty to what I believed was right."}
