The law is clear: I must write a thorough, reasoned judgment within the month, and the parties deserve nothing less. My mind churns through the evidence, the arguments, the precedents. Yet, as I reach for my pen, the convent bell tolls. Sister Agnes appears at my door, her eyes gentle. \u201cMaria from the parish is waiting. She needs guidance\u2014she\u2019s struggling with her faith.\u201d I nod, heart heavy. As a nun, I am called to listen, to offer comfort and spiritual wisdom, especially in moments of crisis. But the clock ticks, and the court expects clarity and diligence. I feel torn\u2014my duty to justice and my vow to serve God\u2019s people both demand my full presence. I close my eyes, wrestling with the weight of these expectations, knowing I cannot give less than my whole self to either calling."}
