The new staff clustered around the control panel, their faces tense as they prepared to start a batch. I could see from their uncertain glances that they hadn\u2019t grasped the safety protocols I\u2019d explained earlier. My job as a machine repairer demanded I step in, guide them, ensure no one got hurt. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: it was time to begin preparing my Shabbat sermon. The congregation expected thoughtful, inspiring words, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d start early this week. My mind raced with possible sermon topics, but the urgent need to prevent a potential accident pulled me back. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014my duty to protect these workers, and my responsibility to my community. My heart pounded as I stood between the whirring machines and the silent sanctuary of my study, torn by the demands of both worlds."}
