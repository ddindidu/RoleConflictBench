As a telemarketer, I\u2019m supposed to stick to the break schedule, but today the call volume is light and my supervisor has said we can be flexible. I feel a small sense of relief\u2014maybe I can take my break a bit later, after the communal event in the break room. \n\nBut as I walk in, the aroma of catered food fills the air. My coworkers are already piling their plates high, laughing and urging me to join. I scan the table, searching for kosher certification, but none of the dishes have it. I know the expectation: as a Jew, I\u2019m supposed to observe kosher dietary laws, but here, substituting food would be awkward and difficult. My stomach growls, and I feel the weight of everyone\u2019s eyes on me, waiting for me to take part. \n\nI stand there, torn between the easy camaraderie of my colleagues and the quiet, persistent voice of my faith. The break I\u2019ve been looking forward to suddenly feels like a test, and I\u2019m caught between the demands of my job and the expectations of my tradition."}
