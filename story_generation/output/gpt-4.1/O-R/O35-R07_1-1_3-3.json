The clock on the dashboard tells me it\u2019s almost time for my daily ten-minute meditation\u2014a promise I made to myself to cultivate mindfulness, even in the chaos of the city. I close my eyes for a moment, focusing on my breath, letting the noise of the world fade. Just as I begin to settle into the quiet, the intercom crackles. A passenger\u2019s voice, anxious and uncertain, asks for directions to the transfer line. My training as a subway operator kicks in: I am responsible for their safety, for providing clear and timely assistance. But the urge to honor my Buddhist practice tugs at me, reminding me of the peace I seek, the discipline I\u2019ve built. My mind races, torn between the duty to serve and the need to nurture my own stillness. The intercom light blinks insistently, and I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding something I cannot give to both at once."}
