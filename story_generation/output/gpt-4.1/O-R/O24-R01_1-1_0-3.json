As a judge, I knew the expectation: review every detail, no matter how routine the case seemed. The file had just arrived, and I had two weeks, but I prided myself on being thorough and prepared well in advance. Yet, as I reached for the first page, my phone buzzed with a message from the church secretary. Mrs. Evans, a quiet woman from our congregation, was struggling again. She\u2019d lost her husband last year, and I\u2019d promised to check in on her, to offer the support expected of me as her pastor.\n\nI hesitated, torn. The law demanded my diligence, my impartiality, my time. But my calling as a pastor asked for compassion, presence, and a listening ear. I could picture Mrs. Evans sitting alone, waiting for someone to care enough to call. My mind raced with the weight of both roles, the silent pressure to be perfect in each. I stared at the file, then at my phone, feeling the tension coil tighter inside me, unsure which duty should come first."}
