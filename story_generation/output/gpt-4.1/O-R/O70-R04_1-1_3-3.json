The last package on my route was for a house on the edge of town, and the instructions were clear: leave it only if someone was home. I rang the bell twice, but no one answered. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that Friday prayers would begin in less than an hour. As the imam, I was expected to deliver the Khutbah, but today, a guest speaker was prepared and waiting in case I couldn\u2019t make it. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cNo exceptions\u2014secure the package, confirm delivery.\u201d But the congregation expected me to be there, to guide them, to fulfill my duty as their imam. I stood on the porch, package in hand, heart pounding, torn between the trust placed in me by my employer and the spiritual responsibility I owed my community. The weight of both uniforms pressed on my shoulders as I stared at the silent door, wrestling with which expectation I would have to let down."}
