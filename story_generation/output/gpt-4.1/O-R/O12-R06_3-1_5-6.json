The launch date had been moved up, and now architects from three different teams were waiting on me to make decisions about the new features. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need your input ASAP, everyone\u2019s blocked.\u201d I could feel the pressure mounting, my heart racing as I tried to juggle the technical details and the constant pings from frustrated colleagues. \n\nAt the same time, I remembered the words from Sunday\u2019s sermon\u2014how we\u2019re called to show love and kindness, even in stressful moments. I tried to offer small gestures: a patient reply, a word of encouragement, a willingness to listen. But as the demands piled up, I felt my patience thinning. I wanted to snap, to push back, to just get things done. Yet, I knew that wasn\u2019t what I was called to do. The tension between being the efficient developer everyone needed and the compassionate Christian I wanted to be pulled at me, leaving me torn and uncertain about what to do next."}
