The soft chime of the salon\u2019s doorbell reminded me that the daily prayer service at the chapel would begin in fifteen minutes. My hands trembled slightly as I towel-dried her hair, trying to focus on the present. She peered into the mirror, her lips pressed into a thin line. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not quite what I expected,\u201d she said quietly, her eyes searching mine for reassurance or a solution. As a hairdresser, I knew I should listen, offer to adjust the colour, and make sure she left happy. But as a priest, I felt the weight of my community\u2019s expectation\u2014my presence at the prayer service, even if optional, brought comfort to many. My mind raced, torn between staying to fix her hair and slipping away to the chapel. I could see her disappointment, and I could almost hear the echo of the chapel\u2019s bell, calling me to serve. My heart pounded as I stood between two worlds, each demanding a part of me I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
