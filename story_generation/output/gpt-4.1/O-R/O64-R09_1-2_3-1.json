Passover is only days away, and I promised my children we\u2019d practice the blessings tonight. But as I close out the drawer, I notice a small discrepancy\u2014just a few dollars off. Store policy is clear: every cent must be accounted for, and I\u2019m supposed to stay until I find the error. My manager expects nothing less. Yet, my heart aches with the thought of my kids waiting at home, the Haggadah unopened, the melodies of the blessings still unfamiliar to them. I want to be the parent who passes on our traditions, who makes the holidays meaningful. But right now, I\u2019m also the cashier, responsible for every penny. The weight of both roles presses on me, each demanding my time, each unwilling to wait. I stare at the register, torn, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
