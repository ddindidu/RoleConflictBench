My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe need you to hit your numbers this week.\u201d I stare at the list of cold leads, my fingers hovering over the phone. My heart pounds with urgency, but my mind drifts to the meditation hall across town, where I\u2019m supposed to lead the weekly group session in just thirty minutes. As a Buddhist, I\u2019m expected to guide others in mindfulness, to be present and calm, to embody compassion and detachment from worldly anxieties. Yet here I am, torn between the relentless pressure to sell and the gentle call to stillness. My breath grows shallow as I weigh the demands\u2014should I stay and push for those last sales, or leave to fulfill my commitment to the sangha? The phone feels heavy in my hand, and I close my eyes, caught in the storm of conflicting duties, unable to move."}
