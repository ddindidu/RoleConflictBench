The deadline loomed; the client expected revisions by tomorrow morning, and I knew how much depended on getting this right. My phone buzzed. It was Miriam, her voice trembling. Her father had just passed away, and the family needed me to officiate the funeral\u2014today, if possible. As their rabbi, I was their guide through grief, the one to offer comfort and tradition in their darkest hour. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the architect\u2019s responsibility to deliver precision and innovation, the rabbi\u2019s sacred duty to be present in moments of loss. My heart ached for Miriam, but my mind raced with the unfinished plans and the promises I\u2019d made. I stared at the blueprints, then at my phone, torn between two callings, each demanding all of me, each impossible to ignore."}
