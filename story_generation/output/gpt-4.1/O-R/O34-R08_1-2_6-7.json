The hum of voices and the blinking lights are my world. An aircraft is about to cross into the neighboring sector, and I coordinate with the next controller, making sure the handoff is seamless. Every second counts; a mistake could mean chaos in the sky. My colleagues rely on me, and I can\u2019t let them down.\n\nBut my heart aches with another longing. This year, my friends are going for Hajj. I\u2019ve saved for years, setting aside every spare coin, dreaming of standing in the holy city. The time is now\u2014if I don\u2019t go, I might lose my chance. Yet, the leave I\u2019d need would leave my team short-staffed during the busiest season. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me: the duty to my faith, the responsibility to my team. My hands tremble slightly as I guide the plane, torn between the sky and my soul, knowing I must choose, but not yet ready to decide."}
