The departmental meeting was tomorrow, and my supervisor had emphasized the importance of presenting our preliminary findings with clarity and precision. I felt the weight of responsibility\u2014my team depended on me to document every detail, to uphold the integrity of our research. Yet, my phone buzzed with a gentle reminder: the monastery\u2019s annual festival began at dawn. As a committed Buddhist, I was expected to help with the preparations, to join the community in chanting and setting up the altar, to be present in both body and spirit. The festival was sacred, a time of unity and reflection, and the monks counted on my support. My mind raced between the sterile glow of the lab and the warm, incense-filled halls of the monastery. I felt torn, pulled by the demands of scientific rigor and spiritual devotion, each expecting my full presence. My heart pounded as I tried to imagine how I could possibly honor both, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
