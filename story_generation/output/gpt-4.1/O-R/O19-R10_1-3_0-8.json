The label matched the medication, and I felt the familiar satisfaction of fulfilling my duty\u2014accuracy was everything in my profession. But as I handed the medicine to the patient, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the festival was tonight. My family had already traveled ahead, expecting me to join them for the rituals and offerings. As a Hindu, participating in this festival was not just tradition\u2014it was a sacred responsibility, a way to honor my faith and ancestors. Yet, the pharmacy was short-staffed, and my shift wouldn\u2019t end for hours. My mind raced with the weight of both worlds: the trust my patients placed in me, and the devotion my family and community expected. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to yield. The clock ticked, and I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
