My client, Mrs. Feldman, expected everything spotless, and I prided myself on never letting supplies run out. The next cleaning was in three days, but tomorrow was the only day I could shop for more. I glanced at my phone and saw the reminder: I was scheduled to chant Torah at synagogue tomorrow morning. It wasn\u2019t just any service\u2014my portion was important, and I\u2019d promised the rabbi I\u2019d be there. My community counted on me, and I felt honored to serve. But Mrs. Feldman also relied on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let her down. The store\u2019s hours overlapped with the service, and I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once. My mind raced, torn between my commitment to my faith and my responsibility as a cleaner. I felt the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my presence, each expecting me not to fail."}
