The court expects clarity, precision, and thoroughness in my judgment\u2014every fact weighed, every conclusion justified. Thirty days is the deadline, but the pressure is immediate, the responsibility heavy. My mind races with the details: witness credibility, statutory interpretation, the impact of my words on real lives. Yet, as a Buddhist, I have promised myself a ten-minute window of quiet, a pause for mindfulness and meditation. I feel the tug of both worlds\u2014one demanding relentless analysis, the other inviting stillness. My chest tightens as I glance at the clock. If I stop now, will I lose my train of thought? If I don\u2019t, am I betraying my commitment to inner peace? The expectations clash within me, the judge and the Buddhist, each insistent, each necessary. I close my eyes, caught in the tension, uncertain which voice to heed first."}
