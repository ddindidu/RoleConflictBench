But today, my mind was elsewhere. The monastery\u2019s annual festival began at dawn, and I had promised the abbot I\u2019d help with the preparations\u2014setting up lanterns, arranging offerings, welcoming the community. It was a commitment I made not just as a volunteer, but as a Buddhist, honoring the sangha and my own spiritual path. The passenger\u2019s urgency pressed on me, but so did the quiet expectation of my fellow practitioners, counting on my presence. My hands tightened on the steering wheel, heart caught between the city\u2019s demands and the monastery\u2019s gentle call. I stared at the road ahead, feeling the weight of both worlds, unsure which direction to take."}
