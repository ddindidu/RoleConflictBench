My shift was almost over, and I looked forward to a quiet evening at home, finally able to recite and reflect on the Quran without interruption. It was something I\u2019d been yearning for all week\u2014a chance to reconnect with my faith, to find peace in the verses. Just as I was mentally preparing for that spiritual time, the intercom crackled. A passenger\u2019s voice, polite but uncertain, asked for directions to a connecting line. \n\nAs a subway operator, I knew my duty: ensure every passenger feels safe and supported, no matter how routine the request. But a part of me felt a twinge of impatience. I wanted to finish my shift, to not be delayed, to not have my evening of worship cut short. The expectation to serve clashed with my longing for spiritual fulfillment. I felt the tension rise inside me\u2014torn between the needs of those I serve and the needs of my own soul. My hand hovered over the intercom, my mind wrestling with which role to honor first."}
