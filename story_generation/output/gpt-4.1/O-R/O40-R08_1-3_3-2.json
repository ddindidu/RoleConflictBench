The client wanted a custom bookshelf, and I needed to estimate the materials and place the order by tonight if I wanted to meet the deadline. My mind was already calculating measurements and costs, but my phone buzzed with a reminder: the community Quran study circle was meeting in two hours. I hadn\u2019t read the assigned verses yet, let alone reflected on them. As a carpenter, I prided myself on never missing a deadline, always delivering quality work. But as a Muslim, I felt the weight of my commitment to deepen my understanding of the Quran and support my community. The expectation to be present, prepared, and engaged at the study circle pressed against the urgent need to finish my estimates and order supplies. My heart pounded as I looked from the order form to my Quran on the shelf, torn between the demands of my craft and my faith, unsure which responsibility should come first tonight."}
