The store is quiet now, but my mind is anything but. The manager\u2019s words echo in my head: \u201cDouble-check every bill, sign every slip, no shortcuts.\u201d Corporate audits are strict, and I know the consequences of a mistake. I glance at the clock\u2014almost closing time. \n\nBut as I sort the cash, my phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cBegin sermon prep for Shabbat.\u201d My congregation expects thoughtful, inspiring words, and I feel the weight of their trust. Ideas for the sermon swirl in my mind, but I can\u2019t let myself drift. If I rush the deposit, I risk an error; if I focus on the sermon, I might miss a counterfeit bill or miscount. \n\nI feel pulled in two directions\u2014one demanding precision and adherence to policy, the other calling for reflection and spiritual leadership. My chest tightens as I try to silence the rabbi within me, just for a moment, so I can finish the cashier\u2019s task. But the words for my sermon keep pressing at the edges of my thoughts, refusing to wait."}
