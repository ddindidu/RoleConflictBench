The ambulance rumbled beneath me as I navigated the city streets, moving it from the main station to the satellite location for the shift change. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDrive safely. No exceptions, even if you\u2019re running late.\u201d I knew the rules\u2014no lights, no sirens, just careful, responsible driving.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was my turn to chant the Torah portion at synagogue. I\u2019d promised weeks ago, and the rabbi had emphasized how important it was for me to be there on time. My family would be waiting, proud, expecting me to fulfill my commitment. The congregation counted on me.\n\nThe minutes ticked by, and traffic thickened. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I drove faster, I might make it to the service, but I\u2019d be risking safety and breaking protocol. If I followed the rules, I\u2019d disappoint my community and family. My hands tightened on the wheel, my heart pounding as I wrestled with the impossible choice between my duty as an ambulance driver and my responsibility as a Jew."}
