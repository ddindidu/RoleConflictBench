The line had finally thinned, but the manager handed me the deposit bag, reminding me to double-check every bill and fill out the log exactly as corporate required. I knew the process would take at least another half hour\u2014no shortcuts allowed, not if I wanted to keep my job. But tonight was the full moon, and the temple\u2019s evening chant would begin at 7:15 sharp. I\u2019d promised the sangha I\u2019d help set up the cushions and light incense, and my teacher always said punctuality was a form of respect. My heart pounded as I glanced between the deposit forms and the time on my phone. I could feel the weight of both worlds pressing in: the store\u2019s demand for precision and accountability, and the temple\u2019s call for presence and devotion. I stood at the counter, torn, the fluorescent lights buzzing above me, unable to move."}
