As a telemarketer, I was trained to remain calm, to answer every objection with patience and clarity, to never let my own feelings show. My supervisor expected me to keep him on the line, to turn his anger into a sale. But as he spoke, my phone buzzed with a message from Mary, a member of my congregation. She\u2019d been struggling lately, and I\u2019d promised to check in, to offer a word of comfort whenever she needed it. I could almost hear her loneliness in the silence between Mr. Jenkins\u2019 accusations. My heart ached to reach out, to be the pastor she needed, but my headset tethered me to my other role. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, my voice caught between reassurance and salesmanship, my mind torn by the demands of compassion and quotas."}
