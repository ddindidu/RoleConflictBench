This morning, a thick file landed on my desk\u2014another procedural matter, but the law demands I read it thoroughly before the hearing in two weeks. I know the importance of this responsibility; justice depends on my careful attention.\n\nBut as a devout Hindu, my mornings are sacred. My daily rituals\u2014prayers, chanting, and offerings\u2014must be performed at precise times, without omission. These practices are not just habits; they are the foundation of my spiritual life, a commitment I have never broken.\n\nNow, the file sits on my desk, its presence a silent demand. The clock ticks toward the hour of my morning puja. My mind races: if I start reading now, I\u2019ll miss the window for my rituals. If I delay, I risk being unprepared for court. The weight of both roles presses on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction. I close my eyes, feeling the tension coil inside me, knowing I must choose which duty to honor first."}
