The new operational procedures were crucial\u2014missing even a detail could mean risking passenger safety or my job. My phone buzzed quietly in my pocket. A message from Mother Superior: \u201cWe need you to lead the prayer vigil tonight. The archbishop will be present. It\u2019s an honor for our convent.\u201d My heart pounded. The vigil was scheduled to start just as my shift began. As a nun, I was expected to be a spiritual guide, to put faith and community above all else. But as a subway operator, I was trusted to keep the city moving, to be reliable and precise. I could feel the weight of both uniforms\u2014the habit beneath my work shirt, the cross under my ID badge. The supervisor called my name, and I felt the eyes of my colleagues and my sisters upon me, each expecting me to fulfill my duty. I closed my eyes, torn between the rails and the rosary, unsure which path to follow."}
