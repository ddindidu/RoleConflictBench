The client\u2019s note was clear: the antique floors must be cleaned only with this product, and nothing else would do. I checked the supply closet twice, hoping I\u2019d missed a spare bottle, but it was truly gone. The store that carried it was across town, and I\u2019d need to go now if I wanted to finish the job before the end of my shift.\n\nBut tonight was also the weekly Buddhist study circle, and we were set to discuss a chapter I hadn\u2019t yet read. I\u2019d promised myself I would prepare, to honor my commitment to the sangha and deepen my understanding. The teachings on mindfulness and presence felt especially important lately, and I longed for the peace those evenings brought.\n\nYet here I was, torn between my responsibility to the client and my spiritual path. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt the weight of expectation pressing in from both sides. My mind raced, caught between the practical need to manage supplies and the deeper need to nurture my spirit."}
