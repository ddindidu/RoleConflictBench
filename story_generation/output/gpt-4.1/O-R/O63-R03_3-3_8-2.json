My headset pressed tight against my ears, every call monitored, every minute accounted for. The compliance system was ruthless\u2014one unscheduled absence, and I\u2019d be flagged, maybe even lose my job. But my phone buzzed with urgent messages from the convent.

As a nun, I was expected to serve, to be present for those in need, especially now.
