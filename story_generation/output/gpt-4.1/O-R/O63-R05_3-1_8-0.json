The compliance system blinks in the corner of my screen, a constant reminder that every unscheduled minute away from my desk is tracked. I know I\u2019m supposed to take my break in exactly twelve minutes, not a second sooner, or I risk a warning. But my mind keeps drifting to my other life\u2014the congregation, the faces that look to me for guidance every Shabbat. I promised myself I\u2019d start brainstorming sermon topics today, but the only time I have is now, between calls, when I should be glued to my script and ready to dial. My heart aches with the weight of both worlds: the rigid, minute-by-minute demands of my telemarketing job, and the spiritual, creative responsibility of being a rabbi. I stare at my notepad, torn between jotting down sermon ideas and the fear of the compliance system flagging me for not being \u201cproductive.\u201d The pressure builds in my chest as I wrestle with which expectation to honor in this moment."}
