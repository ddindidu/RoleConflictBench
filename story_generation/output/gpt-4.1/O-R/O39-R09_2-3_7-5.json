My hard hat feels heavy as the foreman calls everyone over for the daily safety briefing\u2014mandatory, no exceptions. I glance at my watch; two minutes left. My stomach rumbles, reminding me I skipped breakfast, hoping there\u2019d be something kosher at the communal meal after the briefing. But as I peek at the catering table, my heart sinks. None of the dishes have certification, and I know substituting food will be nearly impossible here. My team expects me to be present, focused, and part of the group, especially during these briefings and shared meals. But my faith demands I keep kosher, even if it means standing apart, maybe even offending someone or drawing unwanted attention. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my responsibility to my crew, my loyalty to my beliefs. The foreman\u2019s voice grows louder, calling us over. I hesitate, caught between the expectations of my team and the demands of my faith, unsure which part of myself I\u2019ll have to set aside."}
