It was almost time for the evening service at synagogue, and I\u2019d promised my family I\u2019d be there. But as I turned back to the patient in room 204, I saw her struggling to lift her spoon, her face twisted in pain. She needed help\u2014gentle encouragement, maybe even someone to feed her. That was my job as a nursing assistant: to be present, to offer comfort, to make sure no one felt alone in their suffering. Yet, my faith called me too. Attending services wasn\u2019t just a habit; it was a commitment, a way to connect with my community and with God. I could hear the distant melody of prayers in my mind, but here, the reality of suffering was immediate. My heart pounded as I stood between the two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which path to take."}
