Not a safety hazard, but the facility manager had been clear: everything should look perfect, always. I knelt to straighten them, feeling the weight of the whistle around my neck. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the Martinez family, reminding me about their child\u2019s final sacrament preparation session\u2014today, and it was the only time they could all be together before the big day. As a priest, I knew how important this was, not just for the child but for the whole family\u2019s faith journey. But the pool was busy, and my supervisor expected me to keep everything in order, especially with the upcoming inspection. I stood there, torn, the sun glinting off the water, the sound of laughter and splashing mixing with the echo of church bells in my mind. Both roles demanded my presence, my attention, my care. I felt the tension coil in my chest, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and that someone would be disappointed, no matter what I chose."}
