The machines were running hotter than they should, their last maintenance window missed because of a supply delay. If I didn\u2019t act soon, we risked a costly breakdown\u2014maybe even a shutdown. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime. You\u2019re the only one who knows these systems inside out.\u201d\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the bar mitzvah. Months of preparation, a family counting on me to guide their son through this rite of passage. I could picture the congregation gathering, the boy\u2019s nervous smile, his parents\u2019 hopeful eyes. As their rabbi, I was expected to be present, to lead, to offer wisdom and comfort.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest. The machines needed me now, but so did my community. I stood frozen between the humming engines and the sacred texts in my bag, heart pounding, torn by the impossible demands of duty and devotion."}
