The quarterly tax filing deadline loomed, and as the company\u2019s accountant, I knew the weight of ensuring every detail was correct. Compliance wasn\u2019t just a rule\u2014it was my responsibility, and any mistake could have serious consequences. My phone buzzed, interrupting my focus. It was an email from a young couple, asking if I could officiate their wedding next year. As their rabbi, I felt honored by their request, knowing how important it was for them to have spiritual guidance and a meaningful ceremony. But I hesitated, realizing that the date they mentioned was the same week as the next tax deadline. My mind raced, torn between my duty to my clients and my commitment to my congregation. I felt the pressure mounting, the expectations of both roles pulling me in opposite directions. I stared at the screen, heart pounding, unsure how I could possibly meet the demands of both worlds."}
