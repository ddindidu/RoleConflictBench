The new feature was almost done, but the senior devs kept flagging performance issues. \u201cRefactor this loop,\u201d one wrote. \u201cOptimize memory usage here,\u201d another chimed in. I knew I was expected to deliver clean, efficient code, and the pressure to meet the team\u2019s standards gnawed at me. At the same time, it was a rare day off, and I\u2019d planned to relax at home with my family. I\u2019d changed into a loose t-shirt and shorts, comfortable and casual, since it was just us. But as the code review dragged on, I realized I might need to hop on a video call to explain my choices. The thought made my stomach twist\u2014appearing on camera in clothes that didn\u2019t meet my usual standards of modesty felt wrong, even if it was just colleagues. I stared at the blinking cursor, torn between the demands of my profession and my faith, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in from either side."}
