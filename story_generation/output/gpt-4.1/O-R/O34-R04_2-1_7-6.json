My headset buzzed with voices\u2014colleagues coordinating handoffs, pilots requesting vectors, the tension in the room thick as the thunder outside. Every decision I made as an air traffic controller had to be precise, every instruction clear, especially now, with the weather forcing so many reroutes. I felt the weight of responsibility for hundreds of lives in the air.\n\nBetween transmissions, my phone vibrated.
