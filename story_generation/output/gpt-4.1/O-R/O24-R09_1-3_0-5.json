As a judge, I was expected to review every detail, even for a routine procedural matter. The case was scheduled in two weeks, but I prided myself on being thorough and prepared. My colleagues often remarked on my diligence, and I knew the expectation was to maintain that standard.\n\nBut tonight, I was at a communal event, surrounded by friends and acquaintances. The aroma of the catered meal filled the hall, and my stomach grumbled. I scanned the buffet, searching for kosher certification, but found none. Substituting food would be nearly impossible; I hadn\u2019t brought anything from home, and the hosts had gone to great effort. As a Jew, I was expected to observe kosher laws, a commitment I\u2019d never wavered from, even in challenging situations.\n\nMy mind raced between the demands of my profession and my faith. Should I slip away to review the case file, or stay and navigate the awkwardness of refusing the meal? The weight of both roles pressed in, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I felt the tension knotting in my chest."}
