My phone buzzed again\u2014opposing counsel, relentless, demanding answers. They wanted information I held, information that could devastate my client\u2019s case. As a lawyer, I was bound by confidentiality, sworn to protect my client\u2019s secrets, no matter the pressure. But tonight, the stakes felt different. The information they sought wasn\u2019t just legal ammunition; it touched on a moral wrong, something that, as a Christian, I believed should not be hidden. My faith called me to honesty, to stand for what was right, even if it meant personal cost. Yet, my oath as a lawyer demanded silence, loyalty, and discretion. The weight of both worlds pressed on my chest, each expectation pulling me in opposite directions. I stared at the phone, my heart pounding, torn between the law I\u2019d pledged to uphold and the faith that shaped my conscience."}
