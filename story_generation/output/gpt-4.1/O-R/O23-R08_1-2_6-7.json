The city lights blinked below, and I tried to relax, but my mind was elsewhere. Earlier that day, I\u2019d received a call from my friends\u2014they were booking their tickets for Hajj, and they wanted me to join. I\u2019d been saving for years, and this was the season. My heart ached with longing; performing Hajj is a pillar of my faith, and I felt the weight of expectation from my family and community.\n\nBut tonight, as I mingled with colleagues, a partner from another firm leaned in, lowering his voice. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the real story with your new client? I\u2019ve heard rumors.\u201d His tone was casual, but I felt a jolt of anxiety. As a lawyer, I\u2019m bound by confidentiality, and even a hint could breach my ethical duty. Yet, the pressure to fit in, to share just enough to be part of the group, pressed on me.\n\nInside, I wrestled with the demands of my profession and my faith, both asking for unwavering commitment, both pulling me in different directions."}
