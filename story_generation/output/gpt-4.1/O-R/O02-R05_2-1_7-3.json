My engineering manager\u2019s email blinked at the top of my inbox: \u201cNeed your time estimates for the new feature by noon. Roadmap depends on it.\u201d I knew the team was waiting, and my numbers would set the pace for the whole quarter. I opened the specs, mind already mapping dependencies and risks.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the adult education class at the synagogue. I was supposed to teach about the weekly Torah portion, and a few regulars had already messaged to say they were looking forward to it. Even though it was optional, I knew how much these sessions meant to them, especially the ones who rarely found time for study.\n\nI felt the pressure building. As an engineer, I was expected to be precise, reliable, and responsive. As a rabbi, I was supposed to be present, nurturing, and available for questions, no matter how small the group. Both roles demanded my full attention, right now. My mind raced, torn between the spreadsheet and the sacred text, between deadlines and devotion, knowing I couldn\u2019t give both what they deserved."}
