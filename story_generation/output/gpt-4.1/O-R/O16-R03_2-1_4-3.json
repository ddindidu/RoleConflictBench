He had just learned he would live with diabetes for the rest of his life, and his voice trembled as he asked about insulin, diet, and what this meant for his future. I felt the weight of my white coat, the responsibility to guide him through this new reality with patience and compassion. My watch vibrated softly\u2014a reminder that morning prayers would begin in five minutes. The chapel was just down the hall, and as a nun, I was expected to be present, to join my sisters in devotion and uphold the rhythm of our spiritual life. My heart pounded with the pressure of both worlds. Mr. Alvarez needed me, but so did my community. I could not be in two places at once. The gentle chime of the hospital intercom mingled with the distant sound of the chapel bell, and I felt torn, standing between my calling to heal and my vow to pray."}
