The safety audit was in two hours, and I still hadn\u2019t recalibrated the centrifuge or replaced the cracked beaker. My mind raced through the checklist, knowing that even a minor oversight could jeopardize our funding and, more importantly, the safety of my team. As I reached for the maintenance log, my phone buzzed. It was a message from Sarah, a member of my congregation. She was waiting in my office, desperate for guidance about a life-altering decision. I could hear the tremor in her voice from her message, the kind of pain that couldn\u2019t wait. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my duty to uphold the highest standards in the lab, and my calling to offer comfort and wisdom to someone in spiritual crisis. My hands trembled as I stood between the sterile hum of the lab and the quiet sanctuary of my office, torn by the impossible demands of science and faith, knowing I could not give my best to both at the same time."}
