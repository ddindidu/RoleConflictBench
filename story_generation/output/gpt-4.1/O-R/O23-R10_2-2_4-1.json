As a lawyer, I had a contested motion scheduled in court that morning\u2014a crucial hearing for my client, who depended on my preparation and presence to defend their interests. The file sat open on my desk, notes and arguments swirling in my mind, demanding my full attention. Yet, as a practicing Hindu, I was also expected to light the lamp and offer prayers at my home altar, a daily ritual that grounded me and honored my faith. My mother\u2019s gentle reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cNever begin your day without seeking blessings.\u201d But the clock ticked relentlessly, and I felt the pressure mounting. If I paused for my prayers, I risked being late or unprepared for court. If I skipped the ritual, guilt and unease would follow me into the courtroom. Torn between my duty to my client and my devotion to my faith, I stood in the hallway, heart pounding, unable to move forward or back, caught in the tension of two worlds that both demanded all of me."}
