My phone buzzed with the day\u2019s first delivery: a package that had to be left at a customer\u2019s doorstep before 7 a.m. The instructions were clear\u2014no signature needed, but I had to ensure it was safe, hidden from the street, and snap a photo as proof. As I loaded the box into my van, my mind drifted to the monastery. Today was the annual festival, the one day our community gathered before dawn to prepare offerings and chant together. I\u2019d promised the head monk I\u2019d help set up the altar, a commitment I\u2019d made months ago, rooted in my wish to serve and deepen my practice.\n\nBut now, the delivery route overlapped with the festival\u2019s start. If I delayed the package, I\u2019d risk a complaint and possibly my job. If I skipped the festival, I\u2019d let down my teacher and sangha, missing the rare chance to be part of something sacred. My heart pounded as I sat behind the wheel, torn between duty and devotion, the weight of both roles pressing in as the sky began to lighten."}
