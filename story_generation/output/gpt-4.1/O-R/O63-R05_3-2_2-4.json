I\u2019ve been with your company for years, and now you want my credit card again?\u201d My script fluttered uselessly in my hand. As a telemarketer, I was expected to stay calm, answer every question, and turn objections into sales. My supervisor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cDon\u2019t let them off the line. Explain everything. Close the deal.\u201d\n\nBut my eyes kept darting to the clock. In fifteen minutes, I was supposed to be in the synagogue classroom, where a dozen children would be waiting for their weekly Torah lesson. As their rabbi, I was expected to be present, patient, and prepared\u2014to guide them through the stories and laws that shaped our lives. I imagined their eager faces, the parents trusting me to teach their children.\n\nMy heart pounded. I couldn\u2019t abandon Mr. Feldman mid-call, but I couldn\u2019t let my students down either. The demands of both roles pressed in, and I sat frozen, torn between the voice on the phone and the voices waiting for me in the classroom."}
