They fumbled with the controls, clearly unsure, and I knew the batch they were about to run could be dangerous if they missed the safety steps. As the machine repairer, it was my job to step in, guide them, and make sure no one got hurt. But just as I opened my mouth, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that it was almost time for lunch, and I\u2019d promised myself to keep kosher, even at work. The break room was stocked with kosher snacks, but if I got caught up here, I\u2019d miss my chance to eat before the next shift. My stomach tightened with hunger, but the anxious looks on the staff\u2019s faces pulled at me. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in: the responsibility to keep everyone safe, and the commitment to my faith and its daily rituals. I hesitated, torn between stepping in right now or slipping away for a quick meal, knowing that either choice meant letting down an important part of myself."}
