The architects from the other teams were waiting for my input on the new feature design, and the launch date had just been moved up. My manager\u2019s message was clear: \u201cWe need your decisions by end of day, or the whole project stalls.\u201d I felt the pressure mounting, knowing everyone was counting on me to keep things moving.\n\nBut then, I overheard a conversation in the break room. My friend, Arjun, was being blamed for a bug he didn\u2019t cause. The lead was harsh, dismissing his explanations. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for what\u2019s right, to follow dharma and not turn away from injustice. My heart pounded. I knew I should speak up for Arjun, but if I did, I\u2019d lose precious time and risk missing the deadline, letting my team down. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I couldn\u2019t give to the other. I sat frozen, torn between my duty to my team and my responsibility to my friend."}
