The team\u2019s messages kept popping up\u2014everyone was waiting for my module, the core piece that would let the rest of the build move forward. I could feel the pressure mounting, the expectation that I, as the lead engineer, would deliver a solution quickly and flawlessly. But as the clock ticked past noon, I felt another pull inside me. It was time for my daily puja, the ritual that grounds me, connects me to something deeper. Lately, I\u2019d been whispering a short mantra under my breath, hoping it would be enough, but guilt gnawed at me for not performing the full ritual. My family expected me to uphold our traditions, and I expected it of myself too. Yet, the thought of stepping away from my desk, even for a few minutes, seemed impossible. The team needed me. My faith needed me. I sat frozen, torn between the demands of my work and the quiet call of my beliefs, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in from either side."}
