The hearing was in two weeks, but I knew the expectation: review every detail, anticipate every question, ensure no oversight. My chambers were quiet, but my mind was not. In the next room, my children\u2019s voices drifted in, their laughter a bittersweet melody. The holiday was approaching fast, and I had promised to teach them the blessings, to pass on the words my own parents had taught me. They were counting on me to guide them, to keep our traditions alive. I glanced at the file, then at the clock. The demands of the bench pressed on me, but so did the pull of my faith and my family. I felt the tension coil in my chest, the impossible choice between the law and the legacy I wanted to leave my children. My hands hovered over the file, my heart torn between two worlds, each expecting all of me."}
