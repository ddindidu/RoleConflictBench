As a construction laborer, I was expected to sweep up my area, making sure every nail and splinter was cleared away. Safety and cleanliness were drilled into us\u2014no shortcuts, no excuses. But as I gripped the broom, I felt the familiar tug of my other life. As a Hindu, I was supposed to perform my daily rituals, a time to light incense, offer water, and chant prayers. Lately, I\u2019d been whispering a short mantra under my breath, hoping it was enough. But today, the guilt pressed harder. My supervisor\u2019s eyes were on me, expecting the floor spotless before we left. My heart ached, torn between the duty to my job and the longing to honor my faith properly. The broom felt heavy in my hands, and the mantra caught in my throat. I stood there, caught between the demands of the world outside and the quiet call of devotion within, unsure which voice to answer first."}
