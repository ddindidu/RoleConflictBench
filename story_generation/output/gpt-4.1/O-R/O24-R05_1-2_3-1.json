As a judge, I am expected to draft a clear and detailed scheduling order for a new case, and the deadline looms at the end of the week. The legal language must be precise, the instructions unambiguous\u2014justice depends on it. Yet, as I glance at my calendar, I am reminded that Shabbat is approaching. As the rabbi of my congregation, I am also expected to prepare a meaningful sermon, to offer guidance and inspiration to my community. They look to me for spiritual leadership, for words that will carry them through the week. My mind races between statutes and scripture, between the demands of the law and the needs of my congregation. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each expecting my full attention, each unwilling to yield. My heart aches with the knowledge that I cannot give both my best at the same time. I close my eyes, wrestling with the impossible choice before me."}
