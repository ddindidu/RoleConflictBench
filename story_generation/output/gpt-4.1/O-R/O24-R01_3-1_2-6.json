The clock ticked loudly, reminding me I had less than an hour to review every detail and make a ruling that could change someone\u2019s life. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the community gathering was starting downstairs, and I was expected to share a story from scripture, to guide and comfort my congregation. I could already picture their expectant faces, waiting for words of hope and wisdom. But here, in my hands, was a case demanding my full attention, my legal mind, my impartiality. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me\u2014justice and compassion, law and faith. My heart raced as I tried to focus on the legal documents, but my mind kept drifting to the parable I\u2019d planned to share. I wondered how I could possibly meet the demands of both worlds, knowing that to fully honor one meant letting the other down."}
