My engineering team was gathered in the conference room, waiting for my input on the project timeline. They needed my expertise to estimate how long the next phase would take, and though the session was informal, my colleagues relied on my accuracy to keep things moving smoothly. At the same time, my congregation expected a thoughtful, inspiring sermon for the most important service of the year. I could picture the sanctuary filling with families, all looking to me for guidance and meaning. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014my team\u2019s trust in my technical judgment, my community\u2019s faith in my spiritual leadership. I stared at the blinking cursor on my laptop, torn between the calculations in my head and the words of comfort and hope I needed to find. The clock ticked, and I felt the tension rising, knowing I couldn\u2019t be fully present for both at once."}
