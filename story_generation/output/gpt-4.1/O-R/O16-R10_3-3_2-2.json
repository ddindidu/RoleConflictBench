The patient before me was gasping for breath, his skin clammy, his eyes pleading. As a doctor, I knew every second counted. I needed to focus, to analyze his symptoms, order the right tests, and make a diagnosis that could save his life. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder for my midday prayer. As a Hindu, I had always honored my commitment to daily rituals, never missing a single prayer, chant, or offering. My family and community expected this devotion, and I felt it deeply within myself.
