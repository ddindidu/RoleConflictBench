The symptoms didn\u2019t add up\u2014fever, joint pain, a rash that came and went. I\u2019d run every test I could think of, but nothing pointed to a clear diagnosis. My mind raced with possibilities, the weight of responsibility pressing on my shoulders. My patient was counting on me to find answers, to ease their suffering.\n\nBut tonight was also the community Quran study circle, and I hadn\u2019t read the assigned verses. As a Muslim, I was expected to come prepared, to recite and reflect with sincerity. The group would notice if I was unprepared, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down or miss the spiritual nourishment I so needed.\n\nI glanced at the clock, feeling the hours slip away. Should I stay and pore over medical journals, searching for a clue to help my patient? Or should I set aside the file, open the Quran, and prepare for the study circle? The expectations of both roles pulled at me, and I felt torn, caught between my duty as a doctor and my devotion as a Muslim."}
