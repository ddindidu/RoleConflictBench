The planning session was casual, and everyone knew the dates could shift if needed. Still, I was expected to give my best estimate for how long my part would take. As the discussion circled back to me, my manager leaned in and quietly suggested, \u201cIf you can shave a week off your estimate, it\u2019ll make us look good to the client. We can always adjust later.\u201d I knew the numbers he wanted weren\u2019t realistic, but the pressure to comply was strong.\n\nAt that moment, my mind raced. As an engineer, I was supposed to be practical and flexible, especially since the timeline wasn\u2019t set in stone. But as a Christian, honesty and integrity were non-negotiable. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014one urging me to play along for the team\u2019s benefit, the other reminding me that my word should be truthful, even in small things. My heart pounded as I stared at the numbers on my screen, caught between loyalty to my team and loyalty to my faith, unsure which voice to follow."}
