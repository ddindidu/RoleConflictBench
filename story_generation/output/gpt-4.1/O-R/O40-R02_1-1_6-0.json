He\u2019s heartbroken.\u201d I examined the toy, noting the delicate wheels and the cracked body. I knew it would take time and care to restore it properly, and she needed a quote before the end of the day. As I reached for my measuring tape, the church bell chimed softly in the distance\u2014a gentle reminder that the daily prayer service would begin in fifteen minutes. \n\nAs the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, even if today\u2019s service was optional. Some of the elderly parishioners relied on these moments of peace, and I knew my absence would disappoint them. Yet, Mrs. Patel\u2019s hope-filled eyes lingered on me, and I felt the weight of her trust. My hands hesitated between the toy and my prayer book, my mind torn by the demands of both roles. The minutes ticked by, and I stood in the middle of my workshop, heart pounding, caught between the needs of my craft and my calling."}
