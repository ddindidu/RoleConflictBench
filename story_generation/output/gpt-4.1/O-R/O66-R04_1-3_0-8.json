He\u2019d mentioned he was just meeting a friend for coffee, no rush at all. The city traffic was light, and I knew I could get him there safely and on time, as expected of any good taxi driver. My phone buzzed on the dashboard\u2014a message from the mosque committee. Someone had arrived at the mosque, desperate for guidance after a sudden loss. As the imam, I was expected to be there, to offer comfort and wisdom in moments of crisis. My heart pounded. I could picture the person waiting, eyes red, searching for hope. But here I was, behind the wheel, responsible for my passenger\u2019s safe journey. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding my presence, each urgent in its own way. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I wrestled with what to do next."}
