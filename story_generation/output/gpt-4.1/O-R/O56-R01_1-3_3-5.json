She smiled, asking if I could trim just a bit more off her fringe. I nodded, reaching for my scissors, determined to give her the perfect cut\u2014she always left generous tips and trusted me with her stories. As I combed her hair, my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket. I glanced at the screen: a message from the church deacon. There\u2019d been a fire in the neighborhood, and several families needed immediate support and counseling. My heart pounded. As a pastor, I was expected to be there, to comfort and guide those in crisis. But right now, Mrs. Lee was in my chair, expecting my full attention and care. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014one hand holding the scissors, the other itching to reach for my phone. My mind raced, torn between the gentle trust of my client and the desperate needs of my congregation, both expecting me to be present, to help, to care."}
