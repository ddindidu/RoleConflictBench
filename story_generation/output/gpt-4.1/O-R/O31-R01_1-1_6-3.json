As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness\u2014rules were rules, and this car was clearly in violation. But as I glanced at the dashboard, I recognized the crocheted cross hanging from the mirror. This was Mrs. Evans\u2019 car. She\u2019d lost her husband last month, and as her pastor, I\u2019d been checking in on her, offering comfort and a listening ear. I knew she was struggling, barely leaving the house except for groceries and church. The law said I should issue the ticket, but my heart ached at the thought of adding to her burdens. I felt the weight of my badge and my collar pressing down on me, each demanding something different. My hand trembled as I hesitated, torn between upholding the law and showing compassion to someone who needed it most."}
