My train leaves in twenty minutes,\u201d he pleaded, his voice tight with worry. As a taxi driver, I felt the familiar pressure to get him there safely and on time, weaving through the city\u2019s afternoon traffic. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the bar mitzvah ceremony I was to officiate was set to begin soon, a family waiting for me at the synagogue, counting on my presence for this once-in-a-lifetime moment. My rabbi\u2019s heart ached at the thought of disappointing them, of not being there to guide a young boy through his rite of passage. Yet, behind me, the passenger\u2019s urgency pressed in, his need just as real. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the duty to my passenger and the sacred responsibility to my congregation, feeling the weight of both roles pulling me in opposite directions as the minutes ticked away."}
