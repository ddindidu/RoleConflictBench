The sales manager\u2019s voice echoes in my mind: \u201cWe need three more deals to hit target, or we all lose our bonuses.\u201d I glance at the clock\u2014just an hour until my weekly study session with my kids. Every Thursday, I teach them about our Jewish heritage, stories of resilience, and the meaning behind our traditions. It\u2019s a promise I made to myself, and to them, to keep our history alive.\n\nBut the phones keep ringing, and my team\u2019s chat is buzzing with urgency. If I stay, I might close the gap and help everyone. If I leave, I keep my commitment to my children, showing them that our values come first. My heart pounds as I stare at the phone, torn between the pressure to perform at work and the responsibility to pass on my faith. The minutes tick by, and I wrestle with the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
