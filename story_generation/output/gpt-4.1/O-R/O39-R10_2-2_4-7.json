My mind was already drifting to the family ceremony tonight\u2014my mother had called twice to remind me not to be late, to come home clean and dressed in my best kurta. As I walked toward the gate, I spotted a small puddle of oil glistening on the walkway, right where the next crew would be coming through. The safety officer\u2019s words echoed in my head: \u201cWe all have to look out for each other. Even small spills can cause big accidents.\u201d I knew I should grab the mop and clean it up, but my watch told me I was already cutting it close. If I stopped now, I\u2019d be late, and my family would be disappointed. If I left, someone could get hurt, and I\u2019d be failing my responsibility to my coworkers. My heart pounded as I stood there, torn between duty to my job and devotion to my family and faith, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
