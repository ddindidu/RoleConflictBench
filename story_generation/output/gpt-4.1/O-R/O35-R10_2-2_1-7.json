The festival at home was about to begin, and my family was waiting for me to join the ceremony. I could almost hear the chants and smell the incense, my mother\u2019s voice reminding me to arrive on time, dressed in my best kurta. But up ahead, the signal flickered yellow\u2014a minor delay, but enough to throw off the schedule. My duty as a subway operator pressed on me: keep the train safe, avoid abrupt stops, and do everything possible to stay on time for the passengers counting on me. My phone buzzed in my pocket, a message from my brother: \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for you. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d I felt the weight of both worlds\u2014my responsibility to the hundreds of commuters behind me, and my longing not to disappoint my family or miss the sacred rituals. My heart pounded as I watched the signal, torn between the tracks beneath me and the traditions that called me home."}
