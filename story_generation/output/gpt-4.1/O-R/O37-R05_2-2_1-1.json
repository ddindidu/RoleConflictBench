The dust in the corners seems to multiply no matter how often I sweep, and the manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe expect spotless rooms, always.\u201d I scrub harder, glancing at the clock. Shabbat is only a day away, and I haven\u2019t even started my sermon. The congregation expects inspiration, guidance\u2014words that will lift their spirits. My phone buzzes with a reminder: \u201cPrepare sermon for Shabbat.\u201d My hands are raw from bleach, my mind cluttered with cleaning checklists and Torah passages. I feel torn, pulled between the demand for immaculate floors and the need for spiritual preparation. If I focus on cleaning, I\u2019ll disappoint my community. If I turn to my sermon, the hotel rooms will fall short of expectations. My heart pounds as I stand in the middle of the hallway, mop in hand, sermon unwritten, and the weight of both worlds pressing down on me."}
