As a pharmacist, I knew how crucial it was to stay current\u2014patients depended on my knowledge, and my professional reputation rested on it. The workshop was intense, and by the afternoon break, my stomach rumbled. I glanced at the refreshment table: sandwiches, pastries, and snacks, all unmarked. I scanned for familiar kosher symbols, but found none. My colleagues urged me to join them, chatting and laughing as they filled their plates. I felt the weight of expectation\u2014networking was part of professional growth, and sharing a meal was a simple way to connect. Yet, as a Jew, I was committed to observing kosher laws, a daily practice that shaped my identity and faith. The kosher snacks I\u2019d packed were in my bag, but eating them apart from the group would set me apart, maybe even seem rude. I stood at the edge of the room, torn between blending in as a dedicated pharmacist and honoring my Jewish values, the tension tightening in my chest as I weighed what to do next."}
