As a construction laborer, I knew the rules: when the alarm sounds, you don\u2019t hesitate. You leave everything and head straight to the muster point, no questions asked. My foreman\u2019s eyes met mine, urging me to move, to be part of the team, to keep everyone safe.\n\nBut today was different. Today was the main weekly service at the chapel, the one I lead as the community\u2019s priest. The pews would be filling with people seeking comfort, guidance, and the prayers I promised to deliver. They counted on me to be there, to offer them hope and connection. My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014messages from parishioners asking if I was on my way.\n\nI stood frozen, torn between the blaring alarm and the silent pull of my congregation. The weight of both uniforms pressed on me, the hard hat and the collar, each demanding my presence, each with its own urgency. My hands trembled as I tried to decide which duty I would betray."}
