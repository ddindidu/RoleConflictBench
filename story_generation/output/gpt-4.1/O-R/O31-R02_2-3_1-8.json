As a police officer, I was expected to suit up, join my unit, and help keep the peace\u2014enforce the law, prevent violence, and protect everyone, no matter which side they stood on. My radio crackled with urgent updates: the crowd was swelling, tempers flaring. I felt the weight of my badge, the responsibility to act.\n\nBut my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was the Martinez family, their voices anxious. Their daughter\u2019s sacrament was tomorrow, and they needed me\u2014Father Michael\u2014to lead the final preparation session tonight. As their priest, I was supposed to guide them, offer comfort, and ensure their child was ready for this sacred step.
