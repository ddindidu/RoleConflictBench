My headset crackled with pilots\u2019 anxious voices as I tried to untangle the chaos from the sudden route closure. Every second, I calculated, recalculated, desperate to keep the airspace safe and efficient. The pressure was immense; one mistake could mean disaster. In the midst of this, my phone buzzed with a message: my close friend, working in another department, was being blamed for an error that wasn\u2019t theirs. I knew the truth, and as a Hindu, I felt the weight of dharma\u2014my duty to stand up for what\u2019s right, to speak out against injustice. But the airspace demanded my full attention. If I intervened now, even for a moment, I risked losing focus and endangering lives. My heart pounded as I wrestled with the impossible choice: uphold my professional responsibility, or honor my moral obligation to my friend. The demands of both roles pressed in, and I sat frozen, torn between the sky and my conscience, not knowing which duty to answer first."}
