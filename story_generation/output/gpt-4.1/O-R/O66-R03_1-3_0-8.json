She\u2019d mentioned her meeting wasn\u2019t for another hour, and the route was clear. As a taxi driver, I knew my job was to get her there safely and on time, but there was no rush. Yet, my mind kept drifting to the convent. The Mother Superior had just asked me to lead daily reflections for the retreat next week\u2014a great honor, but also a heavy responsibility. I was expected to spend these quiet moments in prayer and study, preparing my heart and words for the sisters who would look to me for guidance. Instead, I was behind the wheel, ferrying strangers through city streets, my Bible and notes untouched in the glove compartment. Guilt gnawed at me. Was I neglecting my spiritual duty for the sake of my job? Or was I serving in another way, offering kindness and safety to those who needed a ride? The city lights blurred as I wrestled with the expectations pulling me in two directions, unsure which path to follow."}
