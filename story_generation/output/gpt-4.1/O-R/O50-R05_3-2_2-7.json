My hands trembled as I grabbed my toolkit, knowing every second mattered. As I rushed down the corridor, my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a reminder that the bar mitzvah I was to officiate was about to begin. The family had been preparing for months, and their expectations weighed heavily on me. I could picture the boy, nervous and hopeful, waiting for me to guide him through this milestone. But the ICU doors loomed ahead, and I could hear the frantic voices of nurses calling for help.
