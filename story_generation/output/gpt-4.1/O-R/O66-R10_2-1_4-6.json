As a taxi driver, I knew I had to be extra careful\u2014other cars darted between lanes, their impatience making every intersection a gamble. My hands gripped the wheel tighter, eyes flicking between the mirrors and the road ahead, every muscle tense with the responsibility of getting my passenger home safely. \n\nThen, as I turned a corner, the familiar colors and sounds of a Hindu festival caught my attention. Bright marigold garlands, the scent of incense, and the distant rhythm of drums called to something deep within me. Today was an important day, and I was expected to join the community, to offer prayers and be present with my family. I slowed the car, torn between the urge to stop and the duty to my passenger and the rules of the road. My heart pounded with longing and guilt, caught between the pull of my faith and the demands of my job, the rain blurring the world outside as I wrestled with what to do next."}
