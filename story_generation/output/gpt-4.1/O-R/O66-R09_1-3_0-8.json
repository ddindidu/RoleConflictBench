My passenger, a young man in jeans and a hoodie, chatted on his phone about meeting friends for dinner. He had plenty of time, and the streets were clear. As I turned onto Main, my phone buzzed with a message from the synagogue: \u201cWe need one more for minyan\u2014funeral prayer at 6. Can you come?\u201d My heart thudded. I knew how important it was to help form the quorum, especially for a funeral prayer. It was a mitzvah, a sacred duty, and I could almost hear my father\u2019s voice urging me not to let the community down. But I was on the clock, responsible for getting my passenger to his destination safely and on time. He was relaxed, in no rush, but I couldn\u2019t just abandon my fare. My hands tightened on the steering wheel as I wrestled with the pull of my faith and the responsibility of my job, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
