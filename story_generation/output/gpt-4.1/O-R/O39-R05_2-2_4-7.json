My foreman\u2019s voice echoed in my head: \u201cKeep it safe, keep it clean.\u201d I knew if someone slipped, it\u2019d be on me. I reached for the mop, but my phone buzzed. It was the bar mitzvah coordinator. The family was already gathering at the synagogue, waiting for me to lead their son through the most important moment of his young life. I could picture their anxious faces, the boy clutching his Torah portion, the guests filling the sanctuary. My heart pounded. If I left now, the spill might go unattended, risking someone\u2019s safety. If I stayed to clean it, I\u2019d be late for the ceremony, letting down a family who\u2019d placed their trust in me as their rabbi. I stood frozen, mop in hand, torn between my duty to protect my coworkers and my responsibility to guide a child into adulthood."}
