The emergency motion for a temporary restraining order had just landed on my desk, the file thick with affidavits and urgent pleas. As a judge, I was expected to review every detail, to ensure justice was not rushed or compromised. The clock ticked loudly; I had less than an hour to read, analyze, and rule.\n\nMy phone buzzed. It was the parish secretary, reminding me that the Martinez family was waiting in the church hall. Their daughter\u2019s sacrament was tomorrow, and this final preparation session was not only mandatory but deeply meaningful to them. As their priest, I was expected to guide, teach, and be fully present for their spiritual journey.\n\nI stared at the legal documents, then at my notes for the class. My mind raced, torn between the demands of law and faith, justice and compassion. Both roles called for my undivided attention, both lives\u2014those in the courtroom and those in the church\u2014depended on me. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which duty to answer first, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds."}
