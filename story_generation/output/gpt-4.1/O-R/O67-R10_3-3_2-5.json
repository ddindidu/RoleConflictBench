My hands gripped the steering wheel, heart pounding as I prepared to speed through the city\u2019s tangled streets. As an ambulance driver, every second mattered; lives depended on my swift response. But as I turned onto the main road, I saw a police officer accepting a thick envelope from a man in a suit, right in front of a battered car. The driver, bloodied and dazed, was pleading for help, but the officer waved him off, pocketing the money. My upbringing as a Hindu echoed in my mind: dharma, righteousness, standing against injustice. I felt a surge of anger and helplessness. Should I stop, confront the officer, and try to help the injured man, fulfilling my moral duty? Or should I push on, racing to the highway where more lives hung in the balance, fulfilling my duty as an ambulance driver? The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding action, each impossible to ignore. My foot hovered over the brake, my mind torn, the siren wailing in my ears."}
