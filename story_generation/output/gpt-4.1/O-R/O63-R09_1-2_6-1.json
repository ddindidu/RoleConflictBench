The call volume is unusually light today, and my supervisor has already mentioned we can take our breaks whenever we want, as long as we don\u2019t all leave at once. I know I should use this time to rest my voice or grab a coffee, but my mind keeps drifting to home. The holiday is just days away, and I promised myself I\u2019d teach my kids the blessings before it arrives. They\u2019re counting on me to help them understand what it means to be Jewish, to pass on the words and the meaning behind them. \n\nBut here I am, headset still on, feeling the pull of two worlds. If I take my break now, I could call home and walk them through the prayers, maybe even hear them recite a few lines. But what if the call volume suddenly spikes? What if my supervisor notices I\u2019m gone longer than usual? I want to be the reliable employee, the one who follows the rules, but I also want to be the parent who keeps our traditions alive. My heart aches as I sit, torn between the demands of my job and the needs of my family, unsure which role to honor first."}
