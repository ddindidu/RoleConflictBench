My fingers hovered over the call list, heart pounding, knowing every sale counted. If I didn\u2019t close at least three more deals, not only would my bonus vanish, but the whole team would suffer penalties. Yet, as I prepared my pitch, my phone vibrated again\u2014this time, a message from Brother Yusuf, a devoted member of my congregation. He pleaded for a meeting, his words heavy with distress about his family. As an imam, I knew my duty was to offer him comfort and guidance, especially when he was most vulnerable. But the clock was ticking, and my manager\u2019s expectations pressed down on me. I stared at the two phones, feeling the weight of both worlds. My mind raced, torn between the urgent demands of my job and the sacred trust of my community. The pressure built inside me, a storm of guilt and responsibility, as I tried to decide which call to answer first."}
