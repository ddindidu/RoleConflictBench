My manager\u2019s words echo in my mind: \u201cWe need every sale today, or we all lose out.\u201d I know the pressure is on; my team is counting on me to make those calls, to push just a little harder, to meet the target. But outside my window, the faint sound of chanting drifts in from the monastery. Today is the festival, the one day each year when the whole community gathers before sunrise. I promised the monks I\u2019d help with the preparations, to serve tea and sweep the courtyard, to be present and mindful. My heart aches with the pull of both worlds\u2014one demanding relentless persuasion, the other quiet service. I stare at my headset, then at my saffron robe folded neatly on the chair. The expectations press in from both sides, and I feel myself caught in the tightening space between them, uncertain which path to follow as the sun rises."}
