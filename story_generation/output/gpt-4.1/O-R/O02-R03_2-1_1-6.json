The hush of the cloister was a balm, and I had looked forward all week to this quiet hour of spiritual reading and reflection. My heart longed for stillness, for the gentle voice of God in the silence. But my phone buzzed insistently, shattering the peace. It was a message from my project manager: the stakeholders needed a working prototype by tomorrow morning, or the project might lose funding. My mind raced with technical details\u2014circuit diagrams, code bugs, the unfinished interface. I could almost hear the anxious voices of my team, counting on me to deliver. Yet here, in this sacred space, I was expected to set aside worldly concerns, to be present with God, to nurture my soul. The demands of my two worlds pressed in on me, each urgent, each important. My hands trembled as I closed my Bible, torn between the call to serve through my engineering skills and the call to deepen my spiritual life."}
