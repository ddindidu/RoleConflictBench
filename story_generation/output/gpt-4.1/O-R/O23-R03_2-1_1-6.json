The filing deadline loomed, and I knew my clients depended on my careful analysis to protect their interests. Yet, as the clock ticked toward the quiet afternoon hours, I felt the weight of my other calling. The convent was silent, sunlight streaming through stained glass, inviting me to set aside worldly concerns and immerse myself in spiritual reading and reflection. My heart ached for the peace I always found in those moments of contemplation, the gentle rhythm of prayer and study that nourished my soul. But the legal documents on my desk were insistent, their urgency clashing with the stillness I craved. I felt torn, pulled between the demands of justice and the call to spiritual depth, wondering how I could possibly honor both without failing one."}
