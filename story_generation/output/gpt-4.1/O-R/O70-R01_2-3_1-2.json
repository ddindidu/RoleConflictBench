The groceries in the back seat were for Mrs. Lee, who had called twice already, her voice trembling with worry about her dinner guests. The app flashed a warning: \u201cDelivery window closing in 15 minutes.\u201d I pressed the gas a little harder, but my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from the church. Mark was waiting in my office, desperate for guidance. His text was raw: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. Please, I need you now.\u201d I could picture him, hands shaking, eyes searching for hope. My mind raced. As a delivery person, I was expected to be reliable, to keep promises, to make sure people like Mrs. Lee could count on me. But as a pastor, I was supposed to be present, to offer comfort when it mattered most. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I gripped the steering wheel, torn between the ticking clock and the silent cry for help, feeling the impossible pull of two worlds I cared about deeply."}
