The audit at work was coming up, and as the lead engineer, it was my responsibility to make sure every safety protocol was documented and up to date. My manager had made it clear\u2014no shortcuts, no oversights. We had plenty of time, but the expectation was perfection, and I felt the weight of that trust. At the same time, I had been asked to chant a Torah portion at synagogue this Shabbat. It was an honor, and my family was proud. The rabbi had reminded me how important it was to be present, to uphold our traditions, especially now. But the audit prep was demanding more hours, and I knew I\u2019d need to work late to get everything right. I could feel the tension building inside me\u2014my commitment to my team, my responsibility to my community, both pulling at me. I sat at my desk, the hum of the office around me, and wondered how I could possibly meet both expectations without letting someone down."}
