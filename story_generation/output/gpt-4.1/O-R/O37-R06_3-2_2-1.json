Curiosity got the better of me, and I peeked inside\u2014there was a gold bracelet, clearly valuable, and a folded note with a name I didn\u2019t recognize. My supervisor\u2019s voice echoed in my mind: \u201cDeep clean every room, check every corner, and report anything unusual.\u201d I knew I was supposed to hand over anything I found, no questions asked. But as a Christian, I remembered the teachings about honesty and doing what\u2019s right, not just what\u2019s required. What if this belonged to a guest who desperately needed it back? What if reporting it meant it would never be returned to its rightful owner? My hands trembled as I held the pouch, torn between following my job\u2019s strict protocol and listening to the quiet voice inside urging me to act with compassion and integrity. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I stood frozen, unsure which path to take."}
