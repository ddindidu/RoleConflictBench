Today was the day of a major Hindu festival, one my family had been preparing for weeks. My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, urging me to come early, to help with the offerings and join the prayers. But here I was, watching over the pool, knowing that every second mattered if someone needed help. Suddenly, I noticed a swimmer in the middle of the pool, their strokes faltering, head bobbing awkwardly. My heart pounded. I couldn\u2019t leave my post, not even for a moment, not when someone\u2019s safety depended on me. Yet, my phone buzzed with messages from my family, asking when I would arrive, reminding me of the rituals I was expected to lead. The weight of both worlds pressed down on me, each demanding my full presence, each unwilling to wait. I gripped the armrest, torn between the sacred call of my faith and the urgent responsibility of my job, feeling the tension coil tighter with every passing second."}
