As a pharmacist, I knew how important it was to stay updated\u2014patients depended on me for safe, accurate advice. But as the clock ticked past noon, my mind drifted to the small brass idol I kept at home, the incense I hadn\u2019t lit, the water I hadn\u2019t offered. My family expected me to practice our daily rituals, to honor the gods with devotion and time. Instead, I found myself quietly repeating a short mantra under my breath, hoping it would be enough. The workshop demanded my full attention, but my heart tugged me toward my faith. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, each expecting more than I could give. My hands fidgeted with my pen, torn between the duty to my patients and the duty to my beliefs, unsure which voice to answer first."}
