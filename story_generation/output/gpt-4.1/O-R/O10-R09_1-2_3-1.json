The tax law seminar was scheduled for Thursday afternoon\u2014right when I usually gather the kids to teach them the blessings for the upcoming holiday. As an accountant, I knew how crucial it was to stay ahead of regulatory changes; my clients depended on me to keep them compliant and informed. Missing the seminar could mean falling behind, risking mistakes that could cost them dearly.\n\nBut as a Jewish parent, I felt a different kind of responsibility. The holiday was just days away, and the children still stumbled over the blessings. Passing on our traditions wasn\u2019t just important\u2014it was sacred. If I skipped our lesson, would I be letting them down, letting our heritage slip a little further from their grasp?\n\nBoth roles pulled at me, each with its own weight of expectation. I could almost hear my clients\u2019 voices, anxious for guidance, and my children\u2019s, eager and trusting. The clock ticked on, and I sat there, torn, the demands of my two worlds pressing in from both sides."}
