She\u2019d been waiting for someone to talk to, and I knew how much these moments meant to her. As a nursing assistant, I was expected to offer more than just medical care\u2014I was supposed to be a companion, a source of comfort. She reached for my hand, her voice trembling as she spoke about her late husband and the loneliness that crept in during the afternoons. I sat beside her, listening, feeling the weight of her need for connection.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, my heart tightened. The main weekly service at the chapel was about to begin, and as the community\u2019s priest, I was expected to lead the prayers, to be present for everyone who looked to me for spiritual guidance. I could already imagine the congregation gathering, waiting for me to appear. Torn between staying with Mrs. Carter and fulfilling my duty to the community, I felt the pressure mounting inside me, each role pulling me in a different direction, both expecting my presence, both needing me now."}
