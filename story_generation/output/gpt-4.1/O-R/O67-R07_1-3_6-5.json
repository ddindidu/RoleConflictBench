My shift is almost over, and I\u2019m supposed to move the vehicle to the satellite station for the next crew. The radio crackles, but it\u2019s just routine chatter. My mind, though, is far from routine. In less than an hour, I\u2019m meant to lead the weekly meditation at the temple\u2014a responsibility I cherish as a practicing Buddhist. The group expects me to be calm, centered, and present, to guide them in mindfulness and stillness. But traffic is thick, and the clock on the dashboard ticks relentlessly forward. I feel the pressure to hurry, to make it in time, but I know the ambulance must be driven with care\u2014no rushing, no shortcuts. My heart pounds with the tension between my duty to safety and my commitment to spiritual practice. I can\u2019t be late, but I can\u2019t be reckless. The city blurs past, and I wrestle with the weight of both roles, torn between the demands of the world and the peace I\u2019m supposed to embody."}
