The project manager looked to me for time estimates on the new feature, and I knew my input would shape the next month\u2019s work. The session was informal, and the timeline wasn\u2019t set in stone, but my colleagues expected me to be thorough and realistic. As I listened, my mind kept drifting to my other responsibility\u2014preparing the Shabbat sermon. It was still weeks away, but I always started early, searching for inspiration and weaving together ideas that would resonate with my congregation. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. My team needed my focus now, but my community counted on me to bring depth and meaning to our services. I could feel the tension rising, torn between the immediate demands of engineering and the quiet, persistent call to begin my spiritual work."}
