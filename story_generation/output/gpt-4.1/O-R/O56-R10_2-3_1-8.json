I smiled, ready to greet her, to offer the warmth and reassurance every new client deserves. But my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from my family group chat. Today was the festival, the one I\u2019d promised to attend, the one that required my presence for the rituals and prayers. My mother\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, urging me not to miss the offerings, to honor our traditions. Yet here I was, scissors in hand, watching the client fidget with her purse, clearly needing comfort and attention. My heart tugged in two directions: the duty to my faith and family, and the responsibility to my client, who needed me to be present, welcoming, and calm. I stood frozen, the weight of both worlds pressing on my shoulders, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
