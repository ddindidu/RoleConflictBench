My client, Mrs. Evans, relied on me to keep her home spotless, and I knew she expected me to manage the supplies and let her know when something was running low. The next cleaning was in just a few days, and if I didn\u2019t say anything, she might not have time to buy more. But I also remembered how she\u2019d mentioned money was tight this month, and I could see the worry in her eyes when she talked about bills. As a Christian, I always tried to show kindness and understanding, just as Jesus taught\u2014to ease burdens, not add to them. I wanted to help her, maybe even buy the cleaner myself or find a way to stretch what was left. But I also had my job to do, and part of that was being honest and responsible about supplies. The weight of these two expectations pressed on me, and I stood there, mop in hand, torn between my duty as a cleaner and my calling to show compassion."}
