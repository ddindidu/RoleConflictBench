Children clustered near the curb, their laughter rising above the hum of engines. The construction detour had squeezed the lanes, and traffic was barely moving. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the most significant religious holiday service was about to begin. As a priest, my congregation expected me to lead them in prayer, to be present for the holiest day of the year. But as a taxi driver, I was responsible for every life around me, especially these children. The urge to speed up, to make it to the church on time, gnawed at me. Yet, the law and my conscience demanded caution. My heart pounded with the weight of both callings\u2014one pulling me to serve my faith community, the other to protect the innocent lives outside my window. I stared at the clock, torn between duty and devotion, knowing I could not fulfill both expectations at once."}
