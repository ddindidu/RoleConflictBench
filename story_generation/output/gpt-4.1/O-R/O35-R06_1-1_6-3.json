This morning, an email popped up from management\u2014an optional sign-up for a professional development seminar next month. They say it\u2019s not mandatory, but I know how these things go; those who show initiative are remembered. The seminar, of course, is on a Sunday. I glance at the calendar and feel a familiar pang. Sundays are for church, for worship and fellowship, for reconnecting with my faith and my community. I haven\u2019t been as regular lately, always telling myself I\u2019ll go when time allows, but the truth is, work keeps creeping in. My supervisor expects us to be proactive, to show commitment beyond the tracks. My pastor, and my own conscience, expect me to honor the Sabbath, to be present in the pews, not just in spirit. I stare at the email, cursor hovering over the RSVP button, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in, each demanding a piece of me I\u2019m not sure I can give."}
