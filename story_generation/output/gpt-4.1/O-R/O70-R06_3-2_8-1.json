She sounded upset, asking why her package hadn\u2019t arrived yet. I checked the tracking system and realized her order had been misplaced at the warehouse. My company expects me to handle these situations calmly and professionally, to reassure the customer and avoid blame. But as a Christian, I feel compelled to be honest, to admit the mistake and take responsibility, even if it means getting in trouble with my supervisor for not following the script. My heart pounded as I stared at the phone, torn between the company\u2019s demand for polished, careful communication and my own conviction to speak the truth with humility. I could already imagine my manager\u2019s disappointment if I confessed the error outright, but I also felt the weight of my faith urging me not to hide behind half-truths or excuses. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, caught between the expectations of my job and the values I hold most dear."}
