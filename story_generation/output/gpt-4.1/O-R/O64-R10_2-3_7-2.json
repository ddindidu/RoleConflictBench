As a cashier, I greet each customer with a smile, scanning items quickly, making small talk, and apologizing for the wait. My manager expects me to keep things moving and keep everyone happy. But as I glance at the clock, my heart pounds. It\u2019s almost time for my midday prayer, a sacred ritual I never miss. As a Hindu, I am expected to pause, chant, and make offerings at precise times, honoring my faith and my family\u2019s traditions. The minutes slip by, and I feel the weight of both worlds pressing on me. If I leave the register, I\u2019ll let down my team and the customers. If I stay, I\u2019ll break my spiritual discipline. My hands tremble as I hand back change, my mind torn between duty and devotion, wondering how I can possibly honor both."}
