The family ceremony was set to begin in less than an hour, and my mother had called twice already, reminding me to arrive on time, dressed in my best kurta. As a Hindu, these moments with family, especially during festivals, were sacred\u2014my presence was expected, almost demanded. Yet, here I was, standing beside a car parked illegally outside a busy temple. The driver, an elderly man, pleaded with me, explaining he was only inside for a few minutes to offer prayers. As a police officer, I was expected to act with integrity and fairness, upholding the law without bias. Issuing the ticket was the clear, correct action, but I knew I could apply discretion. My mind raced\u2014if I let him go, was I compromising my duty? If I ticketed him, was I being insensitive to the very traditions I cherished? The pressure of both uniforms\u2014my police blues and my ceremonial whites\u2014pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, torn between two worlds, unable to move."}
