My hands, rough from years of carpentry, gripped the broom as I swept the floor, careful to clear every stray nail and splinter. Safety was non-negotiable; I owed it to my crew to keep the site spotless, to prevent even the smallest accident. Yet, as I glanced at the clock, anxiety gnawed at me. The High Holiday was approaching, and I had yet to finish my sermon. The congregation expected inspiration, guidance\u2014words that would carry them through the year. My mind raced with unfinished thoughts, half-formed ideas, but my body remained rooted in the workshop, tethered by the responsibility to my team. The weight of both worlds pressed on me: the demand for a safe, orderly site and the spiritual needs of my community. I felt torn, heart pounding, as I tried to decide which duty to honor first, knowing that neglecting either would mean letting someone down."}
