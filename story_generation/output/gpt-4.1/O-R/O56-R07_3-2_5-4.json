I had been looking forward to the quiet, the gentle rhythm of breath, the release from the day\u2019s chatter. But just as I was sweeping up the last of the day\u2019s hair, Mrs. Chan stormed in, her voice sharp and trembling. \u201cThis cut is all wrong! Look at this!\u201d She jabbed at her reflection, her anger filling the small space. I could see the disappointment in her eyes, and I knew my duty as a hairdresser was to listen, to fix, to soothe.
