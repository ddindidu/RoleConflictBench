I knew the sound well\u2014if I didn\u2019t act now, the whole line could grind to a halt, costing hours and thousands. My supervisor\u2019s voice was still in my ear: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford downtime. You\u2019re the only one who can fix it.\u201d I wiped the sweat from my brow, glancing at my watch. In less than twenty minutes, I was supposed to be at the synagogue, leading Rivka through her final study session before her Beit Din. She\u2019d waited months for this, her questions growing deeper, her anticipation palpable. The community expected me to guide her, to ensure she was ready, to honor the sacred trust of teaching Torah. My toolbox felt heavy in my hand, but the weight in my chest was heavier. I could hear the children\u2019s laughter from the classroom down the hall, mingling with the metallic wail of the failing bearing. I stood frozen, torn between the urgent call of the machine and the sacred responsibility awaiting me at the synagogue, knowing that whichever path I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
