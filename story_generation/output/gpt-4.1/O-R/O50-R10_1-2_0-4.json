The plant was quiet\u2014production was slow, and this machine hadn\u2019t been used in weeks. My supervisor expected me to diagnose the glitch quickly, but the problem was elusive, appearing only now and then. I felt the pressure to fix it fast, to prove my worth as a reliable repairer.\n\nJust then, I overheard voices from the break room. My friend Ravi was being blamed for a mistake he didn\u2019t make. The accusation was unfair, and I could see the distress on his face. As a Hindu, I was taught to stand up for dharma\u2014for what is right\u2014even if it meant challenging authority. My heart pounded with the weight of responsibility: should I leave the machine and risk disappointing my supervisor, or should I intervene for my friend, upholding the values I hold dear? The demands of both roles pressed in on me, and I stood frozen, torn between duty and conscience."}
