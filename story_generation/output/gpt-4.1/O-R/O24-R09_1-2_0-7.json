As a judge, I am expected to review every case file thoroughly, no matter how routine the hearing may seem. The procedural hearing was in two weeks, but the file had just arrived, and I knew the court expected me to be prepared well in advance. Yet, as I glanced at my calendar, my heart tightened. This week, I was scheduled to chant a Torah portion at synagogue\u2014a commitment I had made months ago, one that my community and family expected me to honor. The preparation for chanting was not trivial; it required hours of practice and spiritual focus. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. The law demanded my diligence and impartiality, while my faith called for my presence and devotion. I could feel the tension building inside me, the sense that no matter how I divided my time, I would be letting someone down. I closed my eyes, wrestling with the impossible expectations, knowing a choice would have to be made."}
