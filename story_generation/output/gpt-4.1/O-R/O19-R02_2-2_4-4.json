Mrs. Lee stood before me, clutching her new prescription, her eyes anxious as she asked about side effects. I knew she needed careful counseling\u2014her medical history was complicated, and she trusted me to guide her safely. As I began to explain, my phone buzzed in my pocket. It was a reminder: Mr. Alvarez, a parishioner, was waiting at the church office. He\u2019d confided in me last Sunday about a struggle weighing on his soul, and today was the only time he could meet. My mind raced. As a pharmacist, I owed Mrs. Lee my full attention and expertise. As a priest, I was Mr. Alvarez\u2019s lifeline, expected to offer comfort and spiritual counsel. Both needed me, right now, in different ways. My heart pounded as I tried to focus on Mrs. Lee\u2019s questions, but guilt gnawed at me, knowing someone else was waiting for hope only I could offer."}
