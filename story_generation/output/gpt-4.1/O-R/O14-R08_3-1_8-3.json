The call from the lab startled me\u2014a critical piece of equipment was issuing warning alerts, and there was a real risk of hazardous leakage if it wasn\u2019t addressed immediately. As a scientist, I knew the protocols: I had to get there fast, check the system, and ensure everyone\u2019s safety. But as I rushed to grab my keys, I caught a glimpse of myself in the hallway mirror. My attire was far from the modest dress I always maintained outside the home as a Muslim. The lab was only a short drive away, but I\u2019d be seen by colleagues and possibly others. The urgency of the situation pressed on me, but so did the weight of my faith\u2019s expectations. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to protect the lab and those in it, and the commitment to uphold my values.
