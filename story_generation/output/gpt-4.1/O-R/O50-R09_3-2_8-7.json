The new staff hovered nearby, their faces tense as they prepared to start the next batch. I could see they were unsure, skipping steps in the safety checklist. My job demanded I guide them, make sure they understood the risks\u2014one wrong move and someone could get hurt. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: tonight was my turn to chant at synagogue, a commitment I\u2019d made weeks ago. The service would start in less than an hour, and I was expected to be there, to honor my faith and my community. My heart pounded as I weighed the responsibility to my clients against my promise to my congregation. Both roles pulled at me, each expecting my full presence, and I stood frozen, caught between the urgent need to protect these workers and the sacred duty waiting for me across town."}
