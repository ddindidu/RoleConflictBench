Most days, the calls were routine\u2014polite, sometimes even friendly, and the objections were ones I\u2019d practiced handling a hundred times. But today, my mind kept drifting to the devastation outside. The hurricane had torn through our town, leaving families without homes, and the mayor himself had come to our convent, pleading for help. As a nun, I was expected to lead the relief effort, to be present, comforting, and resourceful for those in need. Yet here I was, tethered to my headset, expected to meet my sales quota, to stay calm and persuasive, even as my heart ached to be out there, serving. Each ring of the phone felt heavier, each \u201cHow can I help you today?\u201d a reminder of the hands I wasn\u2019t holding, the meals I wasn\u2019t serving. The demands of my two worlds pressed in, and I felt myself pulled apart, uncertain which voice I should answer first."}
