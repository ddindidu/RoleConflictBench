The coppery highlights shimmered under the salon lights, but her lips pressed into a thin line as she studied her reflection. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit brighter than I expected,\u201d she said quietly, disappointment flickering in her eyes. My heart sank. As a hairdresser, I knew I should offer to adjust the colour, reassure her, and make sure she left happy. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the Buddhist study circle met in less than an hour, and tonight\u2019s chapter was one I hadn\u2019t read. I\u2019d promised myself to be present, to deepen my understanding, to honor my commitment to the sangha. Yet here I was, torn between the client\u2019s unspoken hope for my attention and my own longing for spiritual growth. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety twisting together. Could I stay late and fix her hair, risking missing the study? Or should I gently ask her to return another day, knowing she might leave dissatisfied? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I stood there, scissors in hand, caught between two worlds."}
