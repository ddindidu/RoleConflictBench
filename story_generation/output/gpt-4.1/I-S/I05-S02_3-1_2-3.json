My mentee, Sarah, was waiting for my feedback on her job offer\u2014a decision that could shape her entire career. She trusted me to provide clear, thoughtful guidance, and I knew she was anxious for my response. At the same time, my activist group\u2019s chat exploded with urgency: the petition to our state senator was closing in minutes, and my signature could help push our cause over the threshold. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in. Sarah needed my undivided attention, a careful review of her options, and a message that would reassure her. But the petition was a rare chance to make a real difference in policy, something I\u2019d fought for all year. My hands hovered over the keyboard, torn between drafting a detailed email to Sarah and clicking the link to sign the petition. The clock ticked, and my heart pounded as I wrestled with the demands of being both a mentor and an activist, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
