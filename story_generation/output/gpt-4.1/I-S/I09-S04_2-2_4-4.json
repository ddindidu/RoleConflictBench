The only window I have to grab it is now, before work, and I can\u2019t afford to miss my chance to vote. As I step into the hallway, my dog, Max, starts barking\u2014loud and insistent\u2014at the sound of Mrs. Patel unlocking her door across the hall. She glances at me, her lips pressed tight, and I remember the note she left last week about keeping the hallway peaceful, especially in the mornings. I feel the weight of her expectation: to be a good neighbor, to keep shared spaces calm. But I can\u2019t linger to soothe Max or wait for the hallway to clear; if I don\u2019t hurry, I\u2019ll miss my only shot to get my ID and fulfill my duty as a voter. My heart pounds as I wrestle with the urge to apologize and quiet Max, and the pressure to dash out and not lose my chance at the polls. I stand frozen, torn between the hallway and the door, feeling the pull of both roles, unsure which to honor first."}
