My heart dropped\u2014my careless joke at lunch had clearly cut deeper than I realized. I knew I had to call Jamie right away, to apologize, to explain, to be the friend I promised I\u2019d always be. But just as I reached for my phone, the building\u2019s emergency alarms blared, and a neighbor pounded on my door. \u201cFlash flood! We need everyone\u2019s help to sandbag the entrance!\u201d I looked out the window; water was already pooling in the street. As a citizen, I knew I was needed\u2014my community depended on everyone pitching in during emergencies like this. But Jamie\u2019s pain was urgent too, and I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of letting our friendship fester another minute. My hands shook as I stood in the hallway, torn between dialing Jamie\u2019s number and rushing downstairs to help. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, each demanding my immediate attention, and I felt paralyzed, caught between being the friend Jamie needed and the citizen my neighbors counted on."}
