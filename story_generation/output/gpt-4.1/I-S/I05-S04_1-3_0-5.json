She looked at me, eyes wide, clearly hoping for some guidance. I glanced at the clock\u20146:30 p.m. The polling station would close at 7, and I still needed to rush home to grab my ID. I knew this was my only chance to vote, and I\u2019d been reminding myself for weeks not to forget. But Maya\u2019s uncertainty tugged at me; she rarely asked for help, and I could see how much this meant to her. As a mentor, I wanted to be present, to listen, to help her weigh her options. As a citizen, I felt the pressure to fulfill my civic duty, to show up with my ID and cast my ballot. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to guide Maya in a pivotal moment and the obligation to participate in the election. I could feel the minutes slipping away, my heart pounding as I tried to decide which role to honor."}
