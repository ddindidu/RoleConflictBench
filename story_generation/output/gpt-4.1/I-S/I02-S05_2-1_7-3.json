We\u2019d argued three times this week about money\u2014her frustration simmering just beneath every word. As her boyfriend, I knew I should be the one to smooth things over, to listen, to help us find common ground. But right now, I was also an advocate, about to represent a client in a minor hearing. The stakes weren\u2019t high, but my client still expected my full attention and best effort. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me: Mia needed reassurance and resolution, my client needed focus and competence. My mind raced with what I should say to Mia, how I could make things right, but I also needed to review my notes and prepare for court. My heart pounded, torn between the urge to call her and the duty to walk into that courtroom. I stared at my phone, then at the courthouse steps, caught in the impossible space between the two people who needed me most."}
