It was Jamie, my closest friend, sending a string of messages about how drained and lonely she felt after a long, uneventful day at work. I could almost hear her sighs through the screen, and I knew she needed someone to listen, to remind her she mattered. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014we show up, even if it\u2019s just through a phone call or a few thoughtful replies.\n\nBut the clock was ticking. The polling station was open all day, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote before dinner. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I felt a responsibility to participate, to make my voice heard. I kept glancing at the time, torn between the duty I owed my community and the comfort I owed my friend. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, unsure whether to call Jamie and risk running late, or to send a quick reply and head out, hoping she\u2019d understand. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
