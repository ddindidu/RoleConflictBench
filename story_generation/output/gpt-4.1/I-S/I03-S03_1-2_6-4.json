He thought I\u2019d agreed to spend Saturday with his friends, but I\u2019d already promised my mom I\u2019d help her with errands. The misunderstanding was small, but I could sense his frustration in the short replies. As his girlfriend, I knew I should call him, talk it out, and clear the air before it grew into something bigger. That\u2019s what a good partner does\u2014resolves conflicts, doesn\u2019t let them fester.\n\nBut my laptop chimed with a reminder: the online candidate forum for our district was starting. I\u2019d been looking forward to it all week, determined to stay informed and participate as a responsible citizen. I wanted to listen, ask questions, maybe even submit feedback. It felt important, especially with the election coming up.\n\nI felt torn, my thumb hovering over the call button while the forum\u2019s live chat scrolled by. Alex needed me now, but so did my community. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014be present for my relationship, or fulfill my civic duty. I sat frozen, caught between two worlds, unsure which to choose."}
