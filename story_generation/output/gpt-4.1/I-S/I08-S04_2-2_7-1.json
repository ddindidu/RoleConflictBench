The polling station would close in less than two hours, and I still had groceries to put away. As I hurried through the store, I ran into Mark, an acquaintance from work. He smiled, but his tone quickly shifted as he leaned in, whispering, \u201cDid you hear about Jenna\u2019s latest project? Total disaster. I don\u2019t know how she keeps her job.\u201d \n\nI felt a knot tighten in my stomach. I\u2019d always believed in not speaking ill of others, especially when they weren\u2019t around to defend themselves. Mark clearly expected me to join in, to nod or add my own criticism. But I also knew I couldn\u2019t linger\u2014I had to get home and then rush to the polling station if I wanted my vote to count. \n\nCaught between the urge to politely steer the conversation away from gossip and the need to excuse myself quickly, I felt my heart race. I didn\u2019t want to seem rude or complicit, but the minutes were slipping away, and the weight of both roles pressed down on me."}
