We\u2019d argued again tonight\u2014this time about our shared expenses, the way money seemed to slip through our fingers. He wanted to talk, to resolve things before bed, but my laptop screen glared with the unfinished brief for tomorrow\u2019s hearing. My client\u2019s case was complicated, the stakes high, and I knew I needed every ounce of focus to represent them well. But Alex\u2019s words echoed in my mind, his frustration and hurt clear. As a girlfriend, I was supposed to help us work through these conflicts, to listen and reassure him. As an advocate, I was expected to be sharp, prepared, and unwavering for my client. The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding my full attention, each pulling me in opposite directions. My heart ached with the fear of letting someone down, and I stared at the phone, torn between the person I loved and the person who depended on my expertise."}
