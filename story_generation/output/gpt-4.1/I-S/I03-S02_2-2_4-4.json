My boyfriend is in the kitchen, setting out the takeout containers we picked up for our one open night together before I leave for a week of travel. He\u2019s been looking forward to this\u2014just us, no distractions, a rare pause in our hectic lives. I promised him my full attention tonight. My phone buzzes, and I see the name of the legislative aide flash across the screen. My heart jumps. This is the call I\u2019ve been waiting for\u2014the chance to make a real impact on the bill I\u2019ve poured months of energy into. The aide only has ten minutes, right now, and I know how crucial this conversation could be. I look at my boyfriend, his face expectant, and then at my phone, my mind racing. The demands of both worlds crash together inside me, and I feel the tension coil in my chest. I want to be present for him, to keep my promise, but I also can\u2019t ignore the responsibility I feel to the cause and the people counting on me. My hand hovers over the phone, torn between two parts of myself."}
