My mentee, Sarah, sat across from me, her hands trembling as she rehearsed her pitch for the biggest project of her young career. She needed reassurance, guidance\u2014someone to believe in her when she barely believed in herself. As her mentor, I was supposed to be that person, to help her grow, to be present in this crucial moment. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session for my client was in thirty minutes, across town. As their advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable; my client\u2019s future depended on my presence and preparation. I could see the hope in Sarah\u2019s eyes, the silent plea for just a few more minutes of support. At the same time, I felt the weight of my client\u2019s trust, the expectation that I would fight for them without fail. My mind raced, torn between two people counting on me, each in a moment that could change everything. I felt the pressure building, the impossible choice looming, and I sat frozen, caught between the roles that defined me."}
