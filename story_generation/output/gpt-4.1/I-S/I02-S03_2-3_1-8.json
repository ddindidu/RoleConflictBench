She read the message, her face falling. \u201cThey said my project isn\u2019t good enough,\u201d she whispered, eyes brimming with tears. I reached for her hand, wanting to be the anchor she needed, to listen and reassure her that she was more than her boss\u2019s opinion. But before I could say anything, the building\u2019s alarm blared, and a robotic voice announced a flash-flood warning. I glanced out the window\u2014water was already pooling in the street, creeping up the sidewalk. My phone buzzed with an emergency alert: residents were urged to help neighbors evacuate and check on the elderly. I felt torn in two. Mia\u2019s shoulders shook beside me, needing comfort and my full attention. But as a citizen, I knew I should be out there, helping others, doing my part for the community. My heart pounded as I looked from Mia\u2019s tear-streaked face to the rising water outside, caught between the person she needed and the citizen my city expected me to be."}
