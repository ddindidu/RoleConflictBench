My colleagues were dissecting every detail of our mutual friend Mark\u2019s recent decisions at work. As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossiping or speaking negatively about others, but the group\u2019s expectation was clear\u2014they wanted me to join in, to share my own opinions. My phone buzzed with a reminder: today was the last day to vote. I rushed to the polling station, only to be told by the official that my registration had a mismatch. As a voter, I was expected to follow all instructions, and the official explained I had to fill out a provisional ballot form before the station closed in ten minutes. My mind raced. If I stayed to finish the ballot, I\u2019d be late returning to work, where my absence would be noticed and might fuel more gossip. If I left, I\u2019d miss my chance to vote. The pressure from both roles pressed in on me, and I felt torn, caught between the demands of being a good acquaintance and a responsible voter, unsure which expectation I should meet."}
