The polling station would close in ten minutes, and I couldn\u2019t miss my chance to vote. As I rounded the corner, I saw Jamie, someone I knew from work, sitting on a bench with her head in her hands, shoulders shaking. I hesitated, torn. As an acquaintance, I felt I should stop, offer comfort, and be the friendly face she might need right now. But the clock was ticking, and as a voter, I had a civic duty to fulfill\u2014one that could only be done in the next few minutes. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between the urge to sit beside Jamie and the pressure to keep moving toward the polling station. I could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
