Bad day at work. Need you.\u201d I know she\u2019s been struggling with her new boss, and I promised I\u2019d always be there for her. But my laptop screen is filled with legal documents\u2014my client\u2019s case just took a complicated turn, and they\u2019re waiting for my advice before tomorrow\u2019s hearing. I can\u2019t let them down; they\u2019re counting on my expertise and clarity. Yet, Maya\u2019s voice on the phone is shaky, and I can almost feel her tears.
