My mentor had squeezed me in for a session just before catching a long flight, and I knew how precious her time was. She\u2019d made it clear: \u201cLet\u2019s make the most of this hour.\u201d I wanted to show her I respected her effort, that I valued every minute she gave me. But as I sipped my coffee, my mind kept drifting to the voter ID I\u2019d left at home. Today was the only morning I could pick it up before the polls closed tomorrow. If I missed this window, I might not be able to vote at all. The weight of civic duty pressed on me\u2014being a responsible citizen mattered, too. My mentor\u2019s text pinged: \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d My heart pounded. Should I dash home for my ID and risk being late, disrespecting her time? Or should I stay, honor my commitment as a mentee, and hope I could somehow vote later? The two roles tugged at me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
