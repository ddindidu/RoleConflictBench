It was Jamie, my closest friend. Her voice trembled, and I could hear her sniffling. \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now,\u201d she said, her words heavy with emotion. I knew she\u2019d had a rough week, and I wanted nothing more than to listen, to be there for her like she\u2019d always been for me. But I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift at the community center started in fifteen minutes, and I was the only one with the keys. People would already be waiting outside, counting on me to open up and start the day\u2019s service. My heart pounded as I tried to split myself in two, torn between the friend Jamie needed and the volunteer everyone else was depending on. I could hear the desperation in her voice, but I also pictured the line forming at the center, people growing anxious in the morning chill. I gripped my phone, caught in the impossible space between two promises, unsure which one I was about to break."}
