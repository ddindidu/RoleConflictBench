The line barely moves. My phone buzzes\u2014it's a message from Sam, my closest friend. \u201cHey, I\u2019m at the park entrance, but I don\u2019t see you. Are you here?\u201d I realize with a jolt that we\u2019d never confirmed which entrance to meet at. Sam\u2019s been upset with me lately, saying I\u2019m distant, and I promised I\u2019d be there for him tonight. I know if I don\u2019t reply now, he\u2019ll think I\u2019m blowing him off again. But the poll worker is already checking IDs, and there\u2019s a sign: \u201cNo phones beyond this point.\u201d If I step out to text Sam, I\u2019ll lose my place and my chance to vote. If I stay, I risk hurting my friend even more. My thumb hovers over my phone, torn between the duty to my friend and my responsibility as a voter, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
