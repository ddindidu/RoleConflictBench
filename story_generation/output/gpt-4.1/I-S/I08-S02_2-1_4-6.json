It was Sam, an old classmate I hadn\u2019t seen in months. \u201cHey, could you help me move some boxes this afternoon? I\u2019m really stuck.\u201d I glanced at the post again; thousands of people were reading it, and I knew that if I added a clear, informative comment now, it could make a real difference. But Sam sounded desperate, and I remembered how we\u2019d always promised to help each other out.
