He leaned in, lowering his voice. \u201cDid you hear about Jenna\u2019s latest case? She completely botched the filing. I don\u2019t know how she\u2019s still here.\u201d I felt a familiar discomfort. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t encourage gossip or speak ill of others, especially when I barely knew the full story. But as an advocate, Jenna was my client, and her case was on my desk. I was expected to represent her interests fiercely, to scrutinize every detail and, if necessary, acknowledge any missteps in her previous filings to build a stronger argument. Mark\u2019s words echoed in my mind, feeding doubts about Jenna\u2019s competence, but I also felt a surge of protectiveness. I was torn\u2014should I defend Jenna against Mark\u2019s criticism, risking the appearance of bias, or remain silent and let the negativity fester? My roles pulled me in opposite directions, and I could feel the tension tightening in my chest as I weighed my next words."}
