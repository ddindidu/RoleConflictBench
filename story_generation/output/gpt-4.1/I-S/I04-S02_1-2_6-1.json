I glance down and see a message from Jamie\u2014she\u2019s confused about where we\u2019re supposed to meet later. I know she\u2019s been feeling distant lately, and I promised I\u2019d be there for her, to talk things through and clear the air. I can\u2019t just leave her hanging, not when she\u2019s finally reaching out. But then I hear my name called from the front of the march. The organizers are waving me over, reminding me that I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant, to set the tone for the whole demonstration. People are counting on me to be present, to help amplify our cause. My thumb hovers over my phone, torn between sending Jamie a quick message and stepping up to the megaphone. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I feel my heart race as I try to decide which role I can\u2019t let down."}
