We\u2019d been talking about a movie night, maybe even trying that new restaurant downtown. He kept texting me ideas, and I could feel his excitement through the screen. I wanted to make it special, to show him how much I value our time together. But then, I saw the flyer for the free vaccine clinic at the community center. They needed volunteers, and I knew how important it was, especially with flu season coming up. As a citizen, I always try to do my part\u2014paying taxes on time, following health guidelines, and helping out when I can. The clinic was only running this weekend, right when we\u2019d planned our date. I felt torn. My boyfriend expected me to be present, to make memories with him. But my sense of responsibility to my community was just as strong. The thought of letting either side down made my stomach twist. I sat on my bed, phone in hand, wrestling with what to do next."}
