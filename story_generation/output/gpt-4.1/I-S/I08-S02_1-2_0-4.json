I glanced at the screen\u2014an unknown number, but I recognized the area code. It had to be the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks. My heart pounded; this was my chance to push for the bill I\u2019d poured so much energy into. Just as I was about to answer, I saw Jamie, an old classmate, coming toward me. Jamie smiled, clearly expecting a friendly hello, maybe even a quick chat. I knew Jamie had always found me approachable, someone who never brushed people off. But the phone kept buzzing, and I knew the aide would only be available for a few minutes. I felt torn, caught between the urge to maintain my reputation as a warm acquaintance and the pressing responsibility to seize this rare activist opportunity. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety twisting together as I tried to decide which role I owed more in this moment."}
