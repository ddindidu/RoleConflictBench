She was clear: this needs to be perfect and on her desk before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation. My phone buzzes again\u2014messages from my activist group. The protest march is starting in minutes, and I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant. They\u2019re counting on me to set the tone, to show up as I always do. My mentor\u2019s words echo in my mind, her trust in me heavy on my shoulders. But the cause I believe in, the people waiting for me outside, their hope is just as real. I feel my chest tighten, torn between the quiet responsibility of my mentee role and the urgent, pulsing call of activism. Both sides expect my full presence, my commitment. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both places need me now. My hands tremble as I hover over the keyboard, the sounds of the gathering crowd drifting through my window, the weight of expectation pressing in from every direction."}
