My mentee, Sarah, was waiting for our session\u2014she was on the verge of a big promotion, and I knew how much this meant to her. As her mentor, I wanted to give her my full attention, to help her navigate the tricky questions and boost her confidence. But my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: an urgent directive had just come in. All volunteers were required to follow new procedures immediately, or the service we provided would be suspended. The coordinator\u2019s words were clear\u2014no exceptions, no delays.\n\nI felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Sarah needed me to be present, to encourage her growth and help her seize this opportunity. But as a volunteer, I was expected to drop everything and comply with the coordinator\u2019s instructions, for the sake of everyone who depended on our service. My mind raced, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to Sarah and the responsibility I held as a volunteer. I stared at my phone, heart pounding, caught between two worlds that suddenly seemed impossible to reconcile."}
