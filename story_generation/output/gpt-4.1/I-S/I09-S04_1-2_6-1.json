She\u2019s flustered\u2014her shift at the hospital runs late, and she\u2019s expecting a package. \u201cCould you please keep an eye out for it?\u201d she asks. I\u2019ve done this before; it\u2019s what good neighbors do. I agree, but as she leaves, I glance at the clock. I still need to run errands, and today is election day. The polling station closes at seven, and I promised myself I\u2019d vote. The hours are slipping away. If I leave to vote and run errands, I might miss the delivery for Mrs. Patel. If I stay, I risk not making it to the polls in time. My mind races with guilt and responsibility\u2014am I a better neighbor if I help her, or a better citizen if I vote? The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I stand in my hallway, keys in hand, torn between the front door and my civic duty."}
