I glanced at the screen\u2014my friend, Sam, was calling. I knew he\u2019d just moved into his new apartment and was struggling with a mountain of flat-pack furniture. He texted, \u201cCan you hop on a quick video call? These instructions are impossible.\u201d I could almost hear the frustration in his words. As his friend, I wanted to be there for him, especially since he\u2019d helped me out so many times before.\n\nBut I was still at the center, and the volunteer coordinator had just reminded us about confidentiality. Even though my shift was winding down and the room was empty, I worried about the possibility of someone overhearing or catching a glimpse of confidential files in the background. I knew I shouldn\u2019t risk it, even if Sam\u2019s request seemed harmless. My mind raced\u2014should I step outside and call him, or would that look suspicious? I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, unsure which expectation I should honor in this moment."}
