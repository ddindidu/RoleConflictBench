My phone buzzed with a message from Maya, my mentee. She\u2019d missed another internal deadline, and her note was apologetic, full of stress. As her mentor, I was supposed to help her grow, to encourage her to find balance and develop the skills she needed. I wanted to set aside time to talk her through strategies, maybe even lighten her load for a week.\n\nBut as an advocate, my client\u2019s case was at a critical juncture. Every detail mattered, and I was expected to be fully prepared, to represent them with unwavering focus.
