It was Priya, an old acquaintance from college, asking if I could recommend a good restaurant nearby for her anniversary dinner. She sounded excited and a little anxious, wanting everything to be perfect. I glanced at the clock\u2014if I stopped to chat and give her thoughtful suggestions, I\u2019d be late for the meeting, something my colleagues and clients frowned upon. As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable; missing even a routine session could mean letting someone down or appearing unprofessional. But as an acquaintance, I felt a tug of responsibility to help Priya, especially since she rarely reached out. My mind raced, torn between the urge to support her and the pressure to uphold my professional commitments. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, phone in hand, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
