Today, my mentee, Sarah, was counting on me. She had a big interview coming up, and we\u2019d scheduled a crucial prep session before her final round. As her mentor, I knew how much she relied on my guidance, especially now. I wanted to be fully present, to help her grow and seize this opportunity.\n\nBut as I sipped my coffee, I remembered the email from the election board: I needed to bring my valid ID to vote, and I\u2019d left it at home. Today was my only window to pick it up, since tomorrow I\u2019d be at work all day and the polls would close before I could get there. The pressure mounted\u2014civic duty on one side, Sarah\u2019s future on the other.\n\nI felt torn. If I left to get my ID, I\u2019d miss our session or be distracted, letting Sarah down. If I stayed, I risked losing my chance to vote, something I deeply valued. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I sat at my desk, heart pounding, unable to decide which role to honor."}
