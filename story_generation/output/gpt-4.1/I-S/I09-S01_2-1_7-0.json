I glanced at the clock; my volunteer shift at the shelter started in an hour. I\u2019d always prided myself on being reliable, showing up on time, ready to help. But as I zipped up my jacket, I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor. She lived alone, and last winter she\u2019d slipped on the stairs during a blackout. I knew she\u2019d be anxious tonight, maybe even in need of help if the power went out. \n\nI hesitated in the hallway, keys in hand. If I stopped to check on Mrs. Lee, I\u2019d be late for my shift. The shelter could manage without me for a bit\u2014there were plenty of volunteers tonight\u2014but I hated the idea of letting the team down. Still, the thought of Mrs. Lee sitting in the dark, maybe scared or needing something, tugged at me. I stood there, torn, the storm already howling outside, feeling the weight of both responsibilities pressing in on me."}
