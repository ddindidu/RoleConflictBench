I glanced at the clock, knowing I had to leave soon for my volunteer shift at the shelter. I was the only one with the keys, and people would be waiting outside in the cold if I was late. But then I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor who lived alone just down the hall. She always waved when we passed, and last winter I\u2019d promised to check on her during emergencies. I could already imagine her worrying about the power going out or needing help with something simple, like moving a flashlight closer. My phone buzzed with a reminder for my shift, and I felt my chest tighten. If I stopped to check on Mrs. Lee, I might delay opening the shelter. If I left right away, I\u2019d be on time, but I\u2019d break my promise as a neighbor. The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between two places I needed to be."}
