I replay my careless words at lunch, realizing how they must have sounded. I know I need to call Sam right now, to explain, to apologize, to be the friend I promised I\u2019d always be\u2014honest, open, never letting misunderstandings fester. But as I reach for my phone, I glance at the clock. The polls close in thirty minutes, and this is my only chance to vote. My ID is buried somewhere in my bag, and the polling station is a fifteen-minute walk away. If I don\u2019t go now, I lose my voice in this election, something I\u2019ve always believed is my duty as a citizen. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between dialing Sam\u2019s number and grabbing my ID. I can\u2019t do both. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I feel paralyzed, caught between being the friend Sam needs and the voter I promised myself I\u2019d be."}
