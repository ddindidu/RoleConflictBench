My shoes are already on, keys in hand, but then I hear the front door creak. My boyfriend walks in, shoulders slumped, eyes red. He barely manages a weak smile before sinking onto the couch. \u201cBad day?\u201d I ask, already knowing the answer. He nods, voice trembling as he tells me about the harsh feedback he got at work, how it made him doubt himself. I want to sit beside him, hold his hand, and remind him how much he means to me. But the clock ticks louder in my mind. If I don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019ll miss my chance to vote\u2014something I\u2019ve promised myself and my community I\u2019d do. My heart aches as I stand in the hallway, torn between comforting the person I love and fulfilling my civic duty. I can\u2019t do both. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I feel paralyzed, wishing I could split myself in two."}
