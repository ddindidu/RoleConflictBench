She barely looks up as I set my bag down. \u201cIt was awful,\u201d she whispers, voice cracking. I know she needs me\u2014needs my arms around her, my words to remind her she\u2019s more than her boss\u2019s criticism. I want to sit beside her, listen, and help her feel safe again.\n\nBut my phone buzzes with a message from the activist group: the vote is happening now, earlier than expected. The bill we\u2019ve worked on for months hangs in the balance, and the undecided representative is taking calls for the next thirty minutes. If I don\u2019t reach out, we could lose everything we\u2019ve fought for. My heart pounds as I look from Maya to my phone, torn between the person I love and the cause I believe in. Both need me, right now, and I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
