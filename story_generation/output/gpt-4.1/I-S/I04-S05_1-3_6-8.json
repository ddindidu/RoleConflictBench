I glanced at the screen\u2014my friend, Sam, had messaged again, clearly confused about where we were supposed to meet for lunch. We\u2019d had a falling out last week, and I\u2019d promised to clear things up today. I knew how much it meant to Sam that I communicate openly and help resolve our misunderstanding. But as I typed out a quick reply, my watch vibrated with a reminder: the hearing was in ten minutes, and my client\u2019s future depended on my punctuality. The courthouse was just across the street, but if I stopped to clarify things with Sam now, I risked being late. If I ignored Sam, I\u2019d be letting down a friend who needed me. My heart pounded as I stood on the sidewalk, torn between the urgent demands of friendship and my responsibility as an advocate."}
