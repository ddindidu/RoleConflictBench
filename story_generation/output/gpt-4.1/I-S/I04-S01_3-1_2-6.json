It was Mia, her voice trembling as she told me her father had been rushed to the hospital. I sat up, heart pounding, listening as she sobbed, desperate for comfort. I knew she needed me to be present, to listen, to reassure her that she wasn\u2019t alone. But as I tried to focus on her words, my mind kept drifting to the email I\u2019d read before bed. The volunteer coordinator had asked if I could reorganize the supply closet at the shelter before the morning shift\u2014something about making it easier for the early crew. She\u2019d said it wasn\u2019t urgent, but I knew she\u2019d appreciate it if I got it done. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me. Mia needed my full attention, but I also didn\u2019t want to let down the coordinator or the team. I clutched the phone tighter, trying to sound calm for Mia, while my thoughts raced between her pain and the looming responsibility waiting for me at dawn."}
