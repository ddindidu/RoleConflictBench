The assignment was detailed and urgent\u2014she needed my analysis by morning, before upper management\u2019s evaluation. I could almost hear her voice, calm but firm, reminding me how important it was to meet deadlines and show initiative. My laptop pinged with a message from the volunteer coordinator: a reminder about the new safety steps we\u2019d discussed at the last briefing. \u201cEveryone must apply them consistently,\u201d she\u2019d said, \u201cespecially during tomorrow\u2019s early shift.\u201d I was scheduled to help set up at the community center at 7 a.m., and I knew how much they relied on me to set a good example. My mind raced, torn between the pressure to impress my mentor and the responsibility to my fellow volunteers. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My hands hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I tried to figure out how I could possibly meet both expectations without letting someone down."}
