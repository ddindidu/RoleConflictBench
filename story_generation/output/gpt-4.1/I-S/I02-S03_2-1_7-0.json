We\u2019ve argued all week about money\u2014her frustration with my spending, my defensiveness, both of us tired. I want to fix things, to show her I care, to be the boyfriend who listens and resolves conflicts, not the one who lets them fester. As we pass a bench, she unwraps a snack, crumples the wrapper, and, with a sigh, tosses it toward the grass. It lands just shy of the trash bin, right beneath a bright NO LITTERING sign. She keeps walking, eyes on the path, waiting for me to say something, maybe to let it go for the sake of peace. But as a citizen, I feel the weight of those words\u2014respect others, follow the rules. I glance at the wrapper, then at Mia\u2019s tense shoulders. My heart pounds. If I pick it up, will she see it as criticism, another argument? If I ignore it, am I betraying what I believe is right? The park is quiet, but inside, I\u2019m caught in a storm, torn between the man she needs and the citizen I want to be."}
