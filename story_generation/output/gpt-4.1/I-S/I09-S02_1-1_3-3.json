As a neighbor, I always tried to be considerate\u2014never overfilling, never leaving a mess, always making sure the lids closed tight so nothing would blow into Mrs. Lee\u2019s yard. I knew some people would wait until the bins were full to save space on the curb, but tomorrow was pickup day, and I didn\u2019t want to inconvenience anyone by dragging them out too late.\n\nJust as I reached for the handle, my phone buzzed. It was a reminder from the activist group I\u2019d joined: the online petition to our state senator was closing in minutes. They needed every signature to push for stricter recycling laws. I\u2019d promised to be more involved, to show up, to make my voice count. But if I stopped to sign now, I might miss the window to get the bins out before dark, and I knew my neighbor hated when I left them out overnight.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting\u2014my responsibility to my neighbors pulling me one way, my commitment to the cause tugging me the other. My thumb hovered over my phone as I glanced at the bins, heart pounding, caught between two worlds."}
