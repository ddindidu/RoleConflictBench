No exceptions. Service will be suspended if not done by tonight.\u201d I stared at the screen, heart pounding, knowing how crucial this was for the people we serve. But then, another notification popped up\u2014a text from my friend, short and cold: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that.\u201d My stomach twisted. I\u2019d made a careless joke earlier, and now I realized how much it hurt them. I knew I needed to call, to explain, to apologize before the misunderstanding grew. But the coordinator\u2019s words echoed in my mind\u2014no exceptions. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. My friend needed me to be honest and present, but the organization needed me to act, right now, or risk everything we\u2019d worked for. I stared at my phone, caught between dialing my friend\u2019s number and opening the volunteer guidelines, my hands trembling as I tried to decide which role to answer first."}
