It was Alex, my boyfriend, texting again. He\u2019d lost his sister just two days ago, and I\u2019d promised to be there for him, to hold his hand through every wave of grief. But today was election day, and I\u2019d already waited forty minutes in line. Suddenly, an official called out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line.\u201d My last name was Bennett. The new line was longer, slower, but the official\u2019s voice was firm\u2014this was the rule.\n\nAlex\u2019s messages grew more desperate: \u201cCan you come home soon? I really need you.\u201d I felt torn in two. As a girlfriend, I wanted to drop everything and rush to him, to be the comfort he needed. But as a voter, I was expected to follow the officials\u2019 instructions, to do my civic duty properly. My heart pounded as I shuffled toward the new line, guilt and frustration twisting inside me. I couldn\u2019t be in two places at once, and both roles demanded all of me."}
