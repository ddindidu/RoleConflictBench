As her mentor, I felt the weight of responsibility to guide her, to help her find strategies for better time management and encourage her to prioritize her well-being. I wanted to give her my full attention, to listen deeply and offer thoughtful advice. But as she spoke, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the city\u2019s bus route survey was closing soon. As a citizen, I knew how important it was to participate, to give feedback that could improve public transportation for everyone. The city counted on people like me to be engaged, to help shape our community. I felt torn\u2014Maya needed me now, but so did my city. My mind raced, guilt creeping in as I weighed the expectations of being a supportive mentor against my duty as an active citizen. I tried to focus on Maya\u2019s words, but the survey deadline loomed in the back of my mind, and I felt the tension rising inside me, unsure which role to honor in this moment."}
