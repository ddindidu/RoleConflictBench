Mrs. Lee from next door shot me a tired look, and I felt the weight of her unspoken expectation: keep the noise down, respect our shared space. I mumbled an apology, tugging my dog back inside, heart pounding with embarrassment. Just as I closed the door, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder from my activist group. The online petition to strengthen animal welfare laws was about to be sent to our local legislator, and I had one last chance to add my name. My activist side screamed that I couldn\u2019t miss this opportunity to make a difference. But I hesitated, thinking of Mrs. Lee and the other neighbors who already seemed frustrated with my dog\u2019s outbursts. If I signed, my name would be public, and I worried they\u2019d see me as someone who cared more about causes than about being a good neighbor. My thumb hovered over the screen, torn between the expectations of my community and my commitment to advocacy, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in."}
