As her mentor, I felt the weight of responsibility to encourage her growth, to help her see her strengths and prepare her for the challenge ahead. She needed guidance, honest feedback, and maybe even a little push to share more about her experiences\u2014something that could set her apart.\n\nBut as our conversation drifted, she mentioned her recent volunteer work, the same organization where I also volunteered. She spoke warmly about the people she\u2019d met, and I realized I knew exactly who she was talking about. I wanted to help her articulate the impact she\u2019d made, to use those stories to showcase her empathy and leadership. Yet, as a volunteer, I was bound to respect the privacy of those we helped. Even though nothing sensitive had been said, I hesitated. Should I encourage her to share more, risking the line between helpful mentorship and betraying the trust of those we serve? The expectations of both roles pressed in on me, and I felt the tension rising, unsure which path to take."}
