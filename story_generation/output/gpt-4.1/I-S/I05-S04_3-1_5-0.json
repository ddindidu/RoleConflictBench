As a mentor, I\u2019d promised to walk her through this critical report\u2014her first major assignment, and one where a single error could cost the company dearly. She looked at me, anxious, waiting for my next piece of advice. I could see how much she depended on my guidance, and I felt the weight of that responsibility. But as a citizen, I also felt the pull of my duty to vote, a right I valued deeply. The polling station was only a short drive away, and my schedule was otherwise clear, but leaving now would mean abandoning her at the most crucial moment. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations: to be present and supportive as a mentor, or to fulfill my civic responsibility as a voter. The minutes ticked by, each one amplifying the tension between the two roles I couldn\u2019t ignore."}
