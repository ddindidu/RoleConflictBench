I remembered how hard it can be to feel out of place, so I smiled and walked over, determined to be welcoming. As we chatted, Jamie seemed to relax, laughing at a joke and finally opening up. Then, mid-conversation, Jamie finished the soda and, almost absentmindedly, tossed the empty can into the bushes, just a few feet from a bright \u201cNo Littering\u201d sign. My heart skipped. As a citizen, I felt a strong urge to say something\u2014remind Jamie about the rules, maybe even ask them to pick it up. But as an acquaintance, I worried about embarrassing Jamie or making them feel judged, especially when they\u2019d just started to feel comfortable. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between wanting to be friendly and approachable, and knowing I should stand up for what\u2019s right in our shared public space."}
