This was our last weekend together before he left for months, and I promised we\u2019d make every moment count. He wanted to visit our favorite caf\u00e9, walk by the river, just be together. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder of the high-stakes court proceeding today. As an advocate, my presence was non-negotiable; the client\u2019s future hinged on my arguments, and the team was counting on me to be there, sharp and prepared. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing down. He stirred, smiling sleepily, and I saw the hope in his eyes for a perfect day. My heart twisted. I wanted to be the girlfriend he needed, to hold his hand and make memories before he left. But duty called, and I couldn\u2019t ignore the responsibility I owed my client. The clock ticked louder, and I sat on the edge of the bed, torn between love and obligation, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
