I glance at my girlfriend, her eyes red from crying, her voice trembling as she says, \u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing this. Are we even right for each other?\u201d The argument from earlier still hangs in the air, thick and unresolved. I know she expects me to stay, to talk things through, to prove that I care enough to fight for us. But the protest is happening now, and I promised my friends I\u2019d always show up when it mattered. They count on me to be there, to help keep things peaceful and visible. My heart pounds as I weigh her pain against the cause I believe in. I want to be the boyfriend who stays and listens, but I also want to be the activist who never lets his friends down. The clock ticks, and I feel myself pulled in two, unable to move."}
