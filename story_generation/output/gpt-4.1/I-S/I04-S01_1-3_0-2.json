It was Jamie, my closest friend, texting, \u201cRough day. Can you talk?\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words. I knew she needed me to listen, to be there for her like I always promised. But I glanced at the clock\u2014my shift at the community center started in fifteen minutes, and I was the only one with the keys. People would already be waiting outside, counting on me to open up and get things started. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me: Jamie\u2019s need for comfort, the community\u2019s need for reliability. My heart raced as I stared at my phone, torn between being the friend Jamie deserved and the volunteer everyone depended on."}
