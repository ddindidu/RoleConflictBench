I\u2019m really stuck,\u201d he texted. I hesitated, but as an acquaintance, I felt obligated to help. I grabbed my jacket, ready to lend a hand, when suddenly the building alarms blared. A voice crackled over the intercom: \u201cFlash-flood warning. Please evacuate or move to higher floors immediately.\u201d I looked out the window and saw water creeping up the street, swirling around parked cars. \n\nAs a citizen, I knew I should follow the emergency protocols, maybe even help neighbors who might need assistance. But Sam was waiting, probably counting on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the urge to help a friend and the responsibility to heed the warning and look out for the community\u2019s safety.
