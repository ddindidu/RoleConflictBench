As her mentor, I knew my role was to encourage her to take initiative and showcase her leadership, even if it meant challenging the status quo. I wanted to tell her to trust her instincts, to speak up if she saw a better way of doing things. But my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer coordinator: a new set of safety protocols had just been rolled out, and we were all expected to follow them to the letter, no exceptions. I was supposed to model compliance and reinforce the importance of following instructions, especially with the new changes. Maya\u2019s questions about how to stand out in her interview suddenly felt loaded. Should I urge her to be bold and innovative, or remind her of the importance of following established guidelines? The expectations of my two roles pressed in on me, each demanding a different answer, and I felt a knot of anxiety tighten in my chest as I tried to reconcile them."}
