She looked up, her smile a little forced, and I could tell something was off. I wanted to ask her about her day, to sit with her and listen, maybe make her tea\u2014just be there, the way she always is for me. But as I glanced at the clock, I remembered the polling station would close in a couple of hours. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote this year, no excuses. It was important, a civic duty I actually cared about. Still, Mia\u2019s shoulders were tense, her eyes tired. She didn\u2019t say much, but I could feel her need for comfort, for me to be present. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between the urge to stay and support her and the responsibility tugging me toward the door. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught in the space between what she needed and what I owed to something bigger than us."}
