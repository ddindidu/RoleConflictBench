She was missing deadlines, feeling overwhelmed, and looking to me for guidance. As her mentor, I knew I needed to help her find balance, encourage her to prioritize, and support her growth. I wanted to give her my full attention, to listen and offer practical advice.

They were counting on me to stand up for the cause, to be present and vocal in this moment. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014Maya\u2019s anxious eyes searching mine for reassurance, and the urgent call to action vibrating in my pocket.
