As her mentor, I wanted to help her find balance, to encourage her to prioritize and grow. I offered gentle advice, suggesting she carve out time for herself and set clearer boundaries. But as I spoke, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the volunteer shift at the community center was starting soon. I remembered the coordinator\u2019s email\u2014she\u2019d suggested we reorganize the supply closet if we had extra time, a task I knew would take at least an hour. I felt torn. If I stayed longer with Jamie, I\u2019d be late and might not follow the coordinator\u2019s new guidelines. If I left now, I\u2019d cut short a conversation that could really help Jamie. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014one asking me to be present and supportive, the other expecting reliability and adherence to instructions. My mind raced, caught between the urge to nurture and the need to comply, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
