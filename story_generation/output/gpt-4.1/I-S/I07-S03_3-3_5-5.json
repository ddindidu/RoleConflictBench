My manager\u2019s reminder echoed in my mind: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a delay\u2014our client\u2019s waiting.\u201d The task was on the critical path, and if I didn\u2019t finish it today, the whole project would stall. My colleagues were counting on me, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. But then my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polling place for the ballot measure about our block\u2019s zoning would close in two hours. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, to have a say in the changes coming to our neighborhood. As a citizen, I believed in participating, in making my voice heard. But the clock was ticking, and I couldn\u2019t do both at once. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations\u2014my team\u2019s trust in me as a colleague, my responsibility as a citizen. I felt torn, the pressure mounting, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left undone."}
