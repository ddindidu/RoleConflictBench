As her boyfriend, I knew she needed me to listen, to help us find a way through this mess, to resolve the conflict before it tore us apart. But my phone buzzed with a message from a client, desperate for legal advice. I\u2019d promised to be available, to give clear, accurate guidance, not just vague reassurances. \n\nMia\u2019s words blurred with the client\u2019s anxious questions in my mind. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one part of me aching to comfort Mia, to fight for us, the other knowing my client depended on me for answers that could change their life. I tried to focus on Mia, but guilt gnawed at me for not responding to my client. My chest tightened as I realized I couldn\u2019t give either of them what they needed at this moment. I stared at the table, torn, the weight of both roles pressing down, unsure which demand to answer first."}
