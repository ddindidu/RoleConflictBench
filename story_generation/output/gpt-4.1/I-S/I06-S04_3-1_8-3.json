My mentor had squeezed in our session just before catching a flight, and I knew how precious this hour was to her. She\u2019d rearranged her schedule, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second of her time. As I hurried to the meeting spot, I patted my pockets and realized my wallet was missing\u2014no ID, no way to vote later unless I went home to get it. The polling station was only open for a few more hours, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote today. I could still fetch my spare ID later, but it would mean cutting the session short or being distracted, disrespecting my mentor\u2019s effort. My mind raced: do I focus on the rare chance to learn from her, or do I risk disappointing her by leaving early to fulfill my civic duty? The weight of both responsibilities pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between honoring my mentor\u2019s time and upholding my role as a responsible voter."}
