My heart pounds with anticipation; this is my chance to reach thousands, to educate and inspire action. As I rehearse my opening lines in my head, I hear a hesitant voice behind me. It\u2019s Maya, my mentee, notebook in hand, eyes wide with curiosity. \u201cCan I ask you something about the project data?\u201d she whispers, clearly hoping for a quick answer before I disappear into the studio. \n\nI know how much she values these moments, how she relies on my guidance to grow.
