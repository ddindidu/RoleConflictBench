My phone buzzed with a reminder: the online candidate forum for my district was starting. As a citizen, I\u2019d promised myself to be more engaged\u2014watch the debates, ask questions, vote responsibly. But as a colleague, I was already behind on this report, and I knew that if I didn\u2019t finish tonight, the next person in the chain would be delayed. The pressure was mounting; my team was counting on me to keep things moving, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. Yet, I also felt the weight of my civic duty, the sense that if I didn\u2019t participate, I was letting my community down too. My mind raced, torn between the glowing spreadsheet and the live stream\u2019s countdown. I could feel the tension in my chest, the frustration of being pulled in two directions, each demanding my full attention, each important in its own way."}
