As a colleague, I was expected to join our weekly team catch-up, contribute ideas, and show I was engaged. Even though the meeting would be recorded, I knew my absence would be noticed, and I didn\u2019t want to seem disengaged. But here I was, standing at the polling station, ballot envelope in hand, as the poll worker politely explained that my signature had smudged. \u201cCould you please re-sign this? It\u2019s just to make sure your vote counts,\u201d she said. I knew the rules\u2014voters were supposed to follow every instruction to ensure their ballot wasn\u2019t rejected. My mind raced. If I stayed to fix the envelope, I\u2019d miss the meeting and risk disappointing my team. If I rushed back to my car to join the call, I might not get another chance to fix my ballot. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me, and I felt torn, caught between my responsibility as a colleague and my duty as a voter."}
