He smiled and nodded, and I felt the familiar tug to be friendly, to stop and exchange a few words. But just as I opened my mouth, a poll worker called out to me, holding up my envelope. \u201cExcuse me, could you please re-sign this? The signature smudged, and we want to make sure your vote counts.\u201d Her tone was polite but firm, and I knew the rules were strict\u2014no distractions, no lingering, just follow the process exactly as instructed.\n\nI glanced back at Mark, who was waiting for a response, his expression open and expectant. I didn\u2019t want to seem rude or unfriendly, but the poll worker\u2019s eyes were on me, and I could feel the weight of the rules pressing down. My mind raced, torn between the urge to maintain that easy friendliness and the responsibility to do everything by the book as a voter. The hallway felt suddenly smaller, the silence heavier, as I stood there caught between two sets of expectations, unsure which to honor first."}
