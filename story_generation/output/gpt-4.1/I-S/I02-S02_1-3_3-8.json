We\u2019d both finally found a week with free evenings, and she\u2019d been excitedly texting me about trying that new Italian place. I could almost hear her laughter, see her eyes light up across the table. Just as I was about to call her, my phone buzzed again\u2014this time, a message from the activist group. A major news network wanted me on air tonight, right now, to counter a wave of misinformation about our cause. My heart pounded. I knew how much Maya valued our time together, how she\u2019d been looking forward to this after weeks of us missing each other. But I also knew how crucial it was to speak up, to set the record straight before the public latched onto the wrong story. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between the person I love and the cause I believe in."}
