My mentor had always emphasized the importance of reaching out whenever I hit a snag, no matter how minor. Today, I stumbled over a term in the project notes\u2014nothing urgent, but I could hear her voice in my head: \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to ask, even about small things.\u201d At the same time, my phone buzzed with an email from the volunteer coordinator. She\u2019d suggested a new way to organize the supply closet, only if I had extra time during my shift. I knew she valued flexibility, but she also expected us to follow her guidance closely. I felt a tug in both directions. Should I pause and email my mentor about the terminology, or use that window to tackle the supply closet at the community center? I didn\u2019t want to let either of them down, but I could already feel the tension building in my chest as I weighed whose expectations to meet first."}
