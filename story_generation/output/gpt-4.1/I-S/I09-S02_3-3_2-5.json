The noise complaint had everyone on edge, and I knew I needed to be calm and friendly, smoothing things over with a smile and gentle words. Mrs. Lee caught my eye, her frown softening as I greeted her. But my phone buzzed urgently in my pocket\u2014a text from my activist group. The vote on the housing bill was happening in less than an hour, and the undecided representative was taking calls now. My group was counting on me to make my voice heard, to push for the change we\u2019d worked so hard for. I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in: the expectation to be the good neighbor, present and polite, and the activist, ready to act at a moment\u2019s notice. My hands trembled as I tried to focus on the conversation, but my mind raced with what I might lose, no matter which role I chose to honor in this moment."}
