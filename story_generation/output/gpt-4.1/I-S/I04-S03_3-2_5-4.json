I\u2019d been looking forward to it all week\u2014this was my chance to hear the candidates\u2019 positions and maybe even submit a question. But the message on my screen made my heart race: it was my friend, stranded on the side of the highway, scared and alone, asking if I could come get them right away. As a friend, I knew I should drop everything and help, especially this late at night. But as a citizen, I felt a responsibility to stay informed and participate in the forum, especially with the election coming up and so many important issues at stake. I stared at my phone, torn between the immediate need of someone I cared about and my duty to my community, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
