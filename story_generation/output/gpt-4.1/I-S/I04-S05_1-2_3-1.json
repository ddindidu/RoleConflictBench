She was waiting for my call, anxious about the new evidence that had surfaced. As her advocate, I knew she depended on me to explain her options clearly and help her make the right decisions. The stakes were high, and I couldn\u2019t afford to be distracted.\n\nBut then, a message popped up from Sam: \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m totally lost with this bookshelf and the instructions make no sense.\u201d I could hear the frustration in his words. Sam had always been there for me, and I knew he was counting on me to help him out, especially since he\u2019d just moved in and didn\u2019t have anyone else nearby.\n\nI stared at my phone, feeling the pressure build. On one hand, my client needed my undivided attention and expertise. On the other, my friend needed me, too\u2014right now, not later. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility I owed to Mrs. Lee and the loyalty I felt toward Sam."}
