My mentee\u2019s project deadline is tomorrow, and I promised to review her latest draft tonight. She\u2019s counting on my feedback\u2014she\u2019s anxious, and I know how much this means to her. I open her email, ready to dive in, when my phone lights up again. The activist group\u2019s post about our cause is exploding online. Hundreds of people are asking questions, hungry for information. If I comment now, I could reach thousands, maybe even sway public opinion. But if I turn away from my mentee, she might feel abandoned, lose confidence, or miss her chance to shine.

The weight of both roles presses down on me, and I can\u2019t ignore the feeling that, whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
