He sounded upset, thinking I\u2019d forgotten our weekend plans, when really, I\u2019d just misunderstood the time. I knew I should call him right away, clear things up before it turned into a bigger issue. That\u2019s what a good girlfriend would do\u2014resolve conflicts quickly, not let them fester. But just as I was about to dial, my email pinged. It was the volunteer coordinator, suggesting we reorganize the supply closet if we had a spare moment today. I was already at the community center, and I knew she expected me to follow her instructions, even if it wasn\u2019t urgent. I could feel the pressure building\u2014my boyfriend needed reassurance, but the coordinator counted on me to be reliable and responsive. I stood in the hallway, phone in one hand, email open on the other, torn between smoothing things over with him and proving myself as a dependable volunteer. My heart raced as I weighed which expectation to meet first, feeling the tug of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
