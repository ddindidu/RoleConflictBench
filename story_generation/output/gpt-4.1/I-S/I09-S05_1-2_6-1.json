She\u2019s missed packages before, and I know how much she relies on me to help out. I promised her I\u2019d keep an eye out, and I want to be the kind of neighbor who\u2019s there when needed. But just as I\u2019m settling in, my phone buzzes with an urgent email from a client. Their case has taken a complicated turn, and they need a thorough explanation of their options\u2014now. As an advocate, I owe them my full attention and clear, careful advice. I can\u2019t afford distractions or delays; their trust and possibly their future depend on it. I feel the pressure mounting, torn between the simple, human expectation of being a good neighbor and the professional, weighty responsibility of guiding my client. My mind races, guilt and anxiety twisting together as I try to figure out how to be present for both, knowing I can\u2019t give either the attention they truly deserve."}
