They needed me on air, right now, to counter a wave of misinformation about our cause. My heart pounded\u2014I knew how important it was to speak up, to set the record straight for thousands of viewers. But as I reached for my laptop, my dog started barking at the sound of footsteps in the hallway. Mrs. Lee from next door shot me a weary look through the peephole; she\u2019d already complained about the noise last week. I felt the weight of her expectation\u2014be a good neighbor, keep the peace, respect the shared space. But the activist in me screamed that this was my moment to make a difference. I stood frozen, torn between calming my dog to avoid another neighborly confrontation and rushing to my computer to answer the call for my cause. The hallway echoed with my dog\u2019s barks, and my phone kept ringing, each demand pulling me in opposite directions."}
