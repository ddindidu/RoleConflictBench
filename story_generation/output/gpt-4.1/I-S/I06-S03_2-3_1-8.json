The assignment was due in three days, and I knew how much my mentor valued diligence and follow-through. I wanted to prove myself, to show I could be trusted with responsibility. Suddenly, the shrill wail of the building alarm cut through my concentration. My phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning\u2014water was already creeping up the street outside. I glanced out the window and saw neighbors gathering, some struggling to move their cars or help the elderly evacuate. As a citizen, I felt the pull to join them, to do my part in keeping everyone safe, just as I\u2019d always believed was right. But the unfinished code glared at me, a reminder of my promise to my mentor. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, torn between the urgent needs of my community and the commitment I\u2019d made to my mentor."}
