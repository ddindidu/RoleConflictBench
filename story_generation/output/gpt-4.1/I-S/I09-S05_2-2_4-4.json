I knew immediately what was happening\u2014Mrs. Patel from next door must have been passing by our shared entrance again. As a neighbor, I\u2019ve always tried to be considerate, keeping shared spaces quiet and respecting boundaries. But my dog\u2019s anxious barking has become a sore point, and I could sense the tension building with every echo down the hall.\n\nAt the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder about my client\u2019s case. The hearing today was pivotal, and as their advocate, I was expected to be fully prepared, focused, and ready to represent them with unwavering attention. But the guilt gnawed at me\u2014should I pause to calm my dog and perhaps apologize to Mrs. Patel, or should I push it aside and concentrate on my client\u2019s needs? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the expectations of being a good neighbor and a dedicated advocate."}
