First, a text from Jamie: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that. I thought you understood.\u201d The words sting. I scroll up, rereading my last message, realizing how my rushed tone could have sounded cold. Jamie\u2019s been my friend since college, and we\u2019ve always promised to talk things out, never let misunderstandings fester. I know I should call her right now, explain, reassure her that I care.\n\nBut then my phone rings again. It\u2019s the number I\u2019ve been waiting for all week\u2014a legislative aide for Senator Brooks. We\u2019ve been fighting for this bill for months, and this is the window to make our case. The aide says she only has ten minutes. If I miss this, the chance might not come again. My heart pounds as I stare at my phone, torn between the urgent call of friendship and the rare opportunity to push for real change. Both matter deeply to me, and both demand my immediate attention. I can feel the pressure building, my loyalty to Jamie and my commitment to the cause pulling me in opposite directions."}
