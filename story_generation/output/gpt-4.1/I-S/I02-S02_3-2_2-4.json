She had just lost her brother, and I knew she needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words, my presence. I wanted nothing more than to hold her, to let her know I was here, that she wasn\u2019t alone in her grief.\n\nBut then my phone lit up with a call from the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks. This was the moment\u2014ten minutes to make my case for the bill that could change lives. My fellow activists were counting on me, and I\u2019d promised to do everything I could. I felt the weight of their expectations pressing on my shoulders, the urgency of the cause burning in my chest.\n\nI looked at my girlfriend, then at the phone, my heart pounding.
