I promised myself I\u2019d watch it live, take notes, maybe even submit a question\u2014being an engaged citizen matters to me, especially with the election coming up. But as I set my phone down, I see my girlfriend curled up on the couch, eyes red and shoulders slumped. She just got off a call with her boss, and the feedback was harsher than she expected. I know she needs me right now, someone to listen, to reassure her that she\u2019s more than her job performance. My mind races: if I miss the forum, I\u2019ll lose my chance to participate, to help shape the conversation in my community. But if I focus on the forum, I\u2019ll be letting her down when she needs me most. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I feel torn, wishing I could split myself in two."}
