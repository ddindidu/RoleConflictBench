As an acquaintance, I\u2019d always believed in keeping my distance from gossip, never fueling rumors or speaking ill of others. But today, I\u2019d accidentally learned something about Maya\u2014something that, if shared, could seriously damage her reputation. My phone buzzed: a reminder for the advocacy meeting I was supposed to attend in ten minutes. As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable; my clients and colleagues depended on me to be present and prepared, especially at these frequent meetings.\n\nBut now, I was torn. If I left for the meeting, I\u2019d be abandoning the chance to steer the conversation away from Maya, possibly allowing the gossip to spread unchecked. If I stayed to intervene, I\u2019d risk being late, letting down those who relied on my advocacy. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations\u2014protecting someone\u2019s dignity as an acquaintance, or fulfilling my duty as an advocate. The clock ticked, and I felt the pressure mounting, caught between two roles that suddenly seemed impossible to balance."}
