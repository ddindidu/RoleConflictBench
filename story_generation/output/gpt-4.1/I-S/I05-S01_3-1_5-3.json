Today, I\u2019m guiding a new volunteer through the process, explaining every detail, making sure they understand the gravity of what we\u2019re doing. But as a volunteer myself, I know how important it is to respect the privacy and confidentiality of those we help. During a break, the new volunteer asks about a previous case, just out of curiosity. The conversation is casual, nothing sensitive is mentioned, but I can sense the line blurring. My mentee expects me to provide real examples to help them learn, but I feel the weight of my responsibility to protect the privacy of those we serve. My mind races, torn between the urge to give a thorough, helpful answer and the need to uphold the trust placed in me as a volunteer. I hesitate, feeling the tension build inside me, unsure which expectation I should honor in this moment."}
