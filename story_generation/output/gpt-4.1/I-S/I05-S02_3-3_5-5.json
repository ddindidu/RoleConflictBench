My mentee, Sarah, was anxiously waiting for my guidance on a complex project\u2014one where a single misstep could cost the company dearly. She looked at me, notebook open, ready to absorb every bit of knowledge I could offer. I knew how much she depended on me, how much she trusted my experience to steer her right.\n\nJust as I began to explain the crucial steps, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from the activist group. The legislation we\u2019d been fighting for was coming to a surprise vote in less than an hour. The outcome hinged on one undecided representative, and I was the only one with a direct line to their office. My heart pounded. If I didn\u2019t act now, months of advocacy could unravel. But if I left Sarah in the lurch, she might make a costly mistake.\n\nI felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. My mind raced, caught between the responsibility to guide and the duty to act."}
