As a mentee, I knew I was supposed to reach out to my mentor whenever I hit a wall, and this technical hurdle was definitely one. But the problem was tangled up with my volunteer work. I\u2019d been sorting confidential medical files for a local clinic, and the error in my project was directly related to the way the files were formatted. If I explained the issue to my mentor, I\u2019d have to mention details about the files\u2014details I\u2019d promised to keep private as a volunteer. My mentor expected honesty and communication, but the clinic trusted me to protect sensitive information. I felt the pressure from both sides, my mind racing with possible ways to explain the problem without breaking confidentiality. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, and I sat frozen, torn between the need to ask for help and the promise I\u2019d made to the people I was helping."}
