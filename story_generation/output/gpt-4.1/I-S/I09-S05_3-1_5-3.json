The HOA inspection is tomorrow, and I know anything blocking the hallway could get cited. As her neighbor, I want to be considerate\u2014she relies on that walker being close by, and the bags are probably groceries she can\u2019t carry all at once. But the rules are clear, and I don\u2019t want to risk a fine for her or the building.\n\nAt the same time, I\u2019m due in court for a minor hearing. My client\u2019s case isn\u2019t high-stakes, but I still have a duty to represent them well. They expect me to be focused and prepared, not distracted by neighborhood issues. I feel the pressure mounting: do I knock on Mrs. Patel\u2019s door and risk being late, or do I leave and hope the inspector overlooks it? My mind races with the competing demands\u2014being a good neighbor means looking out for Mrs. Patel, but being a good advocate means showing up for my client, fully present. I stand in the hallway, torn, the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
