I just need someone to talk to.\u201d I knew Jamie counted on me to listen, to be the friend who always replied quickly and offered comfort. I started typing a response, but as I walked, I noticed a group of people picnicking nearby. One of them tossed a crumpled soda can onto the grass, just a few steps from a trash bin and right under a bright \u201cNo Littering\u201d sign. I felt a surge of irritation\u2014should I say something? As a citizen, I believed in keeping our parks clean and respecting public spaces. But if I stopped to confront the litterer, I\u2019d leave Jamie waiting, maybe feeling ignored or unimportant. My thumb hovered over the send button, my eyes darting between the phone and the can on the grass, torn between being the supportive friend Jamie needed and the responsible citizen I wanted to be."}
