My mentor, who squeezed me in before her flight, is waiting on the video call. She\u2019s been generous with her time, and I know how much she values punctuality and focus. I owe her my respect, my attention\u2014she\u2019s helped me grow so much. But as I open my laptop, a notification pops up: a fellow activist is live-streaming from a protest downtown. The turnout is small, and they\u2019re asking for backup. I know how crucial numbers are for visibility and safety. My activist friends count on me to show up, to stand with them when it matters. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014my mentor\u2019s trust, my activist community\u2019s need. My hands tremble as I hover between the call and the live stream, torn by the fear of letting someone down, no matter what I choose."}
