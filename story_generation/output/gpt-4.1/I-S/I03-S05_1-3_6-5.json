Why do you keep forgetting?\u201d My heart sank. As his girlfriend, I knew I should call him, talk it out, and smooth over the misunderstanding before it grew into something bigger. He expected me to be present, to care enough to resolve things quickly. But my laptop chimed with another email\u2014my client\u2019s case was going to trial tomorrow, and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. I was their advocate, the one they trusted to fight for their future. I needed to review evidence, prep arguments, and anticipate every move the opposition might make. My mind raced, torn between the urge to fix things with Alex and the pressure to be the unwavering support my client needed. Both roles demanded my full attention, both felt urgent, and I could feel the tension building inside me as I weighed which expectation I would have to let down, at least for now."}
