They needed my confirmation on a partnership detail\u2014something that couldn\u2019t wait, not with the external partner expecting a reply today. As a colleague, I knew the team counted on me to be responsive, to keep things moving smoothly. But just as I started typing my response, my client called. Her voice trembled as she described a sudden legal complication, one that demanded immediate, careful advice. As her advocate, I owed her my full attention and the most accurate guidance I could give. My inbox pinged again\u2014another nudge from leadership. I stared at my screen, heart pounding, torn between the team\u2019s need for efficiency and my client\u2019s need for clarity. Both roles demanded my presence, both situations urgent, and I felt the weight of their expectations pressing in from all sides."}
