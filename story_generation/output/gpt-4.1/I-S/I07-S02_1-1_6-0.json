I glance at the clock\u2014mid-afternoon, the office is quiet, and I could easily dash off a quick reply. But then my activist group chat lights up. A friend is live-streaming from a protest downtown, their voice tense as they ask for more people to join. The turnout is small, and the issue\u2014one I care deeply about\u2014needs every bit of visibility it can get. I feel the tug: my colleagues expect me to be present, responsive, a team player. But my activist friends count on me to show up, to stand with them when it matters most. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between the polite, professional reply and grabbing my coat to rush out the door. The weight of both expectations presses on me, and I can\u2019t ignore the growing knot in my stomach as I try to decide which role to honor first."}
