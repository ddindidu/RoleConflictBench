My mentor\u2019s face filled the screen, her voice calm but brisk\u2014she\u2019d squeezed this session in just before her flight, and I knew how precious her time was. I wanted to show respect, to listen closely, to ask thoughtful questions. But a notification flashed: \u201cPolling station closes in 10 minutes.\u201d I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, that I\u2019d be a responsible citizen. The station was only a few blocks away, but if I left now, I\u2019d cut my mentor off mid-sentence, wasting her rare availability. If I stayed, I\u2019d miss my chance to vote, betraying my own values and civic duty. My mind raced, torn between gratitude and obligation, between personal growth and public responsibility. I tried to focus on her words, but my eyes kept darting to the clock, my stomach twisting tighter with every passing second."}
