She\u2019d poured her heart into her project, and this demonstration was her chance to present it to the public, to make her mark. As her mentor, I was supposed to encourage her, to help her seize opportunities, even bold ones. The crowd surged forward, and someone shouted that we should cross the barricade\u2014just a few steps onto city property, where the press could see us better. My mentee looked at me, hope and fear mingling in her gaze. I knew that breaking the rule could get us noticed, maybe even launch her career. But as a citizen, I was supposed to respect the law, to set an example, not just for her but for everyone watching. My heart pounded as I weighed the risks, feeling the pressure of her expectations and the silent judgment of the city around us. I hesitated, torn between helping her shine and upholding what I knew was right."}
