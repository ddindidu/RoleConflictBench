As a mentor, I felt a familiar warmth\u2014this was my chance to share what I\u2019d learned, to help Jamie grow. I started explaining how I approach casual consultations, how I try to put clients at ease with general explanations. Jamie nodded, jotting down notes, eager for every detail.\n\nBut as I spoke, a knot tightened in my stomach. As an advocate, I knew the weight of my responsibility: clients depended on me for precise, accurate legal advice, not just friendly guidance. The line between sharing my experience and oversimplifying the law blurred. What if Jamie took my casual approach as a model and missed a crucial detail with a client? What if my offhand advice led to a misunderstanding?\n\nI could feel the expectations of both roles pressing in\u2014Jamie\u2019s trust in me as a mentor, my duty to clients as their advocate. My mind raced, torn between nurturing Jamie\u2019s learning and upholding the standards my clients deserved."}
