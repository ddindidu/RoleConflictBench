They looked at me expectantly, eager for the knowledge and experience I promised to share. I had spent hours preparing this session, determined to give them every tool they needed to succeed. Just as I was about to begin, my phone buzzed. It was a message from the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks\u2014she had ten minutes to talk, right now, about the bill I\u2019d been fighting for. My heart pounded. As an activist, I knew how rare and crucial this opportunity was; missing it could mean losing momentum for the policy change I believed in. But as a mentor, I saw the anxious faces before me, counting on my guidance. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention at the same moment. My mind raced, caught between the urgent call for advocacy and the immediate needs of those I was meant to support."}
