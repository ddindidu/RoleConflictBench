The room felt heavy, thick with the kind of grief that makes time slow down. I wanted nothing more than to hold him, to be the steady presence he needed, to listen and comfort him through the storm of losing his father. But my phone buzzed again\u2014another reminder about the meeting I was supposed to attend in twenty minutes. As an advocate, punctuality wasn\u2019t just a courtesy; it was a professional expectation. Missing meetings could mean letting down clients who depended on me, and I\u2019d already rescheduled twice this week. My heart twisted as I looked at my partner, torn between the urge to stay and the obligation to go. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. I felt the sting of guilt either way, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
