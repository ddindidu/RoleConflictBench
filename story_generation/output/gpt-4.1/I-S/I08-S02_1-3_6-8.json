As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip or speaking ill of others, but the conversation was getting heated, and I could feel the expectation to chime in. My phone buzzed urgently\u2014an email from a major news network. They needed me, right now, to go on air and counter misinformation about the cause I\u2019d devoted years to as an activist. My heart pounded. The group\u2019s eyes turned to me, waiting for my opinion on Sarah, while the network\u2019s producer waited for my confirmation. I knew the activist in me should seize this rare chance to educate the public, but the acquaintance in me felt the weight of loyalty and discretion. I could sense the tension in my chest, torn between the immediate demands of my friends and the pressing call to action from the world outside."}
