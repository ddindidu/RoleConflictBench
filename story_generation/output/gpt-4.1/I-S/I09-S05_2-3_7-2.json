As their advocate, I knew they depended on me for clear, immediate legal advice\u2014tonight, of all nights, when a single misstep could cost them dearly. My phone buzzed with a weather alert: the storm advisory was now a warning. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, who lived alone just down the hall. She\u2019d asked me once to check in if anything ever happened. I glanced at the clock; the storm would hit soon. Should I knock on her door, make sure she was safe, maybe help her prepare? But my client\u2019s email blinked insistently on my screen, and I could almost feel their anxiety through the words. I was torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me\u2014one demanding my presence and care in the hallway, the other my undivided attention and expertise at my desk. My heart pounded as I stood between the two doors, uncertain which responsibility to answer first."}
