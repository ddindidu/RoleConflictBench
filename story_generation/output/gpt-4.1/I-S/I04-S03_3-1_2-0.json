My friend\u2019s voice trembled on the other end, words tumbling out between sobs about a family emergency. I could hear the pain, the need for comfort, and I knew my role: to listen, to be present, to offer whatever support I could. The next day, still heavy with worry, I met her for a walk in the park, hoping fresh air might help. She clutched a crumpled tissue, eyes red, and as we passed a trash bin, she absentmindedly tossed the tissue onto the grass, missing the bin entirely. She didn\u2019t notice, lost in her grief. I froze. As a citizen, I felt the weight of the no-littering signs, the responsibility to keep our shared spaces clean, to respect the rules. But as her friend, I didn\u2019t want to embarrass her or add to her distress by pointing out the mistake. My mind raced, torn between quietly picking up the tissue or letting it go, wrestling with the expectations of both roles pressing in on me."}
