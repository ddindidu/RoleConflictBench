I replay the offhand comment I made at lunch, realizing too late how it must have sounded. As a friend, I know I should call Jamie right now, apologize, and talk it through before the hurt festers. But my laptop screen flashes the radio station\u2019s countdown\u2014five minutes until I go live to talk about climate justice, a cause I\u2019ve poured my heart into. The organizers are counting on me to represent our movement, to educate listeners and inspire action. My hands tremble as I weigh the phone in my palm. Jamie deserves my honesty and care, but so many people are waiting to hear my voice on the airwaves. I can\u2019t do both at once. My heart pounds as I stare at the clock, torn between the friend who needs me and the cause that depends on me."}
