He reached for my hand, his eyes searching mine, and I felt the weight of this last weekend pressing down on us. He was leaving for months, and we\u2019d promised to make every moment count. My phone buzzed, and I glanced at the screen\u2014an urgent message from my activist group. The vote we\u2019d been working toward for months was happening in an hour, and the outcome hinged on one undecided representative. They needed me to call, to lobby, to be the voice that could tip the scales. Alex squeezed my hand, smiling softly, and I saw the hope in his eyes for a perfect day together. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the person I loved and the cause I\u2019d poured myself into. The caf\u00e9 felt suddenly too small, the air thick with expectation, and I wondered how I could possibly choose."}
