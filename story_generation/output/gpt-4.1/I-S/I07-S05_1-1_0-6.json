My team\u2019s weekly catch-up was starting in ten minutes, and I was expected to be there, camera on, ready to contribute. As a colleague, I knew my absence would be noticed, even if the meeting was recorded. My manager always emphasized the importance of showing up, of being present for the team, even for routine updates.\n\nBut at the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the advocacy group\u2019s standing meeting was about to begin. As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable. The group relied on me to represent our clients, to be their voice in court sessions and planning meetings. Missing even a routine check-in could mean missing crucial updates or letting someone down.\n\nI stared at the screen, feeling the pressure build. Both roles demanded my presence, both expected my full attention. I wanted to be a reliable colleague, but I also couldn\u2019t let down those who depended on my advocacy. My mind raced, torn between two worlds, each pulling me in a different direction."}
