First, a call from Mark, an old college friend I hadn\u2019t seen in months. \u201cHey, I\u2019m stuck on Route 9\u2014my car just died. Can you help me out?\u201d His voice was tight with worry. I glanced at the clock; I had a client consultation in ten minutes. As an advocate, I knew my client was waiting for urgent legal advice about a contract dispute that could cost her business everything. She\u2019d emailed me twice already this morning, her messages growing more anxious. Mark\u2019s call tugged at my sense of loyalty\u2014he\u2019d helped me move apartments last year, and I owed him. But my client was depending on me for clarity and guidance, and any delay could have serious consequences for her.
