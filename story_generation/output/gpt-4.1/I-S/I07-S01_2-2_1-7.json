The team meeting was about to start in ten minutes, and I knew I couldn\u2019t miss it\u2014our manager had stressed that today\u2019s updates were crucial and wouldn\u2019t be sent out afterward. My teammates counted on me to contribute, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down. But at the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer coordinator: I was scheduled to help at the community center this afternoon, and the new safety procedures from yesterday\u2019s briefing were mandatory. The coordinator had emphasized that everyone needed to follow the updated steps to keep the center running smoothly and safely. I felt torn, knowing that if I skipped the meeting, I\u2019d be out of the loop at work, but if I missed my volunteer shift or didn\u2019t apply the new guidelines, I\u2019d be letting down the people who relied on me there. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I sat frozen, unsure which responsibility to choose."}
