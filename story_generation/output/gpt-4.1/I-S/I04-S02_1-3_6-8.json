One is from Jamie, my best friend, who\u2019s clearly confused about where we\u2019re supposed to meet for dinner. The other is from the news network, asking if I can go live in five minutes to address a wave of misinformation about our campaign. I know Jamie\u2019s been having a rough week, and I promised I\u2019d be there for them, especially after our last misunderstanding. But the activist in me knows how crucial this moment is\u2014if I don\u2019t speak up now, the public might believe the false narrative spreading like wildfire. My fingers hover over the screen, torn between sending Jamie a reassuring message and preparing my talking points for the interview. I can feel my heart pounding, the weight of both expectations pressing down on me. I want to be a good friend, to show up and communicate, but I also feel the responsibility to my cause and the people who count on me to speak out. The seconds tick by, and I\u2019m caught in the middle, unsure which role to answer first."}
