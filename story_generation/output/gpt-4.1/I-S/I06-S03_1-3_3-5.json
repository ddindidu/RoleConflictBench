As a mentee, I know I\u2019m supposed to reach out to my mentor whenever I hit a snag, no matter how small. Today, I stumbled over a bit of terminology in the project brief. It\u2019s not stopping my progress, but I remember my mentor\u2019s words: \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to ask, even about the little things.\u201d I draft an email, hesitating over the send button.\n\nBut then my phone buzzes with a reminder: the polls close in two hours. There\u2019s a ballot measure up for vote that could change the way our block handles parking\u2014something that will affect me and my neighbors directly. As a citizen, I believe in being engaged, showing up, and making my voice heard. I promised myself I\u2019d never skip an election, no matter how small.\n\nI feel torn. If I email my mentor now, I might get a quick reply and keep the momentum going. But if I leave for the polling place, I might miss the window to ask while it\u2019s fresh in my mind. My chest tightens as I weigh the expectations\u2014responsible mentee, active citizen\u2014each demanding my attention, each feeling urgent in its own way."}
