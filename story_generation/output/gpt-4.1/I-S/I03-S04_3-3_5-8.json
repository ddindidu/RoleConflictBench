My boyfriend squeezes my hand, his eyes searching mine for reassurance. It\u2019s our last weekend together before he leaves for months, and we promised to make every moment count. We\u2019d planned a picnic, a walk by the river, just us\u2014no distractions. But now, I\u2019m standing in a crowded polling station, clutching a provisional ballot form. The official\u2019s voice is firm: \u201cYou need to fill this out before we close in ten minutes, or you can\u2019t vote.\u201d I see the disappointment flicker across my boyfriend\u2019s face. He tries to smile, but I know he\u2019s thinking about the time slipping away. I want to be the girlfriend who keeps her promise, who makes these last hours special. But I also want to be a responsible voter, to do my civic duty, to not let a paperwork error silence my voice. The minutes tick by, and I feel torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on me as I try to decide which expectation I can bear to let down."}
