My boyfriend is waiting at the caf\u00e9 down the street, texting me sweet reminders about our long-overdue date night. We both finally have free evenings, and he\u2019s been looking forward to this\u2014just us, no distractions. But as I slip on my coat, my phone buzzes again. It\u2019s a reminder from the radio station: I\u2019m scheduled to go live in five minutes to talk about our campaign, a rare chance to reach thousands and maybe make a real difference. My mind races. He expects me to be present, to laugh and share stories over coffee, to show him he matters. But my fellow activists are counting on me to speak up, to educate, to be the voice for our cause. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in, my stomach twisting as I stand in the hallway, torn between love and responsibility, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
