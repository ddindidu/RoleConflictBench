As a mentor, I was supposed to nurture my mentee, Sarah, who was on the verge of a major promotion. She looked to me for guidance, expecting encouragement and honest feedback to help her grow. She\u2019d scheduled a meeting, eager to rehearse her presentation, and I knew how much this meant for her future.\n\nBut as an advocate, my client\u2019s case was heating up. The hearing was tomorrow, and new evidence had just surfaced. My client depended on me to be thorough, to represent them with unwavering focus. The stakes were high, and any misstep could cost them dearly.\n\nSarah\u2019s hopeful eyes and my client\u2019s anxious calls echoed in my mind. Both needed me\u2014one for inspiration, the other for protection. I felt torn, my heart racing as I stared at my calendar, realizing I couldn\u2019t give both the attention they deserved. The expectations clashed inside me, and I wrestled with the guilt of possibly letting someone down, unsure which role to prioritize as the clock ticked on."}
