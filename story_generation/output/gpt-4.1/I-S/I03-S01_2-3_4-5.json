He\u2019s been looking forward to it, dropping hints about a cozy dinner and maybe a movie at home. I promised him we\u2019d make the most of it, just us, no distractions. But as I\u2019m getting ready to leave work, my phone buzzes\u2014a last-minute request from the volunteer coordinator. They\u2019re short-handed at the clinic, and they need someone to help sort confidential medical files. I know how important it is to keep those records private, to respect the trust people place in us. I can\u2019t just say no, but I also can\u2019t break my promise to Alex. My heart pounds as I picture his disappointed face, and at the same time, I feel the weight of responsibility for the people who count on our discretion. I stand in the hallway, torn, the evening stretching ahead of me, split between two worlds that both need me right now."}
