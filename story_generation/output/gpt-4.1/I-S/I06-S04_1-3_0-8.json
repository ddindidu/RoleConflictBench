She\u2019d suggested a few articles to read, nothing urgent, but she always said, \u201cThe best mentees go the extra mile.\u201d I wanted to impress her, to show I was committed, so I\u2019d planned to spend the afternoon reading. But my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that today was the last day to vote. I rushed to the polling station, only to be told by an official that my registration had a mismatch. If I wanted my vote to count, I had to fill out a provisional ballot form, and the station closed in ten minutes. The official\u2019s instructions were clear: no mistakes, no delays. My mind raced. If I stayed, I\u2019d have no time for the reading my mentor expected. If I left, I\u2019d miss my chance to vote. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give."}
