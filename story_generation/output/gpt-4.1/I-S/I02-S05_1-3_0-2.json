Their legal issue is time-sensitive, and they\u2019re depending on me to provide clear, accurate advice\u2014tonight, not tomorrow. But as I step into the living room, I see my partner curled up on the couch, her eyes tired and distant. She tries to smile, but I can tell something\u2019s weighing on her. I know she needs me to be present, to listen, to offer comfort after her long, stressful day. I want to sit beside her, hold her hand, and let her talk it out. But my phone buzzes again, a reminder that my client is waiting, anxious and desperate for guidance. My heart tugs in two directions\u2014toward the person I love, who needs my emotional support, and toward my professional duty, where someone\u2019s future could hinge on my advice. I stand frozen, feeling the pressure mount, torn between being the boyfriend she deserves and the advocate my client needs."}
