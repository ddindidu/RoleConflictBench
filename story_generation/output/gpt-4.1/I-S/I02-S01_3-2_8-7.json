Our argument from last night had spiraled, and now she was questioning if we should even stay together. My chest tightened as I tried to find the right words to calm her, to resolve things like I always promised I would. But my mind kept drifting to the volunteer shift I was due to start in less than an hour. The coordinator had been clear: the new safety steps were non-negotiable, and everyone had to follow them to the letter. I knew if I was late or distracted, I\u2019d be letting the team down and possibly putting others at risk. My girlfriend\u2019s voice broke through my thoughts, pleading for reassurance, while my phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer group chat. I felt torn in two, the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I realized I couldn\u2019t possibly give both what they needed at the same time."}
