As a colleague, I knew I was expected to finish the draft report by Friday. There was plenty of buffer time, and honestly, the team could move forward without my section for a few days. Still, I didn\u2019t want to let anyone down or seem unreliable.\n\nBut my phone buzzed again\u2014a client, desperate for guidance. As their advocate, I was the only one who could help them navigate this sudden legal crisis. They needed clear, accurate advice, and they needed it now. I could hear the anxiety in their voice, feel the weight of their trust in me.\n\nMy mind raced. If I focused on the client, I\u2019d have to push my report aside, risking my reputation as a dependable teammate. If I stuck to my colleague duties, I\u2019d leave my client vulnerable, possibly facing serious consequences. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I felt torn, caught between loyalty to my team and responsibility to my client, unsure which demand to answer first."}
