The community center\u2019s free vaccine clinic was this weekend, and I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d go\u2014doing my part as a responsible citizen, especially with all the reminders about public health. Just as I was double-checking my forms, my phone buzzed. It was Jamie, an old acquaintance. Her car had broken down on a quiet road outside town, and she sounded anxious, asking if I could come help. As an acquaintance, I knew I should offer support\u2014she didn\u2019t have anyone else nearby. But the vaccine clinic was only open for a few hours, and I\u2019d already put off getting my shot once. If I went to help Jamie, I might miss the clinic and delay my own protection, not to mention the tax prep I\u2019d finally started. I felt torn, the weight of both expectations pressing in\u2014one personal, one civic\u2014each demanding my time, each important in its own way. My mind raced, caught between the pull of friendship and the call of community responsibility, unsure which path to take."}
