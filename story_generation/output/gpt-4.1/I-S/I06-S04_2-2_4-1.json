The technical hurdle was beyond anything I\u2019d faced before, and I knew my mentor expected me to reach out if I hit a wall. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart thudded faster\u2014polls would close in just under two hours, and I still had groceries to pick up for my family. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss voting this year, not after all the talk about civic duty. Yet, the thought of letting my mentor down gnawed at me. She\u2019d always said, \u201cDon\u2019t wait until the last minute to ask for help.\u201d If I emailed her now, she might reply quickly, and I could get back on track. But what if her response required a call or more time than I had? I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides.
