It was Sam, my friend who\u2019d just moved into a new apartment. \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m drowning in these furniture instructions and could really use your help.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u20147:00 p.m. The same time the online candidate forum for our district was starting, something I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d watch live so I could ask questions and stay informed before voting.\n\nAs a friend, I knew Sam was counting on me. He\u2019d helped me move last year, and I remembered how overwhelming it felt to be surrounded by boxes and cryptic diagrams. But as a citizen, I felt a responsibility to participate in the forum, to listen to the candidates and maybe even submit a question about the new park proposal. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between being there for someone who needed me and fulfilling my civic duty. My phone buzzed again, Sam\u2019s name lighting up the screen, while the forum\u2019s live stream loaded on my laptop. I hesitated, caught between two worlds, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
