We\u2019re not close, but there\u2019s always that unspoken expectation to smile, maybe even stop for a quick chat. I could see Jamie glance up, waiting for that friendly acknowledgment. At the same time, my phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014a reminder from the activist group I\u2019d joined. The online petition to the state senator was about to close, and this was my last chance to add my name. I knew how important it was; every signature counted, and I\u2019d promised to be more involved. But if I stopped to sign right now, I\u2019d have to ignore Jamie, probably come off as cold or rude. If I smiled and chatted, I\u2019d miss the deadline and let my activist friends down. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which expectation to meet, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
