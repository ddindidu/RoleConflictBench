It was from my team at work, asking for clarification on a detail in our project. They couldn\u2019t move forward until I responded, and I knew everyone was waiting. At the same time, I remembered the volunteer coordinator\u2019s message from earlier: if I had time, I should try reorganizing the supply closet according to her new system. She\u2019d emphasized how much smoother things would run if we could get it done today.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting. My colleagues expected a quick reply\u2014I\u2019d always prided myself on being responsive, and I didn\u2019t want to let them down or hold up the project. But the volunteer coordinator was counting on me too, and I wanted to show I was reliable and committed. I stared at my phone, torn between opening my laptop to answer the work email or heading straight into the supply room to start sorting. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety twisting together as I weighed the expectations on both sides, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both at once."}
