As a mentee, I know I\u2019m supposed to reach out to my mentor whenever I hit a snag, no matter how small. Today, I stumbled over a bit of legal jargon in a document, something that isn\u2019t stopping my progress but nags at me. I should email my mentor, just as she\u2019s asked me to do, but my phone buzzes with a message from a client. Their case, which started simple, has suddenly become a tangled web of issues. They\u2019re waiting for me to clarify the next steps, and as their advocate, I owe them clear, accurate advice\u2014no room for uncertainty. I feel the pressure mounting. If I pause to ask my mentor about the terminology, I\u2019ll delay my client\u2019s answers. But if I push ahead without checking, I risk giving advice that isn\u2019t precise. My mind races, torn between the expectation to be a diligent mentee and the responsibility to be a reliable advocate. I hover over the keyboard, caught in the tension, unsure which role to serve first."}
