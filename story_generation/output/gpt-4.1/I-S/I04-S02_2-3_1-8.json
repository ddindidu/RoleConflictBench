On one line, it was Jamie, my best friend, her voice trembling as she asked, \u201cDo you have a minute? I really need to talk.\u201d I could hear the strain in her words, the kind that only comes after a fight with someone you love. I knew what she needed\u2014someone to listen, to reassure her, to be present. But before I could answer, my other phone lit up with a call from the news network. The producer\u2019s message was urgent: \u201cWe need you on air now to address the misinformation spreading about our cause. It\u2019s critical.\u201d I felt my chest tighten. As an activist, I\u2019d promised to be available, to speak up when it mattered most. The community was counting on me to set the record straight, to educate and protect our movement. But Jamie was counting on me, too, in a way that felt just as important. I stared at both screens, heart pounding, torn between the friend who needed my comfort and the cause that needed my voice."}
