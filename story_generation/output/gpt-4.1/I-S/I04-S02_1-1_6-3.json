I glance down and see a message from Jamie, my closest friend, asking, \u201cWait, where are we meeting again?\u201d I know Jamie gets anxious when plans are unclear, and I promised I\u2019d always be straightforward to avoid misunderstandings.

Add your name to the petition before it\u2019s sent to the senator!\u201d I\u2019ve spent weeks rallying for this policy change, and my signature could make a difference.
