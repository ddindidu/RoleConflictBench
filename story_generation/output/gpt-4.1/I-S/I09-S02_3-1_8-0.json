She\u2019s already left for her trip, and she\u2019s counting on me to keep an eye out for her packages, especially with the power outage scheduled for tomorrow. I promised her I\u2019d help, and I know how much she worries about her deliveries getting lost or stolen. At the same time, my activist group\u2019s chat is buzzing\u2014Jules is live-streaming from the city square, where a protest is just starting. The turnout is small, and she\u2019s asking for backup, saying our presence could make a real difference. I feel the familiar tug between my roles: the reliable neighbor who keeps the building community strong, and the committed activist who stands up for what matters. Both expect me to show up, to be present, to care. I pace my living room, torn between the quiet responsibility of watching over Mrs. Lee\u2019s apartment and the urgent call to action echoing from my phone. My heart pounds as I weigh the trust she\u2019s placed in me against the cause I believe in, knowing I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
