Our team meeting was scheduled to start in fifteen minutes, and I knew this one was crucial\u2014our manager had made it clear that today\u2019s updates wouldn\u2019t be shared in an email or recorded. As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute, and to show my commitment to the project. But as I checked my phone, a reminder popped up: today was election day. The polling station was open all day, and my workload was light, so there was no real excuse to put it off. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, and I knew how important it was to participate. Yet, the meeting overlapped with the time I\u2019d planned to go, and I felt torn. If I skipped the meeting, I\u2019d let my team down and miss out on vital information. If I delayed voting, I worried something might come up later, and I\u2019d lose my chance. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations\u2014responsible colleague or responsible citizen?
