I smiled and greeted her, as always, exchanging a few friendly words. That\u2019s what good neighbors do\u2014keep things pleasant, make the building feel like home. Suddenly, the building\u2019s alarm blared, echoing off the walls. My phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning; outside, water was already pooling along the curb. As a citizen, I knew what was expected: follow emergency protocols, help others, make sure everyone was safe. But Mrs. Lee looked at me, her face pale, clearly frightened and unsure what to do. I felt torn\u2014should I stay calm and neighborly, reassuring her with a smile, or should I urge her to hurry, maybe even leave her groceries behind, and get to safety? The urge to help clashed with the need to keep things friendly and not cause panic. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, caught between the comfort of daily routine and the urgent call to act for the greater good."}
