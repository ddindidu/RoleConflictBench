It was Jamie, my oldest friend, her voice trembling through the speaker. Her car had broken down on the highway, miles from anywhere, and she was scared, stranded in the dark. She needed me\u2014now. My heart twisted; I could hear the panic in her voice, and I knew she had no one else to call. As her friend, I was supposed to be there, no questions asked, especially in moments like this.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, anxiety surged. The hearing tomorrow was at dawn, and my presence was non-negotiable. The client\u2019s future depended on my preparation and punctuality. Missing it wasn\u2019t an option; the stakes were too high, and my reputation as an advocate was on the line. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. Jamie\u2019s voice echoed in my mind, but so did the silent expectations of my client and the court. My hands shook as I stared at my phone, caught between loyalty and duty, not knowing which call to answer."}
