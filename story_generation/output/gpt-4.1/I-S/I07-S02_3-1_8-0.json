I glance at the clock. I have a few minutes before my next meeting, but my phone vibrates again. This time, it\u2019s a message from Maya, a fellow activist. She\u2019s live-streaming from a demonstration downtown, her voice tense: \u201cWe need more people here. If you\u2019re free, please come.\u201d I feel the familiar tug in my chest. I promised myself I\u2019d show up more, not just plan from behind a screen. But I also know my team is counting on me to be reliable, to keep things moving smoothly. My fingers hover over the keyboard, torn between typing a quick, professional reply and grabbing my coat to rush out the door. The weight of both expectations presses down on me, and I can\u2019t ignore the growing knot of anxiety in my stomach."}
