She often sits there to catch a breeze, especially during these heat waves. As her neighbor, I know how much she relies on that spot, and I\u2019ve always tried to be considerate, respecting her need for comfort and a bit of company in the hallway. But today, the HOA is doing their inspection, and anything left in the corridor could be cited for blocking the emergency exit. I\u2019m expected to keep shared spaces clear and safe.\n\nAt the same time, the city has issued a heat advisory. As a responsible citizen, I feel a duty to look out for vulnerable members of the community, especially someone like Mrs. Patel who lives alone and might struggle in this weather. I know the risks of heatstroke for the elderly. I stand in the hallway, torn between the HOA\u2019s rules and my responsibility to help a neighbor in need. My mind races with the possible consequences of either action, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
