I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss voting this year. As I hurried down the hallway, I ran into Mark, an acquaintance from work. He stopped me, his voice low. \u201cDid you hear about Lisa\u2019s latest project? Total disaster. She\u2019s really slipping.\u201d I felt a jolt of discomfort. As an acquaintance, I tried to avoid gossip, never wanting to speak ill of others or encourage negativity. But Mark was waiting for my response, eyebrows raised, expecting me to agree or at least listen. Meanwhile, the clock was ticking, and the polling station was just down the street. If I stayed to chat, I might miss my chance to vote. If I brushed him off, I risked seeming rude or unsupportive. My mind raced, torn between my responsibility as a voter and my desire to be a considerate acquaintance, the pressure of both roles squeezing my chest as I stood frozen in the hallway."}
