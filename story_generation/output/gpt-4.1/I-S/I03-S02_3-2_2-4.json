His eyes are red, his voice barely a whisper as he talks about his father, gone so suddenly. I want to hold him, to be the anchor he needs, to listen and let him cry. My phone buzzes on the coffee table. I glance at the screen\u2014unknown number, but I know who it is. The legislative aide I\u2019ve been trying to reach for weeks. This is the moment to push for the bill, to make my case, to be the voice for so many who need change. I feel my heart pounding, torn between the weight of his grief and the urgency of the call. He squeezes my hand, searching for comfort, and I feel the phone vibrate again. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My chest tightens as I wrestle with the impossible choice: be the girlfriend he needs, or the activist I promised to be."}
