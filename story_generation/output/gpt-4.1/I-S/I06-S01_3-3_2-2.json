My mentor\u2019s email blinked on my screen, reminding me that the project summary needed to be finished before tomorrow\u2019s evaluation. I knew how much she was counting on me\u2014she\u2019d even said this assignment would show upper management my potential. I wanted to prove myself, to not let her down. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in thirty minutes. I was the only one scheduled to open the community center tonight, and people would already be waiting outside, some of them relying on the warm meal we served. If I didn\u2019t show up on time, the doors would stay locked, and the service wouldn\u2019t start. I felt pulled in two directions, the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest. I imagined my mentor\u2019s disappointment if I missed the deadline, and the faces of the people outside the center if I didn\u2019t arrive. My hands trembled as I tried to focus, but the expectations from both sides tangled in my mind, making it impossible to breathe."}
