It was Mia, my girlfriend, texting about our weekend plans. She thought I\u2019d promised to spend Saturday with her, but I\u2019d mentioned the demonstration weeks ago. Her messages grew sharper, frustration seeping through every word. I knew I should call her, talk it out, resolve the misunderstanding before it grew into something bigger. That\u2019s what a good boyfriend does\u2014communicates, listens, makes things right.\n\nBut the crowd around me surged forward, voices rising. Someone beside me, a friend from the group, nudged my arm and pointed at the barricade ahead. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s show them we mean business,\u201d he urged, already stepping over the line onto the restricted city property. I hesitated, heart pounding. As a citizen, I knew the law was clear\u2014respect boundaries, don\u2019t trespass, don\u2019t damage public property. But the energy of the protest was infectious, and the pressure to join in was real.\n\nMy phone buzzed again. Mia\u2019s name flashed on the screen. I felt torn, pulled between the need to be there for her and the expectations of the crowd, between my role as a boyfriend and my responsibility as a citizen."}
