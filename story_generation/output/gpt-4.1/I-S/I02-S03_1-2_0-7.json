She barely looked up when I greeted her, and I could tell she\u2019d had a rough day at work.

But as I set my bag down, my phone buzzed with a community alert: a severe heat advisory had been issued, and I remembered Mrs. Lee, our elderly neighbor, who lived alone just down the hall. The city had asked residents to check on vulnerable neighbors during the heatwave. I felt torn\u2014Mia needed me here, but Mrs. Lee might need me even more.
