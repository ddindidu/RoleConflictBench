My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the election. I grabbed my ID and rushed to the polling station, determined to fulfill my civic duty. But at the desk, the official frowned. \u201cThere\u2019s a registration mismatch. You\u2019ll need to fill out a provisional ballot form. We close in ten minutes.\u201d My heart pounded. The form looked long, and I\u2019d barely started the code. If I stayed, I\u2019d lose precious hours I needed for my assignment. If I left, I\u2019d miss my chance to vote. Both roles demanded my full attention, and I felt the weight of letting someone down\u2014my mentor, or my community. I stood frozen, pen in hand, torn between the expectations pressing in from both sides, wishing I could split myself in two."}
