It was Jamie, my closest friend, texting, \u201cRough day. Can you talk?\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words, and I knew she needed me to listen, to be present, to offer the comfort I always tried to give. But I was already running through the details of my client\u2019s case in my mind, preparing to represent them at a minor hearing. The stakes weren\u2019t high, but I still owed my client my full attention and best effort. I stared at Jamie\u2019s message, feeling the weight of her need for support, while the courtroom doors loomed ahead, demanding my focus and professionalism. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward the friend who counted on me, and the client who trusted me. I hesitated, phone in hand, caught between the urge to call Jamie and the responsibility to step inside and advocate."}
