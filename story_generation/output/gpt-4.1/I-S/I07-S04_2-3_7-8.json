The election official\u2019s voice is calm but firm: \u201cYou\u2019ll need to finish this before we close in ten minutes.\u201d I nod, heart pounding, but my mind is split. Back at work, my team is waiting for my response to a crucial email\u2014without my clarification, the project stalls. I can almost picture their anxious faces, refreshing their inboxes, expecting me to reply within minutes as always. But here, as a voter, I\u2019m told to focus, to follow every instruction exactly, no distractions allowed. My fingers itch to check my phone, to dash off a quick message, but the official\u2019s eyes are on me, and the clock is ticking. I feel the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention, each with consequences if I fail. My chest tightens as I wrestle with what to do next, torn between my duty to my colleagues and my responsibility as a citizen."}
