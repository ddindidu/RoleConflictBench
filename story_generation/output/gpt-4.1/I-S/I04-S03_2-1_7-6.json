I could tell right away from their reply that they\u2019d misunderstood my last text\u2014my joke had come off as cold, and now Jamie sounded genuinely hurt. I knew I should call immediately, clear things up, and reassure them. That\u2019s what a good friend does: communicate openly, especially when feelings are at stake.\n\nBut as I reached for my phone, I glanced at the stack of tax documents on my desk. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d get them sorted today, a month ahead of the deadline, so I could volunteer at the free vaccine clinic this weekend. The community center needed all the help it could get, and I felt a responsibility to contribute\u2014paying taxes on time, helping out, doing my part as a citizen.\n\nMy heart pounded as I weighed the phone in my hand. Jamie needed me now, but so did my community. I felt torn, the expectations of friendship and citizenship pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my immediate attention. I sat there, caught between the urge to dial Jamie\u2019s number and the duty to finish my paperwork, wrestling with the impossible choice."}
