My partner lay curled up beside me, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs. She had just lost her father, and I could feel her pain radiating through the room. I wanted nothing more than to hold her, to be the steady presence she needed, to listen and comfort her through the night. But my phone kept vibrating\u2014my client\u2019s name flashing on the screen. He was in the middle of a legal crisis, and he needed my guidance now. If I didn\u2019t answer, he might make a costly mistake. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions. My partner needed me to be present, to show her she wasn\u2019t alone in her grief. My client needed me to be sharp, focused, and available. I stared at the phone, my mind racing, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing down on me, unsure which role to step into next."}
