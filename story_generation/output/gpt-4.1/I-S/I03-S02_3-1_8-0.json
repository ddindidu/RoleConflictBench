My boyfriend\u2019s voice is still echoing in the room, sharp and wounded from our argument. We\u2019ve never fought like this before, and now he\u2019s in the kitchen, the silence between us thick and heavy. I know he expects me to go to him, to talk things through, to prove that I care enough to fight for us. But my phone screen lights up again\u2014a message from Maya, a fellow activist. She\u2019s at the protest downtown, her text urgent: \u201cWe need more people. Can you come?\u201d I see her live-stream, the crowd small but determined, their voices carrying the cause we\u2019ve worked so hard for. My heart pounds. I want to be there, to stand with them, to not let them down. But I also want to fix what\u2019s breaking here, to not let him down. The weight of both worlds presses on me, and I feel myself pulled in two, unable to move, unable to choose."}
