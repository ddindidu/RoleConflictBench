It was Mark, an old college acquaintance who\u2019d recently moved to town. \u201cHey, do you know any good restaurants nearby?\u201d he texted. As an acquaintance, I felt I should help him settle in, maybe even join him for a meal. I started typing out a few suggestions, thinking about which places had the best food and atmosphere.\n\nBut then, I remembered the heat advisory that had been issued this morning. The news had warned everyone to check on vulnerable neighbors, especially the elderly. Mrs. Lee, who lived alone down the hall, came to mind. As a responsible citizen, I knew I should check on her, maybe bring her some cold water or help her set up her fan. The city\u2019s message was clear: look out for each other, especially during emergencies.\n\nI stared at my phone, torn. Mark was waiting for my reply, and I didn\u2019t want to let him down. But the thought of Mrs. Lee alone in her apartment, possibly struggling with the heat, gnawed at me. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing in, unsure which role I should fulfill first."}
