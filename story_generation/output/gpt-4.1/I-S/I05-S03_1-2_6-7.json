She\u2019d been missing deadlines, her voice tight with stress when we spoke. As her mentor, I felt responsible for guiding her, helping her find balance and grow. I\u2019d planned to call her at lunch, to talk through strategies for time management and offer support. Just as I reached for my phone, an alert flashed on my screen: a severe heat advisory. I remembered Mrs. Patel, my elderly neighbor, who lived alone two doors down. The city urged everyone to check on vulnerable residents, to ensure their safety in the sweltering heat. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in\u2014Maya needed me to be present and encouraging, but Mrs. Patel might need immediate help, maybe even a trip to a cooling center. My mind raced, torn between the promise I\u2019d made to Maya and my responsibility as a citizen to look out for those in my community. I stared at my phone, heart pounding, caught between two urgent calls for care."}
