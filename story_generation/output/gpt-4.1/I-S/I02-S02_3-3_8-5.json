My girlfriend\u2019s voice still echoes in my mind\u2014her words sharp, her eyes red from crying. We\u2019ve never fought like this before, and now she\u2019s questioning if we should even be together. I know I need to stay, to listen, to fix this. That\u2019s what a good boyfriend does. But then my phone buzzes again: a message from my activist group. The vote is happening now, earlier than anyone expected. The undecided representative is taking calls for the next hour, and my voice could tip the scales on a policy I\u2019ve spent months fighting for. My girlfriend\u2019s sobs come from the other room. My activist friends are counting on me. I feel split in two, the weight of both worlds pressing down on my chest. I can\u2019t be in both places at once, and I know that whatever I choose, something important will be left behind."}
