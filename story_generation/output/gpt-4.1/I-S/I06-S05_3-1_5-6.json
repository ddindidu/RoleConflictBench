My heart pounded as I glanced at the email from my mentor, asking for updates on my project. The truth was, my teammates and I had hit a wall\u2014misunderstandings and disagreements had escalated, and now our deliverable was at risk. As a mentee, I knew I should reach out, explain the situation, and ask for guidance. But the advocacy meetings were non-negotiable; punctuality was expected, and missing even one could undermine my credibility and the trust others placed in me. The meetings were scheduled so often that I barely had time to breathe, let alone draft a thoughtful message to my mentor or find a quiet moment to reflect on the conflict. I felt torn, the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I prioritized one, I\u2019d be letting the other down. My mind raced, anxiety building as I tried to figure out how to meet everyone\u2019s expectations\u2014except, at this moment, I couldn\u2019t see a way to do it all."}
