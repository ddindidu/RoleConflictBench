My girlfriend\u2019s voice trembles on the phone, \u201cI just wish you\u2019d told me sooner about your plans.\u201d The misunderstanding about our weekend has spiraled into a tense silence. As her boyfriend, I know I should stay, talk it through, and reassure her\u2014she expects me to resolve things, not leave her hanging. But my wallet, with my ID, is in my car, and the polling station closes in less than an hour. This is my only chance to vote, and I can\u2019t do it without the ID. The weight of civic duty presses on me; I promised myself I\u2019d never miss an election. But her voice, hurt and uncertain, tugs at me. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My mind races, torn between the responsibility to my relationship and my obligation as a voter. I pace the room, phone in hand, feeling the pressure mount with every passing minute."}
