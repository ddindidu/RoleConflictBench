As an acquaintance, I felt the familiar tug to approach, to offer a smile and gentle conversation, to help her feel at ease. That\u2019s what people expected of me: to be warm, to draw others in, to make the unfamiliar less daunting. But my phone buzzed in my pocket, a reminder of the trial tomorrow. As an advocate, my client\u2019s fate rested on my preparation, my focus, my ability to anticipate every argument. I was expected to be sharp, unwavering, and wholly committed. The weight of that responsibility pressed on me, making every minute away from my notes feel like a betrayal. I glanced at the nervous newcomer, then at my phone, feeling the tension coil inside me. I wanted to be present, to be kind, but my mind was already in the courtroom, rehearsing lines, strategizing. The demands of both roles pulled me in opposite directions, and I stood there, caught between the urge to reach out and the need to retreat."}
