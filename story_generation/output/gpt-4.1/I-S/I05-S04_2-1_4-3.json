My team was counting on me to guide them through the final steps before tomorrow\u2019s project deadline. I\u2019d promised them a clear, structured session\u2014no distractions, just focused learning. As I rehearsed my opening, my phone buzzed with a reminder: today was voting day. I\u2019d planned to go after work, but a news alert flashed\u2014lines were growing, and some polling stations were closing early. I checked my wallet. My usual ID was missing, but I had a backup at home. If I left now, I could fetch it and vote, but I\u2019d have to cancel or rush the session. My mentees needed me; they\u2019d prepared questions and were anxious about the project. But voting was my civic duty, and I\u2019d told myself I\u2019d never miss an election. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of being a reliable mentor and a responsible voter. I stared at the clock, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully satisfy both at once."}
