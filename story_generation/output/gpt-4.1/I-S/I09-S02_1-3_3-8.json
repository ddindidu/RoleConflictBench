As a neighbor, I always try to be considerate\u2014no one likes overflowing bins or trash blowing into their yard. I hesitated, thinking maybe I should wait and see if anyone else needed space. Just then, my phone buzzed. It was the news network, asking if I could go on air immediately to address a wave of misinformation about our cause. As an activist, I know how important it is to respond quickly and set the record straight, especially when the whole community is watching. But if I rush off now, I\u2019ll leave the bins half-empty, and my neighbors might think I\u2019m not pulling my weight. If I wait to see if anyone else needs the space, I might miss my chance to speak up for what I believe in. My heart pounded as I stood in the driveway, torn between being the neighbor everyone can count on and the activist my community needs."}
