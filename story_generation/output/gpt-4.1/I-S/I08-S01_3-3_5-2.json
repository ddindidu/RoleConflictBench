It was Jamie, an old acquaintance, her voice shaky. \u201cMy car broke down on Maple Road. Can you help? I don\u2019t know who else to call.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014fifteen minutes until I was supposed to unlock the community center. I was the only volunteer scheduled this morning, and I knew people would already be waiting outside, counting on me to open up and start the breakfast service. But Jamie sounded desperate, stranded on a quiet road with no one else to turn to. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down on me: the urge to help a friend in need, and the responsibility to the people who relied on the center. My mind raced, torn between the guilt of letting down the waiting crowd and the worry of leaving Jamie alone. I stood frozen in my hallway, keys in hand, heart pounding, unable to move in either direction."}
