The elevator doors opened, and there stood Mrs. Kim, my neighbor from down the hall, along with a few other residents. Their faces were tense, and I remembered the email about the noise complaint. Mrs. Kim smiled tightly and gestured for me to join them. \u201cWe just want to talk for a minute,\u201d she said, her voice polite but firm. I knew the expectation: as a neighbor, I should be friendly, listen, and help keep the peace. But my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014my volunteer shift started in ten minutes, and the coordinator had stressed how important it was to be on time today. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing on me, my heart pounding as I tried to decide whether to stay and be the good neighbor everyone expected, or rush out and fulfill my commitment to the volunteer team."}
