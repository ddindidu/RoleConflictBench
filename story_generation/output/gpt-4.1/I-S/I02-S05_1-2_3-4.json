She\u2019d been excited, texting me ideas for our date nights, and I could almost hear her laughter as I read her messages. We hadn\u2019t had this much free time together in months, and I knew how much it meant to her\u2014and to us. But then my phone buzzed with an email from the office: my client\u2019s case, the one with the high stakes and endless paperwork, had a sudden development. The hearing was moved up, and I\u2019d need to spend every spare moment preparing if I wanted to represent them well. My mind spun with the weight of both worlds\u2014Lisa\u2019s hopeful anticipation, my client\u2019s trust in my advocacy. I felt the pressure building, torn between being the boyfriend Lisa deserved and the advocate my client needed. My heart ached as I tried to figure out how to be both, knowing that no matter what I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
