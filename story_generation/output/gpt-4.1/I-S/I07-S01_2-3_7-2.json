The subject line read, \u201cUrgent: Need Clarification Before Proceeding.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014if I didn\u2019t leave now, I\u2019d be late unlocking the community center, where a small crowd would already be waiting for breakfast service. As the only volunteer scheduled this morning, everyone depended on me to open the doors and get things started. But my team at work was also waiting; they couldn\u2019t move forward on our project until I responded. I could picture my colleagues refreshing their inboxes, growing frustrated with the delay. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: be a reliable teammate, or be the dependable volunteer the community counted on. I stood frozen in my hallway, phone in hand, torn between two places I needed to be at once."}
