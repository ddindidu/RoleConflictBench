My boyfriend\u2019s last message is curt\u2014he\u2019s upset that I forgot our brunch plans for Saturday. He wants to talk now, to clear the air before it festers. I know how important it is to him that we resolve things quickly, that I don\u2019t just brush off his feelings. But as I type out an apology, another notification pops up: a fellow activist is live-streaming from the city square. The turnout is small, and she\u2019s asking for backup. I promised the group I\u2019d be there whenever I could, especially when numbers are low. My heart pounds as I picture her standing there, holding a sign, hoping for support. I want to be the reliable partner who listens and fixes things, but I also want to be the committed activist who shows up when it matters. My fingers hover over the keyboard, caught between two conversations, two worlds, and I can feel the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
