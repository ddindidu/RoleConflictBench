It\u2019s Jamie, frantic\u2014she\u2019s halfway to the airport and thinks she left her passport on her kitchen table. \u201cCan you check and bring it if it\u2019s there? I\u2019ll miss my flight otherwise,\u201d she pleads. I glance at the clock. The petition deadline is in ten minutes, and I\u2019ve spent weeks rallying people to sign. My signature, as the local organizer, is expected\u2014my absence would be noticed, maybe even questioned. But Jamie is my oldest friend, and she\u2019s counting on me to come through in her emergency. My heart pounds as I picture her panicking at the airport, and at the same time, I imagine the petition going out without my name, my commitment to the cause suddenly in doubt. I stand frozen in my hallway, keys in one hand, laptop open on the table, torn between the urgent needs of a friend and the pressing demands of my activism."}
