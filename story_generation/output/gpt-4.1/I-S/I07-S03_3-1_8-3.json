They\u2019re waiting.\u201d As a colleague, I knew how important it was to respond quickly\u2014leadership was counting on me to keep things moving smoothly. I opened my laptop, ready to reply, when I noticed the city newsletter in my inbox. The subject line caught my eye: \u201cHelp shape your bus routes\u2014survey closes soon!\u201d As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to participate, especially since I relied on those buses every day. The survey would only take a few minutes, but so would the email. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014my team needed me to be responsive, but my community needed my input, too. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, torn between the urgent ping of my work and the quiet call of civic duty. I stared at the screen, heart pounding, knowing I couldn\u2019t do both at once."}
