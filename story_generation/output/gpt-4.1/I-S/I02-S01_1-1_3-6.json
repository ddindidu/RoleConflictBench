I\u2019m free all week, so whatever works for you.\u201d I smiled, thinking about how we\u2019d both been looking forward to some real time together. We\u2019d promised each other we\u2019d make it happen this week, no matter what. Then, as I scrolled through my emails, I saw a new message from the volunteer coordinator. She\u2019d written, \u201cIf you have any extra time this week, could you try reorganizing the supply closet? It\u2019s not urgent, but it would really help us out.\u201d I knew she trusted me to handle things, and I wanted to show I was reliable. But now, every evening I considered for a date with Mia, I felt a tug of guilt\u2014shouldn\u2019t I use that time to help out at the center? I could almost hear both voices in my head: Mia\u2019s excitement, the coordinator\u2019s hopeful request. I sat there, torn, feeling the weight of wanting to be the boyfriend Mia deserved and the volunteer the center needed."}
