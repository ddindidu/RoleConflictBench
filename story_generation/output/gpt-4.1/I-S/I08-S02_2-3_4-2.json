We\u2019d planned for weeks, and today was crucial\u2014our voices needed to be heard. As I grabbed my bag, another message popped up, this time from Mark, an old classmate. \u201cHey, could you help me move some boxes this afternoon? I\u2019m really stuck.\u201d I hesitated. Mark didn\u2019t have many friends in the city, and I knew he\u2019d helped me out before. As an acquaintance, I felt I should be there for him, especially since he rarely asked for favors.\n\nBut then, another alert: the police had started blocking the exits at the protest. Panic was spreading in our group chat. As an activist, I was expected to help coordinate a safe response, to make sure no one got hurt or trapped. My heart pounded as I stared at my phone, torn between the immediate need to support my friend and the urgent responsibility to my fellow activists. Both sides needed me, and I could feel the weight of their expectations pressing in, demanding a choice I wasn\u2019t ready to make."}
