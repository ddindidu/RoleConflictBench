I smiled, ready to offer my usual gentle nudge, but my phone buzzed urgently. The news network\u2019s producer was on the line\u2014there was a breaking story misrepresenting our cause, and they needed me on air, now, to set the record straight. My heart pounded. As a mentor, I wanted to give Jamie my full attention, to help them weigh their options thoughtfully. But as an activist, I felt the weight of my community\u2019s trust, the expectation to speak up and educate the public before misinformation spread further. Jamie looked at me, waiting, and I felt the tug-of-war inside me\u2014torn between the quiet guidance I owed one person and the loud, immediate call to defend the truth for many."}
