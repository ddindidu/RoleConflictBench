In my inbox, a string of messages from my team grows longer\u2014everyone is waiting for my clarification on a key detail before they can move forward with our project. I know they\u2019re counting on me to respond quickly, to keep things moving. At the same time, my activist group\u2019s latest post is exploding online. This is the moment we\u2019ve been waiting for\u2014thousands of people are reading, sharing, asking questions. If I jump in now, I can steer the conversation, answer doubts, and maybe even inspire real change. But every second I spend crafting the perfect comment is a second my colleagues are left hanging, their work stalled. My mind races, torn between the urgent pull of my team\u2019s expectations and the rare, fleeting chance to make a difference for my cause. My fingers hover over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I try to decide which part of myself to answer first."}
