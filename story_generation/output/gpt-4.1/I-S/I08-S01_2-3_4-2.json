I\u2019m really in a bind.\u201d I knew he didn\u2019t have many people to call on, and I\u2019d always believed in being there for others when they needed a hand. That\u2019s what friends\u2014or even acquaintances\u2014do, right? But as I typed out a reply, my eyes flicked to the clock. My volunteer shift at the community food pantry started in less than an hour. I was the only one scheduled to open up today, and I knew people would already be waiting outside, counting on me to unlock the doors and get things started. The thought of letting them down made my stomach twist. I wanted to help Mark, but I also couldn\u2019t bear the idea of leaving those families standing in the cold. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to support someone who\u2019d reached out and the responsibility I\u2019d committed to as a volunteer. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which way to turn."}
