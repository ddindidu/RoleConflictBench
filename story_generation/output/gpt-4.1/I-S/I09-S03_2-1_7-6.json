Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, lives alone just down the hall. I know she relies on me for small things\u2014picking up her mail, checking in when the weather turns bad. Tonight, she might need help if the power goes out or if she gets anxious. At the same time, the city is running a free vaccine clinic this weekend, and as a responsible citizen, I feel compelled to volunteer. I\u2019ve also set aside this weekend to organize my tax documents, something I promised myself I\u2019d do early this year. The community expects people like me to step up, especially during emergencies, but Mrs. Lee\u2019s well-being tugs at me too. I feel torn\u2014should I stay close to home in case she needs me, or head to the clinic to help the wider community? The weight of both roles presses on me, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
