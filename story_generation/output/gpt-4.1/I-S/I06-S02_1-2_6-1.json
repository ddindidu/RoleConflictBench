My mentor\u2019s office hours are now, and she\u2019s made it clear how important it is to use this time wisely\u2014she\u2019s busy, and I\u2019m lucky she\u2019s set aside these hours for me. I promised I\u2019d show up, prepared with questions, ready to learn. But outside, the crowd is gathering, banners waving, voices rising. The protest march is about to start, and I\u2019m supposed to be at the front, leading the first chant. People are counting on me to set the tone, to show up for the cause I care so deeply about. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, torn between the quiet, expectant office and the pulsing energy outside. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. I feel the weight of my mentor\u2019s trust and the hope of the activists pressing down on me, each demanding my presence, each certain their cause is the one I should choose. My hands tremble as I try to decide which door to walk through."}
