She was waiting for my call, anxious for my advice on whether to accept a job that could shape her entire career. I knew she depended on my structured guidance, and I had promised to walk her through every detail. Just as I reached for the phone, an alert flashed on my screen: a severe heat advisory. I remembered Mrs. Lee, my elderly neighbor, who lived alone and sometimes forgot to turn on her air conditioner. As a responsible citizen, I felt compelled to check on her, maybe bring her some water, make sure she was safe. But my mentee\u2019s future was hanging in the balance, and she was expecting my undivided attention right now. My mind raced, torn between the duty to guide someone at a pivotal moment and the responsibility to look after a vulnerable member of my community. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I found myself frozen, heart pounding, unable to choose which role to fulfill first."}
