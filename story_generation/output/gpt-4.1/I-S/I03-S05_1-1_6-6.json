Why didn\u2019t you tell me about your meeting?\u201d The misunderstanding was small, but I could already sense the tension building. As his girlfriend, I knew he expected me to talk things through, to clear up confusion before it grew into something bigger. I wanted to call him, to explain, to smooth things over like I always did.\n\nBut my other phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for the firm\u2019s weekly case review. As an advocate, punctuality was non-negotiable. Missing even a routine meeting could mean lost trust, missed updates, or worse, a reprimand from my senior. I felt the pressure mounting from both sides: Alex needed reassurance and clarity, my team needed my presence and focus. My mind raced, torn between the urge to resolve things with Alex and the professional demand to show up, prepared and on time. The clock ticked, and I sat frozen, caught between the two worlds, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
