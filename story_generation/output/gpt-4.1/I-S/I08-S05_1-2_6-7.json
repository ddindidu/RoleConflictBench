The conversation quickly turned to the recent decisions made by our mutual colleague, Sarah. As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip or speaking negatively about others, but the group pressed for my opinion. I could feel their eyes on me, waiting for me to join in. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session for my client was starting soon, and as their advocate, I was expected to be punctual\u2014no excuses. My heart pounded as I glanced at the clock, realizing I was already cutting it close. The group\u2019s chatter grew louder, and I felt torn between staying silent and risking seeming aloof, or joining in and betraying my own values. Meanwhile, the weight of my professional responsibility pressed on me, knowing my client\u2019s case could be affected if I was late. I hesitated, caught between the demands of friendship and duty, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
