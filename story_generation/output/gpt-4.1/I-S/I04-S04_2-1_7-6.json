She\u2019d texted back, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that,\u201d and I could almost hear the hurt in her words. I know I need to call her right now, to explain that my message came out wrong, that I never meant to sound harsh. That\u2019s what friends do\u2014we talk things out, clear the air before things get worse.\n\nBut just as I\u2019m about to step aside and call, an election official\u2019s voice booms over the crowd: \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line on the left.\u201d My last name is right in the middle of that range. The new line is longer, barely moving, but the instructions are clear. As a voter, I\u2019m supposed to follow every direction, no exceptions. I glance at the official, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. My friend needs me, but so does the process. My heart pounds as I stand frozen, torn between the rules of democracy and the rules of friendship, not sure which to break."}
