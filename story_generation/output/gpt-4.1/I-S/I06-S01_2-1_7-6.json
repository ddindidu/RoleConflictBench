Only if you have time!\u201d I was already at the community center, sorting boxes, when my mentor\u2019s message buzzed in. She\u2019d managed to squeeze in a quick meeting for me\u2014just fifteen minutes, right now, before her next appointment. I knew how rare her free time was, and I didn\u2019t want to waste a second of it. But the supplies were half-sorted, and the coordinator\u2019s suggestion, though not urgent, felt like something I should do to show I was committed and attentive. I could feel the pressure mounting\u2014should I drop everything and rush to my mentor, or finish the task to prove myself as a reliable volunteer? My mind raced, torn between the desire to respect my mentor\u2019s time and the urge to meet the expectations of the volunteer coordinator."}
