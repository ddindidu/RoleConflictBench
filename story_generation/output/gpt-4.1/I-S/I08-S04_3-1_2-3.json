I wanted to make sure I followed the rules\u2014bring valid identification, vote responsibly, do my civic duty. As I rounded the corner, I saw Jamie, someone I knew from the neighborhood, sitting on a bench, shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. My instinct as an acquaintance was to stop, offer comfort, and be the friendly, approachable person I always tried to be. But the clock was ticking, and I was anxious about getting to the polls before the line grew. I could fetch another ID later if I needed, but the thought of missing my chance or causing myself more hassle gnawed at me. I hovered awkwardly, torn between the urge to sit beside Jamie and the pressure to keep moving.

I stood frozen, wrestling with the impossible choice, unsure which role I should let guide me."}
