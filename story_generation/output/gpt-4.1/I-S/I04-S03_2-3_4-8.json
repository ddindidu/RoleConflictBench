It was Sam, frantic and nearly in tears, convinced he\u2019d left his passport at home on his way to the airport. He begged me to check his apartment and, if I found it, rush it to him before his flight. As his friend, I knew how much this trip meant to him, and I couldn\u2019t imagine letting him down in such a crucial moment. I grabbed my keys, ready to dash out the door.\n\nBut just then, the city\u2019s emergency alert blared through my phone and the building\u2019s alarms. A flash-flood warning. Water was already pooling outside, and the authorities urged everyone to stay indoors and avoid the streets for our own safety and to keep roads clear for emergency vehicles. As a responsible citizen, I knew I should follow these instructions, not only for my own safety but for the well-being of the whole community.\n\nStanding in my hallway, keys in hand, I felt torn in two. My loyalty to Sam pulled me one way, while my duty to my neighbors and city pulled me another. My heart pounded as I weighed the risks and responsibilities, caught between being a good friend and a responsible citizen."}
