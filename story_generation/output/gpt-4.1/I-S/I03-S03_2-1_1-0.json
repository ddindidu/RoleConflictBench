He\u2019d just told me about the harsh feedback he got at work, and I could see the disappointment in his eyes. I wanted to do anything to make him feel better, to show him I was on his side. As we passed a bench, he crumpled up the coffee cup he\u2019d been holding and, without thinking, tossed it onto the grass. He kept walking, shoulders slumped, not even noticing the no-littering sign or the trash bin just a few steps away. My heart twisted. As his girlfriend, I wanted to let it go, to focus on comforting him and not make things worse. But as a citizen, I felt a responsibility to respect the park and the rules, to set an example and maybe even gently remind him. The two parts of me pulled in opposite directions, and I could feel the tension building inside, unsure which voice to listen to."}
