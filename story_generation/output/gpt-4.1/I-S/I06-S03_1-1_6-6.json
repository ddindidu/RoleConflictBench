My mentor had finally opened up office hours this week, a rare chance to get feedback on my project. I knew how busy she was, and she\u2019d made it clear: if I wanted her guidance, I needed to show up during these windows. I owed it to her\u2014and to myself\u2014not to waste this opportunity. But then, the email from the community center blinked on my screen: volunteers were needed for the free vaccine clinic this weekend. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to help, especially since I\u2019d already organized my tax documents and had the time. The city was counting on people like me to step up. I felt torn, guilt gnawing at me from both sides. If I skipped the clinic, I\u2019d feel selfish, but if I missed my mentor\u2019s office hours, I\u2019d be letting down someone who invested in my growth. My mind raced, heart pounding, as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both directions, unsure which role I owed more in this moment."}
