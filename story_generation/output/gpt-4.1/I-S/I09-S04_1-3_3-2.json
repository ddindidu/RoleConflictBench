I grab my coat, ready to dash out, when I notice the trash bins by the curb. My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, is struggling with her heavy bag, her own bin already full. She looks at me, hopeful.

My heart pounds as I weigh the options: be the good neighbor who helps, or the responsible voter who makes it in time. I can feel the pressure from both sides\u2014Mrs. Lee\u2019s silent plea, the civic duty tugging at me. I stand frozen, keys in one hand, the other reaching for the bin, torn between two roles that suddenly feel impossible to balance."}
