It was Sam, my oldest friend, his voice shaky and desperate. His car had broken down on the highway, miles from town, and he was stranded in the dark. \u201cCan you come get me? Please, I don\u2019t know who else to call,\u201d he pleaded. I could hear the panic in his voice, and I knew he wouldn\u2019t have asked unless it was serious. As his friend, I felt a deep responsibility to help him, especially in a moment like this.\n\nBut as I sat up, my eyes caught the suit I\u2019d laid out for the morning. I had a court session at 8 a.m.\u2014a crucial hearing for a client who was counting on me to be there, prepared and on time. Missing it or even arriving late could jeopardize their case and my reputation as an advocate. My mind raced, torn between the urgent need of my friend and the professional duty I owed my client. The weight of both expectations pressed down on me, and I felt paralyzed, caught between loyalty and obligation, unable to see a way to fulfill both."}
