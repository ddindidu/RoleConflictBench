I grab my coat and the voter card, ready to dash out the door. Just as I reach for the handle, I hear a gentle knock. It\u2019s Mrs. Kim from next door, holding a small cake, her eyes warm and expectant. I remember how I\u2019d planned to welcome her, to be the friendly neighbor everyone appreciates, especially since she\u2019s just moved in. She smiles, offering the cake, and I see the hope in her face for a quick chat, maybe even a cup of tea. But the thought of missing my chance to vote tugs at me. I know how important it is to participate, to have my voice heard. Yet, I also know how much it means to make someone feel at home. My mind spins, torn between the duty to my community as a voter and the kindness expected of me as a neighbor. I stand frozen, the seconds ticking away, caught between two doors\u2014one to civic responsibility, the other to human connection."}
