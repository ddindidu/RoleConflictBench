The first was from my friend, Sam, whose message was clipped and cold: \u201cDidn\u2019t expect that from you.\u201d My heart dropped. I scrolled up, rereading my earlier text\u2014meant as a joke, but I could see how it sounded harsh. I knew Sam, and I knew how much open communication mattered to our friendship. I needed to call, to explain, to fix this before the misunderstanding grew.\n\nBut the second notification was from my client, marked urgent. Their legal issue was time-sensitive, and they depended on me for clear, immediate advice. As their advocate, I couldn\u2019t let them down or risk their case by delaying my response. My mind raced, torn between the loyalty I owed my friend and the responsibility I had to my client. Both needed me, right now, and both expected me to be fully present for them. My hand hovered over my phone, my chest tight, as I tried to decide which call to make first."}
