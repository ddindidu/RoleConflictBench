My mentor had managed to squeeze in a rare fifteen-minute meeting for me between her back-to-back appointments. I knew how valuable her time was, and I\u2019d promised myself never to waste it. I\u2019d prepared my questions, rehearsed my updates, determined to make the most of every second. But as I opened my laptop, a notification flashed: the online candidate forum for my district was starting now. I\u2019d been waiting for this\u2014an opportunity to hear directly from those running for office, to ask questions, to be the kind of engaged citizen I believed in. I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I missed the forum, I\u2019d lose my chance to participate in shaping my community. If I rescheduled with my mentor, I might not get another chance for weeks. My mind raced, torn between my commitment to my mentor and my responsibility as a citizen, anxiety rising as I realized I couldn\u2019t fully honor both at once."}
