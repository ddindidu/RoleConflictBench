The poll worker politely asked me to re-sign, explaining it was necessary to ensure my vote would count. As a voter, I knew I should follow every instruction to keep the process fair and secure. Just then, my mentee, who happened to be volunteering at the polls, caught my eye and quietly asked, \u201cWhy do they need a new signature? Isn\u2019t that risky?\u201d \n\nAs a mentor, I felt the urge to explain\u2014share what I knew about election procedures and the importance of signature verification. But the rules were clear: voters shouldn\u2019t discuss ballot details or procedures inside the polling place. I could see the confusion on my mentee\u2019s face, and I wanted to help, to teach, to reassure. Yet, I also felt the weight of my responsibility as a voter to respect the process and not disrupt the flow. My mind raced, torn between the urge to guide and the need to comply, my heart pounding as I stood there, pen hovering over the envelope, caught between two roles I cared deeply about."}
