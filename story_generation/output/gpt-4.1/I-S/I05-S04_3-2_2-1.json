My mentee sat across from me, eyes wide with uncertainty, waiting for my advice on a job offer that could change her life. She needed clarity, a step-by-step plan, and the reassurance that only I could give. I wanted to be present, to listen, to guide her through every angle and consequence. But in the back of my mind, the reminder buzzed: the polling station would close in less than two hours, and I still had errands to finish. Civic duty tugged at me\u2014I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote, that my voice mattered. Yet here I was, torn between being the mentor she needed and the responsible citizen I aspired to be.
