My mentor\u2019s last message echoed in my mind: \u201cLet me know immediately if you hit any roadblocks.\u201d I had, in fact, hit a major one\u2014a technical glitch that threatened to derail my entire project. I knew I should text her right away, but the election official\u2019s voice cut through my thoughts: \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line.\u201d My last name started with B. The new line looked longer and slower, but the instructions were clear. I hesitated, torn. If I stayed put, I\u2019d be ignoring the official\u2019s directions, but if I moved, I\u2019d lose precious time to update my mentor and possibly miss her window to help. My chest tightened as I weighed the pressure to be a responsible mentee against my duty as a rule-abiding voter. Both roles demanded immediate action, but I couldn\u2019t see a way to satisfy them both at once."}
