My mentor, who squeezed me into her packed schedule, is waiting for our meeting in ten minutes. I know how much she values punctuality and preparation\u2014she\u2019s told me before that respect for her time is non-negotiable. But as I look up, the protest I helped organize is suddenly shifting. Police are blocking the exits, and panic is starting to ripple through the crowd. As an activist, I\u2019m expected to stay calm, help coordinate a safe response, and make sure everyone knows what to do. My friends are looking to me, shouting for guidance. I feel the weight of their trust, the urgency in their voices. My phone buzzes again\u2014a reminder for the meeting. I\u2019m torn, my mind racing between the obligation to my mentor and the responsibility to the people around me. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, but both roles demand my full attention right now. My chest tightens as I try to figure out what to do next."}
