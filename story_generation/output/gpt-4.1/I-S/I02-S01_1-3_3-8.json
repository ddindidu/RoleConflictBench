For once, both Mia and I had a few free evenings, and we\u2019d been talking about finally having a proper date night\u2014just the two of us, no distractions. She kept sending me ideas for places to go, and I could tell how much she wanted us to make the most of this rare opportunity. But then, just as I was about to text her back, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator. There was an urgent situation: new procedures had to be implemented immediately, and everyone was expected to help out, or the service might be shut down. The coordinator\u2019s words were clear\u2014no exceptions, no delays. I could feel the pressure mounting, torn between wanting to be the boyfriend Mia deserved and the volunteer my team needed. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety twisting together as I stared at my phone, caught between two worlds that suddenly felt impossible to balance."}
