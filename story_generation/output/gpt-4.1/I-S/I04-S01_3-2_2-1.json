It was Mia, her voice trembling as she told me her father had just been rushed to the hospital. She needed me\u2014someone to listen, to help her hold together the pieces of her world. I sat up, heart pounding, murmuring comfort, trying to be the friend she needed. But as I glanced at the clock, anxiety crept in. My volunteer shift at the shelter started at 6 a.m. sharp, and the coordinator had stressed how crucial it was for everyone to be on time today. We were already short-staffed, and the animals depended on us for their morning care. I could hear Mia\u2019s sobs through the phone, but in the back of my mind, I pictured the shelter doors opening, the expectant faces of the dogs, and the disappointment if I let the team down. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides, unsure how to be the friend Mia deserved and the volunteer the shelter needed."}
