As a citizen, I knew the rules\u2014respect the barricades, don\u2019t trespass, keep the peace. But then, in the swirl of voices, I spotted Jamie, an old acquaintance, weaving through the crowd toward me. Jamie\u2019s eyes darted nervously, and before I could greet him, he leaned in and whispered a secret about one of the protest organizers\u2014something personal, something that could ruin the organizer\u2019s reputation if it got out. I felt a jolt of discomfort. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t gossip or spread what I\u2019d just heard. But then, someone nearby shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s move past the barricade! Show them we won\u2019t be silenced!\u201d The crowd surged forward, and Jamie looked at me expectantly, as if waiting to see what I\u2019d do. I felt torn\u2014should I protect the organizer\u2019s privacy, or should I join the crowd and risk breaking the law? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something different, and I stood frozen, heart pounding, caught between loyalty and duty."}
