She was leaving for a week and asked if I could keep an eye out for her packages, especially since the building was scheduled for a power interruption. I assured her I\u2019d help, knowing how much she relies on me for these little things. Later, at the community center, I read an email from our volunteer coordinator. She suggested that, if I had extra time, I should reorganize the supply closet\u2014a task that would take hours, but would really help the team. I felt the weight of both requests. If I stayed late at the center, I might miss the delivery window for Mrs. Kim\u2019s package, especially with the power outage complicating things. But if I left early to be at her apartment, I\u2019d be letting down the coordinator and the other volunteers. I could feel the tension building inside me, torn between being a good neighbor and a reliable volunteer, both expecting my time and attention at the same moment."}
