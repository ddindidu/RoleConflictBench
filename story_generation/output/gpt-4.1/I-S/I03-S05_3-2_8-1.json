Our argument had spiraled, and now he was questioning if we should even be together. He wanted me to talk, to fight for us, to resolve this before it broke us apart. My heart ached, but my mind was already racing ahead\u2014my client\u2019s file lay open on my laptop, emails piling up.

I could hear the urgency in both voices\u2014one pleading for reassurance, the other for expertise. I felt split in two, the weight of their needs pressing down on me.
