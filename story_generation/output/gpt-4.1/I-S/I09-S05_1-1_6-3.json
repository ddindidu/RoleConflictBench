My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, asked me to receive it for her\u2014she\u2019s missed deliveries before, and I know how much she relies on me for these little things. It\u2019s what good neighbors do, right? But at the same time, I\u2019m scheduled to appear at a minor hearing for one of my clients. The case isn\u2019t high-stakes, but as their advocate, I\u2019m expected to show up, prepared and present, no matter how small the matter. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that if I let my client down, I\u2019m failing in my professional duty. Yet, if I leave Mrs. Lee hanging, I\u2019m not the neighbor I want to be. The clock ticks closer to the delivery window and the hearing time, and I feel the pressure mounting, torn between the quiet trust of my neighbor and the formal responsibility of my client. My phone buzzes with a reminder for the hearing, and I glance at the door, half-expecting the delivery truck to pull up any minute. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the weight of both roles presses in on me."}
