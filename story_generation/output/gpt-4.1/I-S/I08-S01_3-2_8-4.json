As I handed out forms, a woman I recognized from my neighborhood approached. She leaned in and, in a hushed voice, shared a personal concern about her family\u2019s struggles, trusting me to keep it private. I nodded, assuring her that her words would stay between us. Later, while taking a break, I ran into an old acquaintance who started chatting about neighborhood news. Suddenly, she mentioned the same woman, speculating about her situation. I realized I now held sensitive information that could confirm or deny the rumors. As an acquaintance, I felt pressure to avoid gossip and not speak negatively about others, but as a volunteer, I was bound to respect the privacy of those I helped. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I could feel my heart race as I tried to figure out what to say, knowing that any response could betray someone\u2019s trust or fuel harmful gossip."}
