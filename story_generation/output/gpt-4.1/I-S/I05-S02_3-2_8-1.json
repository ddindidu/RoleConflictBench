I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d Her project presentation is in an hour, and I know how much this means for her future. As her mentor, I promised to be there, to help her grow, to never let her feel alone in moments like this. But outside, the crowd is gathering, the energy palpable. As an activist, I\u2019m expected to lead the march, to be the voice at the front, to show unwavering commitment to the cause. The organizers are counting on me; the movement needs every leader it can get. My heart pounds as I weigh the hope in my mentee\u2019s message against the chants rising outside. I feel pulled in two directions, each role demanding my full presence, each expectation heavy with consequence. My hands tremble as I try to decide where I am needed most, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left behind."}
