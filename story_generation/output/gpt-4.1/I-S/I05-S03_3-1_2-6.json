I\u2019d planned to spend the weekend double-checking every form, making sure I contributed my fair share and followed the rules\u2014something I took seriously as a responsible citizen. But then my phone buzzed: my mentee, Sarah, was in crisis. She\u2019d just received a job offer that could change her life, but she had to decide by Monday. She needed my guidance now, not later. I could hear the anxiety in her voice, and I knew how much she depended on my support.\n\nAt the same time, the community center was hosting a free vaccine clinic this weekend, and volunteers were needed. I\u2019d promised to help, knowing how important it was for public health. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014Sarah\u2019s future in my hands, and my duty to my community calling. I felt torn, the expectations of mentor and citizen pulling me in opposite directions, each demanding my time and presence. My mind raced, heart heavy, as I tried to figure out how to be both the guide Sarah needed and the citizen my community expected."}
