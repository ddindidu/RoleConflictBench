The client\u2019s delivery is tomorrow, and my part of the project is the last piece holding everything together. My team is counting on me to finish by the end of the day, and I promised I would. But here I am, standing in a long line at the polling station, laptop in my bag, trying to do my civic duty. Suddenly, an official calls out, \u201cVoters with last names A through M, please move to the new line on the left!\u201d My last name starts with B. The new line is barely moving, while the original one is finally picking up speed. I know the rules: follow the officials\u2019 instructions. But every minute I spend here is a minute lost for my team, and the deadline is looming. My phone buzzes with a message from my manager: \u201cAny update?\u201d I feel torn\u2014do I obey the official and risk missing my deadline, or do I stay put and risk causing trouble at the polling station? My heart pounds as I weigh my responsibilities, caught between being a good colleague and a responsible voter."}
