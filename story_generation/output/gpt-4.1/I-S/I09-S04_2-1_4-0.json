As a neighbor, I always try to be considerate\u2014our building\u2019s walls are thin, and my dog, Max, has a habit of barking loudly whenever someone passes by our shared hallway. I know it annoys Mrs. Patel next door, who works nights and sleeps during the day. I usually time our walks to avoid the busiest hours, but today is election day, and I promised myself I\u2019d vote early. The polls are open all day, and my schedule is light, but I feel a responsibility to get there promptly, to set a good example and fulfill my civic duty.\n\nAs I clip on Max\u2019s leash, I hear footsteps outside. If I wait, I\u2019ll be late for my planned voting time. If I go now, Max will almost certainly bark and disturb the neighbors. My stomach knots as I stand by the door, torn between being a good neighbor and a responsible voter, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
