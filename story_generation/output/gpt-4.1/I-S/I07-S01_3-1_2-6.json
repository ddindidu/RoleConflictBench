The team meeting was in fifteen minutes\u2014the final discussion before we locked in decisions for the quarter. My manager expected everyone to be present, to contribute, to show commitment. I knew my input mattered, and I didn\u2019t want to let my colleagues down. But just as I was about to close my laptop and head to the conference room, my phone buzzed. The volunteer coordinator had emailed: \u201cIf you have time today, could you try organizing the supply closet by category instead of alphabetically? It might help us find things faster.\u201d I\u2019d promised to help at the shelter this afternoon, and the coordinator\u2019s suggestions always felt more like gentle orders than options. I could picture the cluttered shelves, the volunteers fumbling for supplies, and I wanted to do my part. But if I left now, I\u2019d miss the meeting\u2014and if I stayed, I\u2019d be letting down the shelter. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I sat frozen, torn between two places I was needed."}
