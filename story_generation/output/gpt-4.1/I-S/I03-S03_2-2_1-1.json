As his girlfriend, I wanted nothing more than to lift his spirits, to do something special for him. He\u2019d always loved our late-night music sessions\u2014just the two of us, singing along to his favorite songs, letting the world fade away. Tonight, it felt like he needed that comfort more than ever.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock, I realized it was already past ten. The building\u2019s quiet hours had started, and I could hear our neighbor\u2019s window open, the faint clatter of dishes drifting in. As a responsible citizen, I knew the rules were there for a reason\u2014everyone deserved peace in their own home. Yet, Alex\u2019s eyes met mine, silently pleading for a distraction, for a moment of joy in a rough day.\n\nMy heart twisted as I weighed my roles: the girlfriend who wanted to be his safe haven, and the citizen who respected the rights of those around me. I stood there, torn, the speaker in my hand, unsure which part of me should take the lead."}
