The leadership team needed my confirmation on a detail for an external partner, and I knew they expected a prompt reply. As a colleague, I prided myself on being responsive and reliable, never letting messages linger unanswered. But at that moment, I was sitting in a quiet courtroom, waiting for my client\u2019s minor hearing to begin. The stakes weren\u2019t high, but as their advocate, I owed them my full attention and respect. I glanced at the judge, then at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in. If I replied now, I\u2019d be distracted from my client\u2019s case; if I waited, I\u2019d risk letting my team down. My mind raced, torn between the immediate needs of my colleagues and my duty to represent my client effectively. The pressure built as I tried to decide which expectation to meet first, knowing that either choice would mean falling short somewhere."}
