As an activist, I knew this was the moment to educate, to add a comment that could reach thousands. But the most compelling example I had\u2014the one that would make people listen\u2014was something I\u2019d learned in confidence about someone I barely knew, an acquaintance from a mutual friend. I remembered the expectation: don\u2019t gossip, don\u2019t harm someone\u2019s reputation. Yet, the urge to use that story, to make the issue real and urgent, gnawed at me.
