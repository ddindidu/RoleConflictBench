It wasn\u2019t required, but I knew she\u2019d ask about it at our next meeting, and I wanted to show her I was committed. The reading was dense, and I\u2019d been putting it off, telling myself there was still time. As I handed a pen to the next person in line, she leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper, and shared something deeply personal about her situation. I nodded, listening, feeling the weight of her trust settle on my shoulders. I knew I had to keep her confidence, but my mind kept drifting to the reading I hadn\u2019t started. I wondered if I should mention this conversation to my mentor, who always encouraged me to reflect on my experiences, but I worried about betraying the client\u2019s trust. The expectations from both sides pressed in on me, and I felt torn, unsure how to honor both roles without letting someone down."}
