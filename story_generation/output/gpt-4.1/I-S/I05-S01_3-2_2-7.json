She was on the verge of a major decision, and I knew my role as her mentor was to provide clear, structured guidance\u2014help her weigh the pros and cons, anticipate the long-term impact, and support her in making the best choice for her future. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the volunteer coordinator\u2019s new safety protocols were to be implemented today, and I was expected to model strict adherence. The guidelines were clear\u2014no exceptions, no improvisation. Yet, my mentee\u2019s situation called for flexibility and nuanced advice, not rigid rules. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the responsibility to guide her thoughtfully and the obligation to follow the volunteer coordinator\u2019s instructions to the letter. My mind raced, caught between the urge to be the mentor she needed and the volunteer I was expected to be."}
