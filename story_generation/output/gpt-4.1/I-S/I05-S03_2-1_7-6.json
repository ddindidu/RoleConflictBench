She was on the verge of a major promotion, and I knew how much this meant to her. As her mentor, I felt responsible for helping her prepare, offering encouragement, and making myself available for last-minute questions. She\u2019d asked if we could meet this Saturday for a mock interview\u2014her only free day before the big event.\n\nBut as a citizen, I\u2019d already committed to volunteering at the vaccine clinic this weekend. The community center was short-staffed, and the clinic was crucial for our neighborhood\u2019s health. I\u2019d also planned to finalize my tax documents, a task I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t leave until the last minute this year.\n\nThe weight of both roles pressed on me. My mentee was counting on me to help her grow, but my community needed me, too. I stared at my calendar, heart pounding, torn between the expectations of being a supportive mentor and a responsible citizen, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left undone."}
