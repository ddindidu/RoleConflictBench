As I handed a pen to Mrs. Lee, she leaned in and quietly shared a personal concern about her recent struggles, trusting me to keep it private. I nodded, assuring her with my eyes that her words were safe with me. Later, during a break, I joined a group of acquaintances in the lounge. The conversation quickly turned to the recent decisions of a mutual colleague, and someone mentioned hearing rumors about Mrs. Lee\u2019s situation. The group looked at me, expecting me to confirm or deny what they\u2019d heard. As an acquaintance, I felt the pressure to participate, to not seem aloof or judgmental by refusing to engage. But as a volunteer, I knew I was expected to respect Mrs. Lee\u2019s privacy above all else. My heart pounded as I stood there, caught between the urge to fit in and the responsibility to protect someone\u2019s trust."}
