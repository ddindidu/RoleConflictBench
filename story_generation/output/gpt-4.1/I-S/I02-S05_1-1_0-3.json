Can we talk?\u201d My mind is still half in the courtroom, replaying the hearing I just finished. It was a minor case, nothing that would make headlines, but my client\u2019s anxious face lingers in my memory. I know I should check in with them, reassure them that things went as expected, and answer the follow-up questions I know are coming. That\u2019s what a good advocate does\u2014always available, always thorough.\n\nBut Mia\u2019s message tugs at me. She rarely asks for support outright, and I can picture her curled up on the couch, waiting for me to listen, to be present, to care. I want to be the boyfriend she needs, the one who drops everything to hold her hand and let her vent about her day. Yet, my client\u2019s email notification pings, and I feel the weight of my professional promise. I stand on the sidewalk, phone in hand, heart pulled in two directions, unsure which role to answer first."}
