The group chat with my project teammates was still buzzing, the arguments growing more heated by the minute. I knew I was supposed to let my mentor know about these issues right away\u2014she\u2019d always said that open communication was key, especially if something threatened our timeline. But my volunteer shift at the community center started in fifteen minutes, and I was expected to be there on time. I\u2019d promised reliability, and I hated the idea of letting the coordinator down, even if others could cover for me at the start. My stomach twisted as I weighed my options. If I called my mentor now, I\u2019d be late for my shift. If I waited until after volunteering, the conflict with my teammates might spiral even further out of control. Both roles demanded something from me, and I felt pulled in two directions, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
