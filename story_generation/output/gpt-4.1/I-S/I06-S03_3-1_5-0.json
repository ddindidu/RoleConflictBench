The project deadline loomed, and our conflict was threatening everything. As a mentee, I knew I should reach out to my mentor, let her know about the trouble before it got worse. But I hesitated, worried about seeming incapable or stirring up more tension. My phone buzzed with another angry message from the group chat, and I clenched the empty coffee cup in my hand, barely noticing the no-littering sign by the path. The trash bin was just a few steps away, but my thoughts were spinning\u2014should I risk my mentor\u2019s disappointment or try to fix things myself? I felt the weight of my responsibility as a citizen, to keep the park clean, to respect the rules. But the urge to just drop the cup and hurry home, to escape the stress, was strong. I stood there, torn between doing what was right for my mentor, my team, and my community, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me."}
