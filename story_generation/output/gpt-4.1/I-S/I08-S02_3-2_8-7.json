In five minutes, I\u2019d be live on air, expected to speak passionately and honestly about our cause\u2014about the need for transparency and accountability in our community. But just an hour ago, as an acquaintance, I\u2019d overheard something about a local leader\u2014something deeply personal, something that, if shared, could shatter their reputation. I knew the expectation: as an acquaintance, I should never gossip or use what I know to harm someone. But as an activist, I was supposed to educate the public, to shine a light on the truth, even if it was uncomfortable. My mind raced with the weight of both roles. Was I protecting someone\u2019s dignity, or was I hiding information the public deserved to know? The producer called my name. My heart pounded as I stood, torn between loyalty and responsibility, not knowing which part of myself would speak when the microphone turned on."}
