I\u2019ll miss you so much.\u201d It was our last weekend together before she moved abroad, and I knew how much it meant to her. She wanted every moment to count, and honestly, so did I. But then my volunteer coordinator\u2019s reminder popped up: \u201cDon\u2019t forget your shift starts at 9 a.m. sharp on Saturday!\u201d I\u2019d promised to help at the shelter, and I knew they counted on me to be reliable. Still, I also knew a couple of others could cover the early hours if I was late. My heart twisted as I imagined Mia\u2019s disappointed face if I cut our time short, but I also pictured the coordinator\u2019s frown if I didn\u2019t show up on time. Both sides expected something from me, and I felt pulled in two directions, guilt and anxiety swirling inside me as I tried to figure out what to do."}
