I wanted to be the mentor who not only shared knowledge but also modeled responsibility and integrity. That morning, as I walked to the community center, I found myself swept up in a street demonstration. The crowd\u2019s energy was electric, and I recognized some of my mentees among them, their eyes bright with conviction. Suddenly, someone urged us to step past a barricade onto restricted city property, insisting it was the only way to make our voices heard. As a citizen, I knew the law was clear\u2014crossing that line was illegal and disrespectful to public order. But as a mentor, I felt the weight of their expectations: to stand with them, to show courage, to lead by example. My heart pounded as I stood at the edge, torn between the urge to support my mentees and the responsibility to uphold the law. The conflicting demands pressed in on me, and I could feel their eyes searching my face for guidance."}
