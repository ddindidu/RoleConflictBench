She smiled, and I returned the gesture, exchanging a quick hello. She\u2019s always been kind, and I try to be a good neighbor\u2014friendly, polite, never causing trouble. Later that evening, my friends and I planned to play music in my apartment. It was already late, but we were excited. As I set up the speakers, I remembered the building\u2019s quiet hours had started, and I noticed Mrs. Lee\u2019s windows were open just across the courtyard. As a citizen, I know I should respect the rules and everyone\u2019s right to peace and quiet. But as a neighbor, I don\u2019t want to seem unfriendly or inconsiderate, especially after our pleasant exchange earlier. The thought of disturbing her, or anyone else, made my stomach twist. I stood there, torn between wanting to enjoy my evening and the responsibility I felt to respect both the law and my neighbor\u2019s comfort."}
