But across from me sat Maya, a new volunteer, nervously flipping through her own pile. She\u2019d asked for help understanding the sorting system, and as her mentor, I was expected to guide her, to share my experience so she wouldn\u2019t make a mistake\u2014especially since a single error could mean a patient\u2019s private information ended up in the wrong hands.\n\nMaya looked up, uncertainty in her eyes. \u201cCan you show me an example?\u201d she whispered. I hesitated, my hand hovering over a file. If I showed her a real record, I\u2019d be breaking the promise of confidentiality. But if I didn\u2019t, she might misfile something critical. The weight of both roles pressed on me\u2014mentor and volunteer\u2014each demanding something the other forbade. My heart pounded as I tried to find a way to honor both, feeling the tension coil tighter with every second of silence."}
