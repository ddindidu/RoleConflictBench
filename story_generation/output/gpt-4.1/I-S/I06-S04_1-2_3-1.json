It\u2019s already 5:30 p.m., and the polling station closes at seven. I still have groceries in the trunk and a list of chores at home. As I unload the bags, my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder to email my mentor if I have any questions. I do have a question, a small one about a term in the project brief. It\u2019s not urgent, but my mentor always says, \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to reach out, even for little things.\u201d I know she expects me to communicate openly, to show I\u2019m engaged and proactive.\n\nBut if I sit down to draft a thoughtful message now, I might lose my window to vote. The polling station is across town, and traffic is unpredictable at this hour. I feel torn\u2014should I prioritize my responsibility as a mentee, keeping the lines of communication open, or rush out to fulfill my civic duty as a voter? Both roles matter to me, and both come with expectations I don\u2019t want to let down. My mind races, weighing the disappointment of my mentor against the importance of casting my ballot. I stand in the kitchen, paralyzed, keys in one hand and phone in the other, caught between two worlds."}
