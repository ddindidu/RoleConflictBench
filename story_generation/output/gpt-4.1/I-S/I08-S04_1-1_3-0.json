It was Mark, an old acquaintance from college, asking if I could recommend a good restaurant nearby. He was in town for a few hours and sounded a bit lost, hoping I could help him out. As an acquaintance, I felt I should take a few minutes to chat, maybe even meet up if he wanted company. That\u2019s what a decent person would do, right? But then I glanced at the clock. The polling station was open all day, and my schedule was light, but I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d vote early, just in case something came up later. I could feel the tug between wanting to be helpful and not wanting to put off my civic duty. If I got caught up with Mark, would I lose my momentum and forget to vote? Or would I seem rude if I brushed him off too quickly? The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, and I hesitated, phone in hand, torn between being a good acquaintance and a responsible voter."}
