The team meeting was about to start, and I knew how important it was\u2014today\u2019s agenda included critical project updates that wouldn\u2019t be recapped later. As a colleague, I was expected to be present, to contribute, and to show my commitment to the team. But my phone buzzed with a reminder: the court session for my client was scheduled in just thirty minutes, across town. As their advocate, punctuality wasn\u2019t just a courtesy\u2014it was essential. My client\u2019s case depended on my presence and preparation. I could feel the weight of both roles pressing down on me, each demanding my full attention at the same time. My mind raced with possible solutions, but none seemed fair to either side. I stared at my calendar, torn between loyalty to my team and responsibility to my client, wishing I could split myself in two."}
