Why didn\u2019t you tell me about your plans?\u201d My fingers hovered over the screen, wanting to call and explain, to smooth over the misunderstanding before it grew into something bigger. As his girlfriend, I knew how much he valued clear communication and resolving things quickly. But the clock on my desk glared at me\u20148:42. I had to be in court by 9:00, and this session was crucial for my client\u2019s case. As their advocate, punctuality wasn\u2019t just expected; it was non-negotiable. My mind raced, torn between the urge to call Alex and the professional duty pulling me out the door. If I left now, I\u2019d be on time, but the thought of Alex stewing in confusion and hurt gnawed at me. If I called, I\u2019d risk being late, letting down my client and possibly jeopardizing their case. My phone buzzed again, and I felt the weight of both worlds pressing in, demanding I choose which role to honor first."}
