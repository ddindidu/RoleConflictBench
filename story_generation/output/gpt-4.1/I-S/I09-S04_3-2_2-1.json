A few neighbors had gathered, their faces tense. The noise complaint\u2014about loud music late at night\u2014was the talk of the floor, and everyone expected me to join the conversation, to be friendly and polite, maybe even help smooth things over. I could see the hope in their eyes, the silent plea for neighborly support.\n\nBut as I glanced at the clock above the mailboxes, my heart thudded. The polling station would close in less than two hours, and I still had to drop off the groceries and pick up my ID. Voting was important to me; I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss it. Yet here I was, torn between the expectation to be a good neighbor\u2014present, courteous, helpful\u2014and my duty as a voter, to show up before the polls closed. My mind raced, guilt and anxiety tangling together, as I stood rooted in the lobby, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in from either side."}
