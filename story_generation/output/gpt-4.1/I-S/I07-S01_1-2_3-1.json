My spreadsheet for the quarterly report was nearly done, and technically, I still had a few days before the deadline. My manager had said it was fine to finish by the end of the week, and my colleagues could keep working on their parts without mine for now. Still, I knew that if I left now, I\u2019d be leaving a task unfinished, and I hated the idea of not pulling my weight.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the shelter started in thirty minutes. The coordinator had sent a message this morning, stressing how important it was for everyone to be on time today. The roster was tight, and every role needed to be filled the moment the doors opened. I could picture the faces of the people waiting outside, counting on us.\n\nI sat frozen at my desk, torn between the quiet pressure of my workplace and the urgent need at the shelter. My mind raced, weighing the expectations of my colleagues against the commitment I\u2019d made as a volunteer, feeling the knot of guilt and responsibility tighten in my chest."}
