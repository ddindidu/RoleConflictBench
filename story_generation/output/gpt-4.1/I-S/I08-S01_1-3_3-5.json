It was Mark, someone I knew from my running group. \u201cHey, you know the area well\u2014can you recommend a good restaurant for my friend? She has some dietary restrictions, so something accommodating would be great.\u201d I glanced at the files in front of me. I\u2019d just read about a new place that catered to specific allergies, but I only knew about it because I\u2019d seen it listed in a client\u2019s medical history. As an acquaintance, I wanted to help Mark and be friendly, but as a volunteer, I was bound to keep everything I learned here private. My mind raced, torn between wanting to be helpful and the heavy responsibility of confidentiality. I could feel the tension building inside me, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, unsure of what to say next."}
