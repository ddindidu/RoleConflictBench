As an acquaintance, I know I should go over, smile, and help her feel at ease. I remember how overwhelming these gatherings can be, and I want to be the friendly face she needs. But my phone buzzes\u2014a reminder that I\u2019m due on air in five minutes to talk about climate justice, a cause I\u2019ve poured my heart into. As an activist, I feel the weight of responsibility: this radio segment is a rare chance to reach hundreds, maybe thousands, and I need to be focused, articulate, and ready. My mind races. If I leave her now, she might feel even more isolated. If I stay, I risk being late and unprepared for the interview. I can feel the tension knotting in my stomach, torn between being the supportive acquaintance and the committed activist, both roles demanding my presence at the same moment."}
