The stakes weren\u2019t high, but as their advocate, I knew I had to be sharp, assertive, and unwavering. Just then, I noticed a familiar face\u2014someone I\u2019d met at a friend\u2019s party last month. She was here too, looking lost and anxious, clutching a folder to her chest. As an acquaintance, I felt the urge to approach her, offer a warm smile, and help her feel at ease. I remembered how shy she\u2019d been before, and I didn\u2019t want her to feel alone in this intimidating place.\n\nBut as an advocate, I needed to focus on my client, review my notes, and maintain a professional distance. If I got too friendly or distracted, I might miss something important. Yet, ignoring her felt cold and unfriendly, especially when she glanced at me with hopeful eyes. My mind raced, torn between the expectation to be approachable and the duty to be fully present for my client. The tension twisted in my chest as I weighed my next move, feeling the pressure of both roles pulling me in opposite directions."}
