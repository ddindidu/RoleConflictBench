My phone buzzed with a reminder from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, everyone must double-check the new safety steps before tomorrow\u2019s event.\u201d I knew how important it was to follow the updated guidelines\u2014last week\u2019s incident had everyone on edge, and the coordinator made it clear there was no room for error.\n\nAs I set my bag down, I noticed my girlfriend sitting quietly on the couch, her shoulders tense. She offered a small smile, but I could tell something was off. I remembered how she\u2019d mentioned a tough meeting at work earlier. I wanted to sit beside her, listen, and help her decompress. She always said my support made a difference on days like this.\n\nBut the coordinator\u2019s message echoed in my mind. I still had to review the new safety checklist and send in my confirmation tonight. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be letting the team down. My heart tugged in two directions\u2014toward her, needing comfort, and toward my responsibility as a volunteer. I stood there, torn, unsure which role to answer first."}
