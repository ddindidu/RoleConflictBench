First, a message from Mark, an old college acquaintance: \u201cHey! You know any good restaurants around here? Need to impress someone tonight.\u201d I smiled, remembering our late-night study sessions, and felt the familiar pull to help, to be friendly and supportive. Before I could reply, my work phone rang. It was Mrs. Patel, my client, her voice tight with anxiety. \u201cI just got a notice from the landlord. What should I do? I need to act now, or I might lose my apartment.\u201d As her advocate, I knew she depended on me for clear, immediate legal advice\u2014no room for error or delay.\n\nI stared at my screens, feeling the weight of both expectations. Mark would expect a quick, thoughtful reply, maybe even a follow-up call. Mrs. Patel needed my undivided attention and expertise, right now. My mind raced, torn between the easy camaraderie of friendship and the heavy responsibility of advocacy. I could feel the tension building in my chest, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, uncertain which message to answer first."}
