The deadline was in three days, and I knew she expected me to show up prepared, ready to discuss my approach and the challenges I faced. I wanted to impress her, to prove I was serious about learning. But my mind kept drifting back to the community center, where I volunteered every Thursday evening. Just a few hours ago, a client had leaned in close at the check-in table, voice barely above a whisper, and shared a private concern about their living situation. They trusted me to keep it confidential, to respect their privacy. Now, as I tried to focus on my assignment, the weight of that trust pressed on me. Should I tell someone at the center who might be able to help, even if it meant breaking confidentiality? Or should I keep the secret, knowing it might mean missing a chance to get them support? The expectations from both roles pulled at me, and I felt caught in the middle, unsure which responsibility should come first."}
