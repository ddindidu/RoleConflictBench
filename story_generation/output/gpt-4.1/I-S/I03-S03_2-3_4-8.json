After weeks of mismatched schedules, my boyfriend and I finally had one open evening before I left for a work trip. He\u2019d planned dinner, even picked up my favorite dessert. I could see the hope in his eyes\u2014he wanted us to forget the world and just be together. But as I set the table, the city\u2019s emergency alert blared from my phone: flash-flood warning, evacuate ground floors, check on neighbors. The building alarms wailed, and I could already hear water rushing in the street. My mind raced\u2014should I help Mrs. Lee upstairs, who lives alone and can\u2019t move quickly? Should I knock on doors, make sure everyone\u2019s safe? But then I saw my boyfriend, his hand reaching for mine, silently pleading for this one night we\u2019d carved out. My heart twisted, torn between the warmth of his presence and the urgent pull of responsibility outside our door. I stood frozen, the weight of both worlds pressing in, knowing I couldn\u2019t give myself fully to either without letting the other down."}
