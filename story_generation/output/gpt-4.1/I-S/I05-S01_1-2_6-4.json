She\u2019d missed two deadlines this week, and I could see the stress weighing on her. As her mentor, I wanted to help her grow, to guide her toward better time management, but I also knew she was proud and private. Later that afternoon, while volunteering at the community center, a client leaned in as I handed her a pen. In a hushed voice, she confided a personal struggle that explained her recent absences. She asked me not to tell anyone. My mind raced\u2014her story could help my mentee understand she wasn\u2019t alone, that others faced similar challenges. But as a volunteer, I was bound to protect the client\u2019s privacy. The urge to support my mentee tugged at me, but so did the promise of confidentiality. I felt torn, caught between the responsibility to encourage growth and the duty to respect trust. My hands trembled slightly as I realized I couldn\u2019t fulfill both roles without betraying one."}
