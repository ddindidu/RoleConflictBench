My mentee had just called, voice trembling, desperate for last-minute advice before presenting the project that could launch their career. As their mentor, I\u2019d promised to be there, to guide them through moments like this, to never let them feel alone at the edge of something so important. But here I was, standing in a crowded polling station, clutching a provisional ballot form. The election official\u2019s instructions echoed in my mind: \u201cYou must complete this before we close in ten minutes, or you can\u2019t vote.\u201d I could hear the expectation in their tone\u2014follow the rules, don\u2019t hold up the process. My mentee\u2019s name flashed on my screen again. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. I wanted to be the mentor who never let them down, but I also knew the importance of my vote, the civic duty I\u2019d waited all year to fulfill. My hands shook as I stared at the form, caught between two worlds, each demanding all of me at the same time."}
