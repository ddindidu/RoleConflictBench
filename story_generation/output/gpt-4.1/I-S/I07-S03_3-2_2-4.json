In ten minutes, our team\u2019s final meeting before the project launch would begin. My manager had emphasized how crucial everyone\u2019s input was\u2014this was the last chance to raise concerns or suggest changes. As a colleague, I knew my absence would be noticed, maybe even resented. But at the same time, my phone buzzed with a notification: the live online forum for our district\u2019s candidates was starting. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to listen, to ask questions, to help shape the future of my community. I\u2019d always believed in being an active participant, not just a bystander.
