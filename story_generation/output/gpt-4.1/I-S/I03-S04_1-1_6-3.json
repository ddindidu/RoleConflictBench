As his girlfriend, I knew he expected me to clear things up quickly, to talk it out and not let small misunderstandings fester. But my mind was already tangled with another worry: today was voting day, and I\u2019d just realized my driver\u2019s license was missing from my wallet. I could use my passport or student card, but both were at home, a half-hour away. I could go back later, but the polling station closed early, and lines were unpredictable.\n\nAlex\u2019s message blinked on my screen, waiting for a reply. I felt the weight of his expectation\u2014don\u2019t let this turn into a fight. At the same time, the civic duty pressed on me: don\u2019t mess up your chance to vote. My chest tightened as I tried to decide which role to prioritize, feeling pulled in two directions, knowing I couldn\u2019t give either the attention it deserved."}
