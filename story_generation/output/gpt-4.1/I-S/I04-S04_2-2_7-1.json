She thought I was annoyed with her, but it was just a rushed text\u2014nothing more. I knew I should call her right away, clear things up before the misunderstanding grew. That\u2019s what friends do: talk things out, make sure nothing festers. But as I glanced at the clock, panic crept in. The polling station would close in less than two hours, and I still had to get there. Voting mattered to me; it was my responsibility, my voice. I couldn\u2019t let the day slip by without casting my ballot. Yet, Jamie\u2019s hurt echoed in my mind, and I imagined her waiting for my call, needing reassurance. I felt pulled in two directions\u2014one by loyalty to my friend, the other by my duty as a citizen. My hands trembled as I held my phone, torn between dialing her number and grabbing my keys to rush out the door."}
