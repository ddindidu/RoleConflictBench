As I stepped into the hallway, cake in hand, the building\u2019s alarm blared, echoing off the walls. My phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning\u2014water was already pooling at the curb outside. I could hear anxious voices from behind doors, and someone shouted for help from the stairwell. \n\nAs a neighbor, I wanted to knock on doors, introduce myself, and offer the cake, maybe even comfort those who seemed scared. But as a citizen, I felt the weight of responsibility: I should help coordinate an evacuation, check on the elderly couple on the third floor, and make sure everyone followed the emergency procedures. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the warmth of a friendly gesture and the urgent call to action for the safety of everyone in the building."}
