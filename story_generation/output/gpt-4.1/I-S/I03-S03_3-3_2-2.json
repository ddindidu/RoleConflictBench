His eyes were red and swollen, his grief raw and heavy after losing his brother just days ago. I knew he needed me\u2014needed my comfort, my presence, my unwavering support. The demonstration was loud, chaotic, and Alex wanted to be here, to shout, to feel something other than pain. Suddenly, a surge of people pressed forward, and someone shouted for us to cross the barricade, to make our voices heard. Alex looked at me, desperate, pleading, as if this act might help him find some release. But the barricade was clear: city property, off-limits, police watching. As a citizen, I knew the rules, the importance of respecting boundaries and public order. But as a girlfriend, I saw Alex\u2019s need, his silent request for me to stand with him, to break the rules for his sake. My heart pounded, torn between the law and the person I loved, between what was right for the city and what was right for him. I squeezed his hand, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which part of me should lead."}
