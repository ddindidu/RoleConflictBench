The HOA inspection is tomorrow, and I know anything blocking the exit could get us all cited. As a neighbor, I want to be considerate, maybe gently remind her to move her things, but I also know she\u2019s overwhelmed with her newborn. I hesitate, not wanting to add to her stress.\n\nJust as I\u2019m about to knock on her door, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a client, frantic about a legal deadline. She needs clear, immediate advice\u2014her case could fall apart if I\u2019m not precise. My mind races, torn between the urgency of my client\u2019s needs and the responsibility I feel toward my neighbor and our building\u2019s safety. I can\u2019t ignore either, but I can\u2019t be in two places at once. My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, phone in hand, caught between the demands of being a good neighbor and a reliable advocate."}
