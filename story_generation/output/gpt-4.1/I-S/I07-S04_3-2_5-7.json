I\u2019d promised my team I\u2019d have it done, and I knew the client was waiting. But I was standing in the middle of the polling station, ballot envelope in hand, when the poll worker frowned and slid it back to me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the signature smudged. Please re-sign so your vote counts.\u201d I glanced at the clock\u2014if I left now, I could make it back to my desk and finish the task before the deadline. But the poll worker\u2019s eyes were kind but firm, and the instructions were clear: follow the process, make sure your vote is valid.
