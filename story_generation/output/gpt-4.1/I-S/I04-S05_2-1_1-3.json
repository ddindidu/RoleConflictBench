It was Jamie, my closest friend, and her voice trembled as she asked if I had a moment. She\u2019d just had a blowout with her partner, and I could hear the tears she was trying to hold back. As her friend, I knew what she needed\u2014someone to listen, to reassure her, to let her vent without judgment. I wanted to be there for her, to give her the comfort she deserved.\n\nBut glancing at the clock, I felt my stomach twist. In twenty minutes, I had to be in court, representing a client at a minor hearing. The stakes weren\u2019t high, but my role as their advocate demanded my full attention and preparation. They were counting on me to be present, focused, and professional, no matter how routine the case seemed.\n\nI could feel the weight of both expectations pressing down on me\u2014Jamie\u2019s need for a friend, my client\u2019s need for an advocate. My mind raced, torn between answering Jamie\u2019s pain and fulfilling my professional duty, knowing I couldn\u2019t give my best to both at the same time."}
