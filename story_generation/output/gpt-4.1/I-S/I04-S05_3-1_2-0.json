On the other end, my friend\u2019s voice trembled with tears\u2014her father had just been rushed to the hospital. She needed me to listen, to be there, to help her make sense of the chaos. I sat up, heart pounding, trying to offer comfort, but as she poured out her fears, she started asking about the legal implications of her father\u2019s will and medical decisions. As her friend, I wanted to soothe her, to just listen and hold space for her pain. But as an advocate, I knew I couldn\u2019t give her the detailed legal advice she was seeking in this emotional moment, especially without all the facts. My mind raced, torn between the urge to reassure her with answers and the professional responsibility to avoid giving incomplete or misleading information. I could feel her desperation through the phone, and my own anxiety grew as I wrestled with the expectations of being both her confidant and her legal guide."}
