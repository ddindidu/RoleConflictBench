She\u2019s managed to carve out a precious half hour for me, squeezed between her meetings. I know how busy she is, and I promised myself I\u2019d never waste her time. I owe her so much\u2014her guidance, her patience, her belief in me. But as I gather my notes, another message pops up: a fellow activist is live-streaming from the city square. The turnout is small, the energy low, and they\u2019re asking for backup. I can see the worry in their eyes, hear the urgency in their voice. I\u2019ve always told my group I\u2019d be there when it mattered, that I\u2019d help amplify our cause. My heart pounds as I stare at the clock, feeling the weight of both promises. I want to be the reliable mentee, the committed activist. But right now, I can\u2019t be both. My hands tremble as I try to decide which part of myself I\u2019ll have to let down."}
