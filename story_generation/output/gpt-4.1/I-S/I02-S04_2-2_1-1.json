Only two hours left before the polls closed, and I still hadn\u2019t voted. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss this election, not after everything that\u2019s happened this year. But as I grabbed my keys, I heard the front door open. My partner walked in, eyes red and shoulders slumped. She barely managed a weak smile before collapsing onto the couch. \u201cIt was awful,\u201d she whispered, voice trembling. \u201cMy boss said my project wasn\u2019t good enough. I feel like I\u2019m failing.\u201d\n\nI sat beside her, torn. She needed me\u2014needed someone to listen, to hold her, to remind her she\u2019s more than her job. But the minutes ticked by, and the weight of my civic duty pressed on me. If I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning her when she was most vulnerable. If I stayed, I might lose my chance to vote, something I\u2019d always believed was my responsibility. My mind spun with guilt and anxiety, caught between being the boyfriend she deserved and the citizen I wanted to be."}
