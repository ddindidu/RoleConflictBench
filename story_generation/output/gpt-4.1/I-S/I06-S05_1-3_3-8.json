In ten minutes, I need to be at the courthouse, briefcase in hand, ready to advocate for my client in a case that could change their life. My phone buzzes\u2014a reminder to check in with my mentor, as I promised to communicate any challenges promptly. I have a small question about a legal term in the brief I\u2019m preparing for her, nothing urgent, but she\u2019s always emphasized transparency and immediate communication. I know she expects me to reach out, even for minor uncertainties, to build trust and show diligence. But if I call her now, I risk being late to the hearing, and punctuality is non-negotiable in advocacy. My client\u2019s fate could hinge on my presence. I stare at my phone, torn between the responsibility to my mentor and my duty to my client. The weight of both roles presses on me, each expectation pulling me in a different direction, and I can feel the anxiety rising as I try to decide which obligation to honor first."}
