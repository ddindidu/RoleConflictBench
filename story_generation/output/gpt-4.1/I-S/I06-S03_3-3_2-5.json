The assignment was detailed and urgent\u2014she\u2019d made it clear that my work would be reviewed by upper management tomorrow. I could almost hear her voice: \u201cThis is your chance to show what you\u2019ve learned. Don\u2019t let me down.\u201d My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but my mind kept drifting to the flyer on my fridge. The polling place was just a few blocks away, and the ballot measure would directly impact our neighborhood\u2019s safety. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d always vote, always be an active citizen. But the polls closed in two hours, and the assignment would take at least that long if I wanted it to be good. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations\u2014my mentor counting on me, my community needing my voice. I felt torn, the pressure mounting from both sides, knowing that whatever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
