My mentor had suggested I read this article to deepen my understanding, and even though the deadline was weeks away, I knew she\u2019d be pleased if I finished it early. I wanted to show her I was committed, that I valued her guidance. But my activist group\u2019s latest post was exploding online\u2014hundreds of people were commenting, asking questions, and sharing their own stories. If I jumped in now, I could clarify misconceptions and provide resources, maybe even turn this moment into real momentum for our cause. My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind about the importance of thorough preparation, but the activist in me felt the urgency of the moment slipping away. I stared at the screen, torn between the quiet responsibility of being a good mentee and the electric pull of making a difference right now. My heart raced as I weighed which expectation mattered more in this moment, feeling the pressure of both roles pressing in on me."}
