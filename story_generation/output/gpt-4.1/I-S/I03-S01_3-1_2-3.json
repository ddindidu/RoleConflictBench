He hadn\u2019t said much since the call about his uncle. My heart ached to comfort him, to be the girlfriend he needed\u2014someone who could listen, hold him, and maybe even share a story to ease his pain. But as he stared at the floor, he asked, \u201cHow do you deal with loss? You must see it a lot at the shelter.\u201d\n\nMy mind flashed to the woman I\u2019d spoken with that morning, her own grief raw and recent. I wanted to draw on that experience, to show Alex he wasn\u2019t alone, but I knew the rules: never share details, never betray trust. Still, Alex\u2019s expectation was clear\u2014he wanted me to open up, to connect. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in, my desire to help him clashing with my promise to protect the privacy of those I serve. My words caught in my throat, torn between being the supportive girlfriend and the responsible volunteer."}
