My mentee, Sarah, had just admitted during our check-in that she was overwhelmed, her deadlines slipping through her fingers. As her mentor, I knew I should stay, help her map out a plan, and encourage her to prioritize her tasks. She needed guidance, and I could see the hope in her eyes, waiting for me to offer support.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: the polling place down the street would close in two hours. There was a ballot measure up for vote that would directly impact my neighborhood\u2014something I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d weigh in on, as any responsible citizen should. I\u2019d spent weeks reading up, talking to neighbors, and now, if I didn\u2019t go soon, I\u2019d lose my chance to participate.\n\nI felt torn, my sense of duty pulling me in two directions. Sarah\u2019s growth depended on my presence, but my community needed my voice. My heart pounded as I tried to decide which responsibility I owed more in this moment."}
