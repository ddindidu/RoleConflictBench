I could tell something was off with Mia\u2014her smile was thinner, her laugh a little forced. I wanted to be the boyfriend she needed, the one who noticed and asked, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d But as we passed a bench, she unwrapped a granola bar and, almost absentmindedly, crumpled the wrapper and dropped it on the grass. My heart skipped. The trash bin was just a few steps away, and the no-littering signs were clear. As a citizen, I felt a jolt of responsibility, a duty to respect the park and the people who shared it. But Mia\u2019s eyes flickered to mine, searching for comfort, not criticism. I could feel the tension coil inside me\u2014should I gently remind her about the trash, risking her feeling judged when she already seemed fragile, or should I let it go, betraying my own values and the rules I believed in? The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I hesitated, caught between the person I wanted to be for her and the citizen I tried to be for everyone."}
