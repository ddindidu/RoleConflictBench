My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, is traveling and asked if I could keep an eye out for her package deliveries, especially since there\u2019s a planned power interruption in our building. She trusts me, and I know how much she worries about her medication shipments. As her neighbor, I want to help\u2014after all, we look out for each other here.\n\nBut as a citizen, I also feel the weight of other responsibilities. I\u2019ve been carefully organizing my tax documents, determined to file early this year. Plus, the city is hosting a free vaccine clinic at the community center this weekend, and I know how important it is to show up and support public health efforts, especially after everything we\u2019ve been through.\n\nThe problem is, the power outage and Mrs. Lee\u2019s deliveries are likely to happen right when the clinic is open. I can\u2019t be in two places at once. I feel torn\u2014should I prioritize my neighbor\u2019s trust and her urgent needs, or fulfill my civic duty and contribute to the greater good? The pressure is mounting, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, no matter what I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
