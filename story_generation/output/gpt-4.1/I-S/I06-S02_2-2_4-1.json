My mentor always says, \u201cIf you hit a wall, let me know right away.\u201d But my phone buzzes with messages from the activist group\u2014today\u2019s protest is about to start, and I\u2019m supposed to lead the first chant. I can already hear the crowd gathering outside, their voices rising in anticipation. My mentor expects me to be responsible, to communicate any setbacks immediately so we can keep the project on track. But the movement expects me to be present, to inspire others and show unwavering commitment. My heart pounds as I weigh the responsibility to my mentor against the urgency of the cause. I feel pulled in two directions, guilt and anxiety twisting inside me. If I email my mentor now, I\u2019ll miss the march. If I go to the protest, I\u2019ll be letting my mentor down. The minutes tick by, and I\u2019m frozen, torn between the two worlds that both mean so much to me."}
