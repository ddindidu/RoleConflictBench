Our argument last night had spiraled out of control, and now he was threatening to leave if we didn\u2019t talk things through today. I knew I should go to him, try to resolve things before they got worse. That\u2019s what a good girlfriend would do\u2014face the conflict, not run from it. But as I stood up, I glanced out the window and saw the sun blazing down. The news had warned everyone to check on vulnerable neighbors during the heatwave, and Mrs. Kim, who lived alone down the hall, came to mind. She was frail, and I hadn\u2019t seen her all morning. As a citizen, I felt responsible for her well-being, especially now. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands: Alex needed me to save our relationship, but Mrs. Kim might need me to stay safe. I felt torn, guilt pressing in from both sides, unsure which role I should answer first."}
