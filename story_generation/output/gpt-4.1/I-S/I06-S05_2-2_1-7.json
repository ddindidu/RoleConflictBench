She\u2019d been clear: \u201cHave it ready before our next meeting in three days.\u201d I wanted to impress her, to show I was serious about learning. But my phone buzzed with a calendar alert\u2014tomorrow\u2019s court session for my client, a case that could change their life. As their advocate, I had to be there, prepared and on time. Missing it wasn\u2019t an option; my client was counting on me. Yet, every hour spent prepping for court was an hour stolen from the code assignment. My mentor expected dedication, progress, and follow-through. My client expected unwavering support and punctuality. I felt the pressure mounting, my mind tugged in two directions, guilt gnawing at me no matter which task I focused on. I couldn\u2019t let either of them down, but the hours in the day were slipping away, and I was trapped between two promises I wasn\u2019t sure I could keep."}
