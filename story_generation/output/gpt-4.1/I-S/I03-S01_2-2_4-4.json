My boyfriend and I had circled tonight on our calendars weeks ago\u2014our only free night before I left for a week-long work trip. He\u2019d planned dinner, even picked out a movie he knew I\u2019d love. I could see how much he was looking forward to it, and honestly, so was I. But as I finished my volunteer shift at the shelter, a client lingered at the check-in table. Her voice was barely above a whisper as she confided in me, her words heavy with trust and vulnerability. She needed someone to listen, someone to keep her secret safe. I felt the pull of her need, the unspoken expectation that I would honor her privacy and be present for her. My phone buzzed again\u2014a message from my boyfriend, asking if I was on my way. My heart twisted, caught between the promise of a rare evening together and the responsibility I felt to this woman who had chosen me, in this moment, to hold her story."}
