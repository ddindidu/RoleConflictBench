I winced, knowing how much she valued her quiet afternoons. As a neighbor, I always tried to be considerate\u2014keeping Max leashed, cleaning up after him, and apologizing for any noise. But today, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I was scheduled to go live on the radio in five minutes to talk about environmental justice, a cause I\u2019d poured my heart into. The community expected me to be articulate, focused, and ready to educate listeners. But Max\u2019s barking was only getting louder, and I could already imagine the irritation building next door. My mind raced\u2014should I calm Max down and risk missing the start of the show, or ignore the noise and fulfill my activist duty, possibly at the expense of my neighborly responsibilities? My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the two worlds that meant so much to me."}
