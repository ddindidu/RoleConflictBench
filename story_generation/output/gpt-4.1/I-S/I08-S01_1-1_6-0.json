As an acquaintance, I always tried to avoid gossip or speaking negatively about others, but the group\u2019s laughter and pointed comments made it hard to stay silent or slip away unnoticed. My phone buzzed\u2014a reminder that my volunteer shift started in fifteen minutes. I knew several other volunteers were already there and could easily cover for me if I was a little late, but I also prided myself on being reliable and punctual. The group looked at me, waiting for my opinion on Mark. I felt the pressure to join in, to fit in with the group, but I also felt the tug of responsibility to leave now and arrive on time for my shift. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of being a good acquaintance and a dependable volunteer, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
