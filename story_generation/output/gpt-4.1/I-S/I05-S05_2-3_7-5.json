As a mentor, I was supposed to meet with Maya in an hour\u2014her big interview was tomorrow, and she was counting on me to help her prepare. She\u2019d worked so hard, and I wanted nothing more than to see her succeed, to give her the confidence and guidance she needed to take this next step in her career.
