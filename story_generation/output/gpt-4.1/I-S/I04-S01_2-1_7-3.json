I could tell right away from her reply that she\u2019d misunderstood my last text\u2014she sounded hurt, and I knew I needed to call her immediately to clear things up. That\u2019s what friends do: we talk things out, we don\u2019t let misunderstandings fester. But at that exact moment, I was sitting in the community center, volunteering at the weekly support group. The conversation with the group had drifted into personal territory, nothing too sensitive, but I was always careful to respect everyone\u2019s privacy. I couldn\u2019t just step out and take a call, not when I was supposed to be present and trustworthy. Yet, the longer I waited, the more I worried Jamie would think I was ignoring her or didn\u2019t care. My mind raced, torn between the urge to be a good friend and the responsibility to honor the trust of those I was helping. I stared at my phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
