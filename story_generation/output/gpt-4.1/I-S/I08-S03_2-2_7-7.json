She\u2019s really slipping.\u201d As an acquaintance, I\u2019ve always believed in not gossiping or speaking ill of others, so I felt uncomfortable, but I didn\u2019t want to seem unfriendly or judgmental. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a city alert: a heat advisory had been issued. I remembered Mrs. Patel, my elderly neighbor who lives alone on our floor. As a responsible citizen, I knew I should check on her, maybe bring her some water or help her set up a fan. But Mark was waiting for my response, expecting me to join in his criticism, and I felt torn. Should I excuse myself abruptly and risk offending him, or stay and risk neglecting my duty to help Mrs. Patel during the heatwave? The weight of these conflicting expectations pressed on me, and I stood there, caught between the demands of being a considerate acquaintance and a responsible citizen, unsure of which role to honor first."}
