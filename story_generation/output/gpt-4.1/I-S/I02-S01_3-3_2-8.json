She\u2019d just lost her uncle, and her voice trembled as she tried to make sense of it. I wanted nothing more than to be there, to hold her, to let her cry on my shoulder. She needed me\u2014she said so, and I could hear it in every word. But as I tried to comfort her, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cMandatory meeting in 30 minutes. New procedures must be followed or we risk shutting down the shelter.\u201d The urgency in the message was clear. I knew how much the shelter depended on us, and how strict the coordinator was about following protocol. My girlfriend\u2019s pain pulled at me, but so did my responsibility to the people who relied on our service. My heart pounded as I stared at the two screens, feeling torn in half, unsure which part of me I could let down."}
