As a neighbor, I knew how important it was to be friendly, to show I cared about the peace in our building. I nodded, listening carefully, even as my phone buzzed insistently in my pocket. Glancing down, I saw the name of the legislative aide I\u2019d been trying to reach for weeks. This was my chance\u2014ten minutes to make a case for the bill I\u2019d poured my heart into as an activist. But Mrs. Lee\u2019s eyes were on me, expecting warmth and attention, while my activist side screamed at me to answer the call. My heart pounded as I weighed the demands: the neighbor who needed reassurance, the activist who needed to act. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between the urge to excuse myself and the duty to stay present, caught in the impossible space between two worlds."}
