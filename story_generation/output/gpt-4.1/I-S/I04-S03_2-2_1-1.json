It was Jamie, my closest friend, and I could hear the strain in their voice before they even spoke. \u201cCan you talk? I really need someone right now,\u201d they said, their words trembling. I knew what was expected of me\u2014I\u2019ve always been the one Jamie turns to, the one who listens without judgment and helps them sort through the mess. But as I glanced at the clock, I realized it was already past the building\u2019s quiet hours. The windows across the courtyard were open, and I remembered the last time someone complained about noise. As a resident and citizen, I\u2019m supposed to respect those rules, to make sure everyone can enjoy their peace. But Jamie\u2019s voice was breaking, and I could feel the weight of their need for support. My heart twisted as I stood there, torn between being the friend Jamie needed and the responsible neighbor I was supposed to be."}
