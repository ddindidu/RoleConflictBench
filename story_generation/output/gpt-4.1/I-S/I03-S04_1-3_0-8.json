Can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d I know he\u2019s been under pressure at work, and I promised I\u2019d be home early to talk things through. But now, the election official is explaining that my registration doesn\u2019t match, and if I want my vote to count, I have to fill out a provisional ballot\u2014right now, before the station closes in ten minutes. My heart pounds. I want to be there for him, to listen and reassure him like I always do, but I also know how important it is to follow the voting process correctly. The official\u2019s eyes are on me, waiting for my answer, while my partner\u2019s need for comfort tugs at me from the other side of town. I feel torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing in, unsure which expectation I should meet first."}
