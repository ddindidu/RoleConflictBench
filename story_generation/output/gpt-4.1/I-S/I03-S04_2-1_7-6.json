Jake and I have been at each other\u2019s throats all week about money\u2014who pays for what, how much we save, how much we spend. He texted me just now: \u201cCan we talk? I don\u2019t want to fight anymore.\u201d I know he expects me to help fix things, to be the one who smooths things over. That\u2019s what I usually do.\n\nBut right now, I\u2019m a voter, not a girlfriend. The election official\u2019s voice cuts through my thoughts: \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line.\u201d My last name is Bennett. The new line is longer, slower, but the official is watching. I\u2019m supposed to follow the rules, do what\u2019s asked, be a good citizen. But my phone buzzes again\u2014Jake, asking if I\u2019m ignoring him. I feel pulled in two directions: stay and resolve things with Jake, or follow the official\u2019s instructions and do my civic duty. My heart pounds as I stare at the lines, torn between the expectations of the person I love and the responsibility I owe my community."}
