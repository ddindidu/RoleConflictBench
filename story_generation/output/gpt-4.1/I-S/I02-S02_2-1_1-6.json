She needed me\u2014needed my arms around her, my words to remind her she was more than a performance review. I reached for her hand, but my phone buzzed again. The notification flashed: our campaign post was exploding online. This was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for, the chance to reach thousands, maybe more, with a comment that could shift the conversation. My activist friends would expect me to seize it, to educate, to not let the momentum slip away. But Maya\u2019s shoulders shook, and she looked at me, searching for comfort. I felt split in two\u2014torn between the cause I\u2019d poured my heart into and the person I loved, who needed me right now. My thumb hovered over my phone, my other hand still holding hers, my mind racing with guilt and urgency."}
