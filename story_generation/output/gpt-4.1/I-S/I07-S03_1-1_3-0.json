My mind wandered to the project I\u2019d been assigned at the office\u2014nothing urgent, but I\u2019d promised my team I\u2019d finish my part by Monday. The deadline was generous, and honestly, the others could keep moving without my piece for a while. As I unwrapped a snack, I noticed the trash bin a few steps away and the clear \u201cNo Littering\u201d signs posted everywhere. I felt the familiar tug of responsibility as a citizen: respect the rules, keep the park clean, do my part for the community. But then my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about the unfinished task. If I hurried home, I could get a head start and maybe impress my boss. The thought of tossing the wrapper on the ground, just this once, flashed through my mind. No one was watching. The park was nearly empty. I hesitated, wrapper in hand, torn between the easy shortcut and the right thing to do, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in on me."}
