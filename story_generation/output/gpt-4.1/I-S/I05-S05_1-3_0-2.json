As a mentor, I enjoyed these moments\u2014offering casual advice about networking or choosing projects, nothing too heavy. Today, though, Jamie\u2019s face was drawn with worry. \u201cI need your help,\u201d he said, voice low. \u201cA client\u2019s in trouble\u2014there\u2019s a contract dispute, and they need to act now. What should I tell them?\u201d\n\nMy mentor instincts urged me to reassure him, to offer a few encouraging words and let him find his own way. But as an advocate, I knew the stakes were higher. The client needed precise, accurate legal advice\u2014no room for guesswork or vague suggestions. Jamie was looking to me for guidance, but the line between friendly mentor and responsible advocate blurred uncomfortably. If I gave him a casual answer, I risked the client\u2019s interests. If I took over, I might undermine Jamie\u2019s confidence. My mind raced, torn between the gentle support of a mentor and the strict duty of an advocate, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in as Jamie waited for my response."}
