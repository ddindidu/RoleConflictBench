My team expected me to join our weekly catch-up, to show I was present and engaged, even if it was just another routine check-in. I knew the meeting would be recorded, but I also knew how much my manager valued visible participation. At the same time, my activist group\u2019s chat exploded with messages: a major news network wanted me on air, right now, to counter a wave of misinformation about our cause. This was the moment we\u2019d been preparing for\u2014an opportunity to reach thousands, maybe millions, and set the record straight. My heart pounded as I weighed the expectations: loyalty to my colleagues, who counted on me to be a team player, versus my responsibility to the movement, which needed my voice in this critical moment. I felt the pressure mounting, torn between two worlds, each demanding my presence, each unwilling to wait."}
