I glanced at my screen\u2014another message from a colleague, marked \u201cinformational, no immediate action required.\u201d Still, I knew our team valued quick responses, even for routine updates. I could already imagine the subtle disappointment if I didn\u2019t reply soon. But outside, the rain hammered the windows, and the street below was turning into a river. As a citizen, I felt a pull to help\u2014maybe check on neighbors, or at least make sure the lobby was clear for emergency crews.
