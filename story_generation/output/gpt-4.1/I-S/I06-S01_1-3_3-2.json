My mentor\u2019s message blinked on the screen: \u201cLet me know if you have any questions.\u201d I did have a question, a small one about terminology in the project brief. It wasn\u2019t urgent, but I remembered how she emphasized the importance of open communication. \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to reach out, even for minor things,\u201d she\u2019d said. I hesitated, fingers hovering over the keyboard. If I messaged her now, she might reply immediately, expecting a quick back-and-forth. But I was the only volunteer scheduled to unlock the community center, and people would already be waiting outside. If I left late, I\u2019d keep everyone waiting in the cold. If I didn\u2019t message my mentor, I\u2019d be ignoring her advice and maybe seem disengaged. My stomach twisted as I weighed the expectations\u2014responsible mentee, reliable volunteer\u2014each pulling me in a different direction, both demanding my presence at the same moment."}
