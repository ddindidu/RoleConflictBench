As a colleague, I was expected to finish the contract review by tomorrow\u2014my part was the last piece before we could deliver to the client, and everyone was counting on me. The project manager had already reminded me twice that any delay would push back the whole timeline. But as an advocate, I had a client whose hearing was scheduled for the same day. Their case was complicated, with high stakes and sensitive disputes. They needed me to be fully prepared, to pore over every detail and represent them with the care they deserved.\n\nI could feel the pressure mounting from both sides. My team relied on me to keep the project moving, but my client trusted me to fight for their interests. I wanted to be dependable in both roles, but the hours in the day were slipping away. My mind raced with possible solutions, but each seemed to let someone down. I sat at my desk, torn, the weight of conflicting expectations pressing in as I tried to decide what to do next."}
