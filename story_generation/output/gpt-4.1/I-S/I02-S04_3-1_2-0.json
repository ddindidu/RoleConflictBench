The polling station was just a few blocks away, and I had all day to get there. But right now, my girlfriend was curled up next to me, her eyes red and swollen from crying. She\u2019d just lost her father, and every few minutes, she\u2019d reach for my hand, needing me close. I knew she expected me to stay, to hold her, to listen as she tried to make sense of her grief. I wanted to be the boyfriend she needed, the one who wouldn\u2019t leave her side for even a moment.\n\nBut the thought of not voting gnawed at me. I\u2019d always believed in doing my civic duty, and I knew how important this election was. The hours ticked by, and I felt the weight of both roles pressing down on me. If I left, even for a short while, would she feel abandoned? If I stayed, would I regret missing my chance to have a say in our future? My heart ached as I tried to figure out how to be both the partner she needed and the citizen I wanted to be."}
