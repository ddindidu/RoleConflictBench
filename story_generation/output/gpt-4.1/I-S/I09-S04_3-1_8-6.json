My neighbor, Mrs. Kim, had texted again, reminding me to keep an eye out for her package while she was away. She was worried about the planned power outage, and I\u2019d promised to help. But now, I was at the polling station, my ballot in hand, when an official called out, \u201cLast names A\u2013M, please move to the new line!\u201d My last name started with K. The new line was longer and slower, but the official\u2019s tone left no room for argument. I glanced at the time, anxiety prickling. If I waited in the slower line, I might miss the delivery window for Mrs. Kim\u2019s package. If I left, I\u2019d be ignoring the official\u2019s instructions and possibly causing trouble at the polls. I felt torn, the weight of being a good neighbor and a responsible voter pressing on me from both sides, my mind racing as I tried to figure out what to do next."}
