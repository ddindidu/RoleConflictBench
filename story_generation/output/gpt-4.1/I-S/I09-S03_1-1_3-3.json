As a neighbor, I always tried to be considerate\u2014never overfilling the bin, never leaving it out too early, always making sure the lid was closed tight so nothing blew into Mrs. Lee\u2019s yard. But this week, the city newsletter had arrived, reminding me of my role as a citizen. There was a survey about the new bus routes, and the city wanted feedback. I knew the city was also encouraging residents to reduce waste and only put bins out when they were full, to cut down on unnecessary truck trips. \n\nI felt the pressure from both sides. If I waited until next week to put out the bin, I\u2019d be supporting the city\u2019s efforts to be more efficient and environmentally friendly. But what if my neighbor, who shares the bin, expected it to be out tomorrow? Would she think I was being inconsiderate, or worse, accuse me of hogging the space? I could already imagine the awkward conversation. My mind spun with the competing demands\u2014be a good neighbor, be a responsible citizen. I stood there, hands on the bin, torn between the two roles, unsure what to do next."}
