My teammate, Priya, is waiting for my numbers to finalize her report, and I know any delay from me will throw off her whole afternoon. The office hums with the usual urgency, and I feel the weight of being a reliable colleague pressing on my shoulders. Suddenly, my phone buzzes\u2014a call from the legislative aide I\u2019ve been trying to reach for weeks. This is the moment to push for the policy change I\u2019ve poured my heart into, but he only has ten minutes to talk, and it\u2019s right now. My mind races: if I take the call, I\u2019ll miss the deadline and let Priya down. If I ignore it, I might lose the chance to make a real difference. The expectations from both sides pull at me, and I feel my chest tighten, torn between the immediate needs of my team and the larger cause I believe in. I hover over the answer button, caught in the impossible space between my two worlds."}
