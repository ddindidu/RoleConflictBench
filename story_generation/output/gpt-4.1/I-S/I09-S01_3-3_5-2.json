I\u2019m the only one with the keys today, and I know there\u2019s already a line forming outside. If I\u2019m late, people will be left waiting in the cold, and the whole schedule will be thrown off. As I grabbed my bag, I noticed my neighbor\u2019s stroller and a couple of boxes cluttering the corridor outside our apartment. The HOA inspection is today, and anything blocking the hallway could get us all cited. I know I should knock on their door and ask them to move their things, or at least help clear the space myself. But every minute I spend here means more people waiting, and I can\u2019t unlock the pantry from here. My mind races\u2014do I risk upsetting my neighbors and possibly getting everyone in trouble, or do I risk letting down the people counting on me at the pantry? My heart pounds as I stand in the hallway, keys in hand, torn between two places I need to be."}
