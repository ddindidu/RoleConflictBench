The first is from Jamie, my closest friend, whose message is short but heavy: \u201cCan we talk? I\u2019m really hurt by what you said earlier.\u201d My stomach twists with guilt\u2014I hadn\u2019t realized my offhand comment would cut so deep. I know I need to call Jamie right now, to apologize, to explain, to be the friend who listens and makes things right. But then, my activist group\u2019s alert flashes across the screen: the state legislature is holding a surprise vote on the housing bill, and the outcome hinges on one undecided representative. We\u2019ve been working for months on this, and I\u2019m supposed to call the rep immediately, to make our case, to be the voice for dozens of families who need this law to pass. My heart pounds as I stare at my phone, torn between the friend who needs me and the cause that depends on me. Both expect me to show up, right now, and I can\u2019t see how to do both."}
