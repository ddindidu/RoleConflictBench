As an acquaintance, I always tried to keep things light and positive, steering clear of gossip. Suddenly, Mark, who I only knew casually, leaned in and made a snide remark about Lisa\u2019s recent project, saying she\u2019d really dropped the ball. I felt a twinge of discomfort\u2014Lisa wasn\u2019t there to defend herself, and I didn\u2019t want to be part of any negative talk.\n\nAt the same time, as a volunteer, I was trained to respect everyone\u2019s privacy, especially those we helped. The conversation shifted, and someone asked about a family we\u2019d assisted last week. It wasn\u2019t anything sensitive, but I knew how easily small talk could slip into sharing too much. I felt caught between not wanting to gossip or speak ill of Lisa, and not wanting to reveal anything about the people we served. My mind raced, trying to figure out how to respond without betraying either expectation, feeling the pressure of both roles pulling me in different directions."}
