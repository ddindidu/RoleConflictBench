It\u2019s late, and she\u2019s alone, scared, and needs me to come get her right away. I grab my keys, heart pounding, already halfway out the door. Then, another notification pops up: the activist group I\u2019m part of is about to send a crucial petition to our state senator, and this is the last chance to add my signature. We\u2019ve been working on this campaign for weeks, and my name on that list could make a difference. I freeze, torn. Jamie is counting on me to be there for her, to show up when she needs a friend most. But the group is counting on me too, to stand up for what we believe in and not let this moment slip by. My hands shake as I stare at my phone, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in, knowing I can\u2019t give both what they need from me right now."}
