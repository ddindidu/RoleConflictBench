It was Jamie, my closest friend, her voice trembling on the other end. \u201cCan you talk? I just had a huge fight with Alex. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d I could hear the tears in her voice, the kind that always made me drop everything and listen. As her friend, I knew she expected me to be there, to listen, to help her untangle her feelings. But as an advocate, I had a responsibility to my client, who was counting on me to be present and prepared for the court session that could change their life. The clock on my wall ticked louder, each second a reminder of the time slipping away. My heart twisted, torn between the urge to comfort Jamie and the duty to my client. I gripped the phone, feeling the weight of both roles pressing down, knowing that whatever I chose, I would be letting someone down."}
