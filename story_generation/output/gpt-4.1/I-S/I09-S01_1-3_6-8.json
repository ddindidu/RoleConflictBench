She\u2019s missed deliveries before, and I promised I\u2019d help her out this time. She\u2019s counting on me\u2014she even left a note on my door this morning, reminding me of the delivery window. But just as I\u2019m settling in, my phone buzzes with an urgent message from the volunteer coordinator. There\u2019s a new directive: all volunteers must report to the center immediately to review and implement new safety procedures. If we don\u2019t comply, the service could be suspended, leaving dozens of people without support. I know how important this is, and the coordinator\u2019s tone leaves no room for negotiation. My stomach twists as I stare at the clock, torn between my promise to Mrs. Lee and my responsibility as a volunteer. Both roles expect reliability, but right now, I can\u2019t be in two places at once."}
