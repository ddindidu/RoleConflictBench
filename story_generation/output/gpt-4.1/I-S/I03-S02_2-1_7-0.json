One is from my boyfriend, asking if we can talk tonight\u2014he says we need to sort things out, that we can\u2019t keep fighting about money. The other is from Maya, a fellow activist, her text urgent: \u201cWe need more people at the protest. Can you come now?\u201d I feel my chest tighten. I know how important it is to be there, to show up for the cause I care about, especially when so few are willing to stand in public. But I also know that if I don\u2019t try to fix things with him, the distance between us will only grow. He expects me to be present, to listen, to help us find a way through our arguments. My friends expect me to be reliable, to put the movement first. I pace the room, torn between the person I love and the cause I believe in, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
