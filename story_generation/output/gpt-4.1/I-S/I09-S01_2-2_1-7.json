Wanting to make a good impression, I baked a small cake, hoping to share it with the neighbors if I bumped into them. That afternoon, as I stepped into the hallway, I saw Mrs. Kim from next door. She smiled warmly, and I offered her a slice. As we chatted, I noticed she wasn\u2019t wearing a mask, and she reached out to shake my hand. \n\nJust yesterday, at my volunteer orientation, the coordinator had stressed the importance of following new safety protocols\u2014no handshakes, masks on at all times, and maintaining distance, even outside the volunteer site. We were told to model these behaviors everywhere, not just while volunteering, to set an example and keep everyone safe. \n\nStanding there, cake in hand, I felt torn. I wanted to be the friendly, approachable neighbor, but I also felt the weight of my responsibility as a volunteer to uphold the safety guidelines. My heart pounded as I hesitated, caught between the warmth of neighborly kindness and the strict expectations of my volunteer role."}
