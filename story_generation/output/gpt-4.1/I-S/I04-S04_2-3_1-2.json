It was Jamie, my closest friend, and her voice trembled on the other end. \u201cCan you talk? I really need you right now,\u201d she whispered, barely holding back tears. I glanced at the clock\u2014ten minutes until the polling station closed. I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss voting this year, not after everything that\u2019s happened. But Jamie never called like this unless it was serious. I could hear her sniffling, waiting for me to say something, to be there for her like I always tried to be. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the duty I felt as a citizen and the loyalty I owed my friend. I wanted to listen, to help her through whatever pain she was feeling, but the image of the locked polling station door flashed in my mind. I felt the weight of both expectations pressing down, my hand frozen on the doorknob, unable to move in either direction."}
