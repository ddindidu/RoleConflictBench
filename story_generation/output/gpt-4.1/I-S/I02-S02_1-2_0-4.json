I know that look\u2014she\u2019s had a rough day at work, and she needs me to listen, to be present, to hold her hand and let her vent. I set my bag down, ready to give her my full attention, when my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a number I recognize immediately: the legislative aide for Senator Kim. My heart jumps. We\u2019ve been trying to get this call for weeks, and now, finally, they have ten minutes to talk about the bill I\u2019ve poured my soul into. I glance at Maya, who\u2019s looking at me expectantly, and then at my phone, which keeps vibrating insistently.

My chest tightens as I stand frozen, torn between the person I love and the change I want to make."}
