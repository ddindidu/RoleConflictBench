My mentor\u2019s words echoed in my mind: \u201cTry to finish the code sample before our next meeting. It\u2019ll help you grow.\u201d I wanted to impress her, to show I was committed and capable. But as I reached for my coffee, my phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cCity survey on bus routes\u2014your input matters!\u201d I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d be a better citizen, to participate and help shape the community I live in. The survey was only open for a few more days, and public transport was something I cared about. Yet, every minute I spent on the survey was a minute away from debugging, from learning, from meeting my mentor\u2019s expectations. I felt torn, the weight of responsibility pressing from both sides. Should I focus on my growth as a mentee, or fulfill my duty as a citizen? My fingers hovered over the keyboard, heart pounding, as I wrestled with the choice."}
