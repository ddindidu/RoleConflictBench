The code just wouldn\u2019t run, and I knew I was stuck. As a mentee, I was supposed to reach out to my mentor as soon as I hit a wall, but my phone buzzed with a calendar alert: the court session was in thirty minutes. As an advocate, my presence was non-negotiable\u2014missing it could jeopardize the entire case. My mentor always emphasized transparency, expecting me to communicate any setbacks immediately, but the courthouse was across town, and I barely had time to get there. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to my mentor and the duty to my client. If I emailed my mentor now, I\u2019d be late for court; if I left without saying anything, I\u2019d be hiding my struggle. The weight of both roles pressed down on me, each demanding my full attention, each unwilling to wait. My heart pounded as I stood frozen, caught between two worlds, knowing I couldn\u2019t satisfy both."}
