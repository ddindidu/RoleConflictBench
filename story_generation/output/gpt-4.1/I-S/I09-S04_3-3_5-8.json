The HOA inspection was in an hour, and I knew anything left in the hallway could get us both cited. I\u2019d promised her I\u2019d keep the space clear, and I could already imagine her disappointment if I let her down. My phone buzzed\u2014an alert from the polling station. I\u2019d forgotten today was the last day to vote, and I had just ten minutes before the station closed. When I arrived, breathless, the official frowned at my ID. \u201cThere\u2019s a registration mismatch. You\u2019ll need to fill out a provisional ballot form before we close.\u201d I glanced at the clock, then at the corridor in my mind, cluttered with my neighbor\u2019s things. If I stayed to vote, I\u2019d risk the HOA citation for both of us. If I left, I\u2019d miss my chance to vote. My hands shook as I weighed the responsibility I owed my neighbor against my duty as a voter, feeling the pressure of both roles closing in on me."}
