The assignment wasn\u2019t urgent\u2014he\u2019d said the deadline was flexible, just a few weeks away\u2014but I wanted to impress him, to show I was committed and eager to learn. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d get a head start tonight.\n\nJust as I opened the first article, a notification popped up: \u201cLive Now: District Candidate Forum.\u201d I\u2019d been meaning to watch it. As a citizen, I believed in staying informed, participating in local elections, and giving feedback to those who represented me. The forum was only happening now, and I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to catch the full replay later.\n\nI felt a knot tighten in my stomach. If I focused on the reading, I\u2019d miss the chance to engage in my community. But if I watched the forum, I\u2019d be putting off the work my mentor expected of me. Both roles mattered to me, and both demanded my attention tonight. I stared at the screen, torn, the weight of conflicting expectations pressing down on me."}
