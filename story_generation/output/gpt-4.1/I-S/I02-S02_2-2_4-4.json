After weeks of mismatched schedules, my girlfriend and I finally carved out a single evening together before I left for a week-long conference. She\u2019d planned dinner, even picked out a movie she knew I\u2019d love. I could see the anticipation in her eyes as she set the table, her smile a quiet plea for my undivided attention. Just as I reached for her hand, my phone buzzed. It was a legislative aide\u2014one I\u2019d been trying to reach for months\u2014offering a ten-minute window to discuss the bill I\u2019d poured my heart into. My activist side screamed at me: this was the moment to push for real change, to make all those late nights and rallies count. But as I looked at her, I felt the weight of her hope, the silent expectation that, for once, I\u2019d choose us. My heart pounded, torn between the cause I believed in and the person I loved, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left behind."}
