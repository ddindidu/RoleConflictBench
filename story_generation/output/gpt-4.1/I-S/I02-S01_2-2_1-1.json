My volunteer shift started in twenty minutes, and the coordinator\u2019s message from this morning echoed in my mind: \u201cWe need everyone on time\u2014no exceptions.\u201d But as I reached for my keys, I heard a soft sniffle from the living room. My partner sat hunched on the couch, eyes red, clutching her phone. She\u2019d just gotten that email from her boss\u2014another project rejected. I knew how much this meant to her, how hard she\u2019d worked. She looked up at me, searching for comfort, and I felt the weight of her disappointment settle between us. I wanted to sit beside her, hold her hand, and listen. But the thought of letting down the team at the shelter gnawed at me. They were counting on me, too. My chest tightened as I stood in the hallway, torn between the person I love and the commitment I\u2019d made. I could feel both worlds pulling at me, each expecting me to be fully present, and I didn\u2019t know how to choose."}
