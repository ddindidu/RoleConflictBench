My mentor had squeezed in a session for me just before catching a long flight, and I knew how precious her time was. I wanted to make the most of every minute, to show her I respected her effort and commitment. But as we wrapped up, my friends texted, reminding me about our late-evening music plans. I\u2019d promised to bring my guitar and join them in the common room. The problem was, our building\u2019s quiet hours had just started, and I could see my neighbor\u2019s windows wide open across the courtyard. He\u2019d complained before about noise, and I knew the rules were there for a reason\u2014to respect everyone\u2019s right to peace and quiet. I felt torn, caught between honoring my mentor\u2019s time by not rushing off and fulfilling my promise to my friends, all while knowing I might disturb my neighbor and break the building\u2019s rules. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, guitar case in hand, unsure which responsibility I should honor."}
