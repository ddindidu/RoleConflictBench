I replayed the offhand comment I\u2019d made at lunch, realizing too late how it must have sounded. As a friend, I knew I needed to call Sam right away, to apologize and explain myself before the misunderstanding grew. But as I reached for my phone, I glanced at the clock\u2014polls were closing soon, and I still hadn\u2019t voted. I\u2019d grabbed the wrong wallet this morning, and my only valid ID was at home. I could still fetch it later, but the window was closing fast.\n\nMy heart pounded. Sam deserved my full attention, but so did my civic duty. If I called now, I might miss my chance to vote. If I rushed out the door, Sam might think I didn\u2019t care. Both roles demanded something immediate from me, and I felt torn in two, paralyzed by the weight of what I owed to my friend and to my responsibilities as a voter."}
