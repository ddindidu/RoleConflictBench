My part of the project was crucial\u2014if I didn\u2019t finish tonight, the whole team would be set back. I could already imagine the disappointment in my colleague\u2019s eyes, the frustration in tomorrow\u2019s meeting. But outside, the city was alive with voices. The demonstration had spilled onto my street, and I felt compelled to join. As a citizen, I believed in standing up for what\u2019s right, but the crowd was getting restless. Suddenly, someone beside me urged, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s show them we mean it!\u201d They pointed to the barricade blocking off city property. My heart pounded. Crossing it would be illegal, but the energy was contagious. I glanced at my phone\u2014messages from my team, reminders of my responsibility. I was torn, caught between the duty to my colleagues and the call to action as a citizen. The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I stood frozen, wrestling with what I owed to each part of myself."}
