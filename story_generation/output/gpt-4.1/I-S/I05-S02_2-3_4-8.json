They were counting on me to walk them through the final steps before our project deadline\u2014skills they needed, knowledge only I could share. I\u2019d spent hours preparing, determined not to let them down. Just as I was about to head into the meeting, my phone buzzed. It was the news network. They needed me live, now, to counter a wave of misinformation about our cause. My heart pounded. As an activist, I knew how crucial it was to seize this moment, to educate the public and defend the truth. But my mentees were waiting, relying on me to guide them. I felt torn, the weight of both responsibilities pressing in. I could almost hear the disappointment in their voices if I left, and the urgency in the anchor\u2019s tone if I didn\u2019t answer. My mind raced, caught between two worlds, each demanding all of me at the same time."}
