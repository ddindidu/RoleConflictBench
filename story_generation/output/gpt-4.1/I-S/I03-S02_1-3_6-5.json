Jake\u2019s last message blinked on the screen: \u201cI just wish you\u2019d told me sooner.\u201d Our weekend plans had gotten tangled up\u2014he thought we were going hiking, but I\u2019d mentioned a rally. Now he was upset, and I could feel the tension rising between us. I knew I should call him, talk it through, smooth things over before it grew into something bigger. That\u2019s what a good girlfriend would do\u2014resolve things, not let them fester.\n\nBut at the same time, my activist group\u2019s chat was exploding. The statehouse was holding a surprise vote on the bill we\u2019d been fighting for all year. The outcome was down to one undecided representative, and I was the only one with a personal connection. They needed me to call, to persuade, to make a difference\u2014right now, before the vote.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, my phone heavy in my hand. Jake needed me. The movement needed me. My chest tightened as I tried to decide which call to make first, knowing that whichever I chose, I\u2019d be letting someone down."}
