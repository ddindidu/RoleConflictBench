The code just wouldn\u2019t run, and I\u2019d already spent hours trying to fix it. As a mentee, I knew I was supposed to reach out to my mentor as soon as I hit a roadblock, but I kept hesitating. My mentor had a packed schedule, and I didn\u2019t want to seem incapable. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: I had a minor court hearing in an hour. As an advocate, my clients expected me to be fully prepared and present, no matter how small the case. I felt the pressure mounting\u2014if I emailed my mentor now, I might not have time to review my notes for the hearing. But if I waited, I\u2019d be letting my mentor down and delaying the project even further. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to communicate my struggles and the duty to represent my client. The weight of both roles pressed on me, and I sat frozen, unsure which expectation to meet first."}
