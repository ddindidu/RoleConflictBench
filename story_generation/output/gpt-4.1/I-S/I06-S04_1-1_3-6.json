As a mentee, I\u2019d promised my mentor to reach out whenever I hit a snag, no matter how small. Now, I had a minor question about a term in the project brief\u2014nothing urgent, but I knew she expected me to communicate openly. I typed out a quick message, hesitated, and glanced up. An election official called out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line on the left!\u201d My last name fit the bill, but the new line looked longer and less organized. The instructions were clear, though: follow the officials\u2019 directions. I felt a knot in my stomach. Should I send the message now, risking distraction and possibly missing the official\u2019s instructions? Or should I focus on the voting process, delaying my response and possibly disappointing my mentor? The pressure of both roles pressed in on me, each demanding my attention, each with its own set of expectations. I shifted my weight from foot to foot, caught between the two responsibilities, unsure which to prioritize."}
