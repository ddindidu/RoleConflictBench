My girlfriend and I had circled this evening on our calendars weeks ago, knowing it was the only time we\u2019d have together before I left for a week-long work trip. She wanted us to unplug, talk, and just be present with each other. I could see the anticipation in her eyes as we sat down at our favorite little caf\u00e9, her hand reaching for mine across the table.\n\nBut as we talked, the conversation drifted to my volunteer work at the shelter. She was genuinely curious, asking about the people I\u2019d met and the stories I\u2019d heard. I wanted to share, to let her into this part of my life, but I felt a knot in my stomach. Even though nothing sensitive had come up, I knew I was expected to protect the privacy of those I helped. She wanted closeness and honesty, but I was bound by trust and confidentiality. I could feel her disappointment as I hesitated, and the weight of both roles pressed down on me, leaving me torn between being the boyfriend she needed and the volunteer I promised to be."}
