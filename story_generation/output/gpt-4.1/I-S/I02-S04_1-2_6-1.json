Why didn\u2019t you tell me about your plans?\u201d My heart sinks. I\u2019d promised her we\u2019d talk through things better, especially after last month\u2019s argument. I want to call her right away, to clear up the misunderstanding before it grows into something bigger. But as I check the time, I realize the polling station closes in less than two hours. I\u2019d meant to vote earlier, but errands ran late, and now I\u2019m cutting it close. I know how much voting matters to me\u2014my voice, my responsibility. But Mia\u2019s voice is trembling in my head, her expectation that I\u2019ll be there for her, that I\u2019ll put us first. I feel torn, my chest tight with the pressure of choosing. If I rush to vote, I risk letting her down again. If I call her now, I might miss my chance to vote. Both roles demand something of me, and I can\u2019t see a way to meet them both. I stand frozen, phone in hand, keys in the other, caught between the two worlds I\u2019m supposed to belong to."}
