I glance at Mrs. Kim\u2019s door across the hall\u2014she\u2019s lived alone since her husband passed, and I know she gets anxious during bad weather. As her neighbor, I feel I should check in, maybe offer to bring her some candles or just reassure her she\u2019s not alone. But tonight is also the only live-streamed candidate forum before the election, and as a citizen, I promised myself I\u2019d watch, ask questions, and stay engaged. The forum is starting now, and I know how important it is to be informed, to participate, to help shape the future of our district. My phone buzzes with a reminder for the stream, but my eyes keep drifting to Mrs. Kim\u2019s door. I feel torn\u2014my sense of duty to my community pulling me in two directions, the weight of both roles pressing on my chest as the storm clouds gather outside."}
