My boyfriend was setting up the living room for our long-awaited movie night, the only evening we had together before I\u2019d be away for a week. He\u2019d been looking forward to this, dropping hints all week about popcorn and his favorite film. I wanted to be present, to laugh and relax with him, to show him he mattered. But my phone buzzed\u2014another reminder from the office. The partners had scheduled a last-minute meeting, the kind I was expected to attend without fail. As an advocate, punctuality and presence were non-negotiable, even for routine updates. I could already imagine the disappointment in his eyes if I left, but I also pictured the raised eyebrows and whispered judgments from my colleagues if I missed the meeting. My heart pounded as I stood between the living room and the hallway, torn by the demands of love and duty, wishing I could be in two places at once."}
