As his girlfriend, I wanted to be there for him, to listen and offer comfort. He started venting about work, and I sat beside him, nodding, trying to be present. But my mind kept drifting back to the files I\u2019d been sorting at the clinic earlier. Some of the stories I\u2019d read were heartbreaking, and the weight of those secrets pressed on me. Alex asked what was on my mind, sensing my distraction. I wanted to share, to let him in, but I knew I couldn\u2019t.
