Just then, Maya, my eager mentee from the internship program, slid into the seat beside me. She\u2019d been shadowing me for weeks, always full of questions about real-world cases and how to handle sensitive information. \u201cHow do you deal with tricky patient histories?\u201d she asked, glancing at the files in my hands.\n\nAs her mentor, I wanted to share my experience, to help her learn from real examples. But as a volunteer, I was bound by strict confidentiality. My mind raced\u2014should I give her a general answer, or would that be too vague to be useful? If I shared even a hint of a real case, I\u2019d be betraying the trust of the people we were helping. I could feel the tension knotting in my stomach, torn between being the open, supportive mentor Maya expected and the discreet, trustworthy volunteer the clinic needed."}
