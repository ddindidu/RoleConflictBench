She lost her brother this morning, and the world feels impossibly heavy. I want to hold her, to be the anchor she needs, to let her know she\u2019s not alone in this storm. My phone buzzes with a reminder: the polling station closes in ten minutes. I glance at the clock, my heart pounding. I promised myself I\u2019d vote\u2014civic duty, my voice, my responsibility. But how can I leave her now, when she\u2019s so raw and broken? She clings to my hand, her eyes pleading for comfort, and I feel torn in two. The weight of her grief presses against the ticking clock, and I\u2019m caught between being the boyfriend she needs and the citizen I want to be. My chest tightens as I wrestle with the impossible choice, the seconds slipping away."}
