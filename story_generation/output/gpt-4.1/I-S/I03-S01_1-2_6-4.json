He thought I\u2019d promised to spend Saturday with him, but I\u2019d only said I\u2019d try. Now he was upset, and I could feel the tension simmering between us. I wanted to call him, to clear things up, to reassure him that he mattered. But just as I was about to send a quick message, a woman approached the table, her hands trembling as she filled out the intake forms. She leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper, and confided something deeply personal about her living situation. I nodded, listening intently, knowing I had to keep her trust and respect her privacy. My phone buzzed again\u2014another message from him, probably wanting to talk things out right now. I felt torn, pulled between the need to resolve things with my boyfriend and the responsibility to be fully present and trustworthy for the woman in front of me. My heart pounded as I sat there, caught between two worlds, unsure which one needed me more in that moment."}
