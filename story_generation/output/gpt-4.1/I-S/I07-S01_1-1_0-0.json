In ten minutes, our weekly team meeting would start\u2014a routine catch-up, nothing urgent, and I knew it would be recorded for anyone who couldn\u2019t make it. Still, I could already imagine the disappointed look on my manager\u2019s face if I didn\u2019t show up, the subtle implication that I wasn\u2019t a team player. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift at the community center started in fifteen minutes. I\u2019d promised to be there on time, but I also knew that the first half hour was always slow, and there were plenty of other volunteers who could cover until I arrived. Yet, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I was letting someone down, no matter what I chose. The pressure from both sides pressed in on me\u2014my colleagues expecting my presence and participation, the volunteer coordinator counting on my reliability. I sat frozen at my desk, torn between two worlds, wishing I could be in both places at once."}
