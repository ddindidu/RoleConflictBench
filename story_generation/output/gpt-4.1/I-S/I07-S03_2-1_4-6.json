The quarterly report was due Monday, and I knew that if I didn\u2019t finish it today, my teammate would be stuck waiting, their own work stalled. I could almost hear the unspoken expectation in our last meeting: \u201cWe\u2019re counting on you.\u201d But as I glanced at my phone, a reminder popped up\u2014this weekend was the free vaccine clinic at the community center. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d volunteer, help out with the registration tables, do my part as a responsible citizen. The clinic only ran this weekend, and they were short on volunteers. I felt the weight of both roles pressing in. My colleagues needed me to meet the deadline, to keep the workflow smooth. My community needed me to step up, to help protect our neighbors\u2019 health. I could feel the tension building in my chest, torn between the demands of my job and my responsibility as a citizen, knowing that whatever I chose, something important would be left undone."}
