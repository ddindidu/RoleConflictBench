The message was urgent: a crucial vote on environmental policy was happening in less than an hour, and the outcome hinged on one undecided representative. As an activist, I was expected to call, to lobby, to do whatever it took to sway the vote. But the only leverage I had was a sensitive piece of information I\u2019d learned just yesterday\u2014something about the representative\u2019s personal life that could tip the scales if mentioned. As an acquaintance, I knew I shouldn\u2019t gossip or use what I\u2019d heard to harm someone\u2019s reputation. My activist friends expected results, but my conscience screamed at the thought of betraying a confidence. My hands trembled as I weighed the phone, caught between the demands of my cause and the ethics of personal trust, the seconds ticking away."}
