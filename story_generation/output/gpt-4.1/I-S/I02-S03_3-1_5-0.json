This was our last weekend together before she left for months, and I wanted every moment to count. She laughed, tossing her empty coffee cup in the air, and before I could react, it landed on the grass, just a few steps from a trash bin. She grinned, pulling me along, eager to keep moving and not waste a second. But my eyes lingered on the cup, the bold no-littering sign glaring at me from a nearby post. I felt a knot in my stomach\u2014she expected me to be present, to focus on us, not on trivial things. But as a citizen, I knew I should pick up the cup, respect the rules, and set an example. My heart pounded as I hesitated, torn between her expectant smile and the silent reproach of the park\u2019s clean paths."}
