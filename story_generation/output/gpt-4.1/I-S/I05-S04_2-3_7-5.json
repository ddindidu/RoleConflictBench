She was on the verge of a promotion that could change her life, and I knew how much my guidance meant to her. As her mentor, I was expected to be present, to encourage her, to help her grow into the confident professional she aspired to be. But as I glanced at the clock, my heart pounded. The polls would close in less than an hour, and tonight was my only chance to vote. I needed to bring my ID, which was at home, a twenty-minute drive away. The weight of my civic duty pressed on me\u2014I believed in participating, in making my voice heard. Yet, Maya\u2019s hopeful face reminded me of my responsibility to her. Torn between these two roles, I felt the pressure mounting, my mind racing through the consequences of letting either responsibility down. I tried to steady my breath, but the conflict gnawed at me, demanding a choice I wasn\u2019t ready to make."}
