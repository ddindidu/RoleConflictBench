My neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always reminded me to wait until the bin was full before dragging it out, so we wouldn\u2019t clutter the sidewalk. But tomorrow was trash pickup, and I\u2019d be gone all day, unable to bring it out later. I hesitated, feeling the weight of her expectation to be considerate with our shared space.\n\nLater, at the polling station, I joined the line to vote. An official announced, \u201cIf your last name is A\u2013M, please move to the new line.\u201d My last name fit, but the new line was barely moving, while the original one sped along. The official\u2019s voice was firm\u2014follow instructions, keep the process fair. I glanced at the others, some already shifting, some staying put.\n\nI felt torn, the same way I had with the trash bin. As a neighbor, I wanted to respect boundaries and not inconvenience others. As a voter, I was expected to follow directions, even if it meant waiting longer. The pressure from both sides pressed in, and I stood there, caught between what I owed to my neighbor and my duty as a citizen."}
