She\u2019s been looking forward to it, planning a cozy dinner and a movie at home, just the two of us. I promised her my undivided attention, no distractions, just us. But as I\u2019m getting ready, I remember today is election day. The polling station is open until 8 p.m., and I know how important it is to vote\u2014my parents always said it\u2019s a civic duty, and I believe that too. I could go earlier, but I want to make the most of every minute with Mia. If I leave during our evening, even for a short while, I\u2019ll break the promise of quality time. If I skip voting, I\u2019ll feel guilty for not doing my part. The clock ticks closer to dinner, and I feel the pressure mounting, torn between being the boyfriend Mia deserves and the responsible citizen I expect myself to be."}
