My boyfriend sat beside me, his eyes red and distant, barely speaking since the call about his uncle. I wanted to hold him, to be the steady presence he needed, but the clock on the wall kept ticking, reminding me that the polling station would close soon. He reached for my hand, and I squeezed it, feeling the weight of his grief. I knew he expected me to stay, to help him through the worst evening of his life. But I also knew how important it was to vote, how I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss it this year. My heart twisted as I tried to be present for him, but my mind kept drifting to the polling station, picturing the doors closing before I arrived. I felt torn in two, guilt pressing in from both sides, unsure which promise I was about to break."}
