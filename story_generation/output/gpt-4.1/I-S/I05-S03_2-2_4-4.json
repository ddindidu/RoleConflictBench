As a mentor, I had spent hours preparing a session for my team, determined to share the skills they needed before the big project deadline. My notes were organized, slides ready, and I could already picture the questions they might ask. But just as I was about to log in, my phone buzzed with a reminder\u2014the online candidate forum for my district was streaming live now. As a citizen, I felt a responsibility to stay informed, to listen, to vote wisely, and to give feedback that could shape our community. The forum was a rare chance to hear directly from those who wanted to represent us. My mind raced, torn between the commitment to my mentees, who relied on my guidance, and my duty as a citizen, which felt just as urgent. I stared at the two open tabs on my screen, heart pounding, feeling the weight of both roles pressing in, each demanding my full attention at the same moment."}
