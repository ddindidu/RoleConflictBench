The court session was in twenty minutes, and I still had to cross town. As an advocate, punctuality wasn\u2019t just a courtesy\u2014it was my duty to my client, whose future depended on my presence and preparation. But just as I was about to leave, an acquaintance from the office cornered me in the hallway, eyes wide with urgency. She whispered that she\u2019d heard something about a colleague\u2014something sensitive, something that could ruin his reputation if it spread. She pressed for details, assuming I knew more. As an acquaintance, I knew I should avoid gossip, keep confidences, and not speak ill of others. But she was insistent, and I could feel the pressure mounting. If I brushed her off too quickly, she might think I was hiding something, or worse, she might spread rumors herself. But every second I lingered, I risked being late for court, letting down my client and possibly jeopardizing their case. My mind raced, torn between the expectations of discretion and loyalty as an acquaintance, and the uncompromising punctuality demanded of me as an advocate."}
