Feels like forever since we had time, just us.\u201d He was right. With both our schedules packed, tonight was the only open evening before I left for a week-long work trip. I wanted to make it special, to show him he mattered. But then my calendar pinged\u2014a reminder for my volunteer shift at the shelter. I was supposed to be there at seven, sharp. The coordinator always emphasized punctuality, even though I knew a few others could cover the first hour if I was late. Still, I\u2019d promised to be reliable, and the animals counted on us. My chest tightened as I pictured my boyfriend waiting at the restaurant, checking his watch, while I rushed through traffic, torn between two promises. I wanted to be the dependable volunteer and the loving girlfriend, but tonight, I couldn\u2019t be both."}
