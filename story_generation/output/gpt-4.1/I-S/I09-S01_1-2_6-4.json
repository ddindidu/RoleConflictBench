My neighbor, Mrs. Kim, had mentioned she was expecting a package too, and she always seemed to miss them. She\u2019d asked if I could keep an eye out, and I\u2019d agreed, knowing how much she relied on these little favors. Just as I was about to settle in, my phone buzzed\u2014a reminder for my volunteer shift at the community center. I hurried over, promising myself I\u2019d be back in time for the deliveries.\n\nAt the check-in table, a client leaned in, voice barely above a whisper, and confided a personal worry. I listened, feeling the weight of her trust and the responsibility to keep her words private. But as I glanced at the clock, anxiety gnawed at me. If I stayed to support her, I might miss the delivery window for Mrs. Kim. If I left, I\u2019d be abandoning someone who needed a safe space. The expectations from both sides pressed in, and I felt torn, caught between being a good neighbor and a trustworthy volunteer, unsure which role to honor in that moment."}
