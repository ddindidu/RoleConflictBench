I\u2019m free all week!\u201d I smile, picturing her excitement, and start typing a reply. Before I hit send, another notification pops up\u2014my activist group\u2019s chat. \u201cUrgent: We have one hour to add signatures to the petition before it goes to the senator. Every name counts!\u201d My heart pounds. I know how much this policy change means, how hard we\u2019ve worked, and how my voice could make a difference. But Mia\u2019s been looking forward to this week, hoping we\u2019d finally have time just for us, no distractions. I feel the weight of both worlds pressing in\u2014her hope for connection, my responsibility to the cause. My fingers hover over the screen, torn between the promise I made to her and the commitment I feel to the movement. I can\u2019t ignore either, but I can\u2019t do both at once. My chest tightens as I try to decide which part of me to honor in this moment."}
