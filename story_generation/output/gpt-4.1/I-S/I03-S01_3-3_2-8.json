He needed me\u2014he said he didn\u2019t want to be alone, that he just needed someone to sit with him, to listen, to hold his hand. My heart ached for him, and I promised I\u2019d be there soon. As I hung up, my phone buzzed again. It was a message from the volunteer coordinator: \u201cAll volunteers must report in person tonight. We have to implement new safety procedures immediately or risk shutting down the shelter. No exceptions.\u201d I stared at the screen, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing down on me. My boyfriend needed me more than ever, but so did the people at the shelter\u2014and if I didn\u2019t show up, I\u2019d be letting down the team and the people who depended on us. My chest tightened as I tried to figure out how I could possibly be in two places at once, torn between love and responsibility, knowing that whatever I chose, someone would be left needing me."}
