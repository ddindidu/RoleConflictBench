The truth is, my teammates and I are barely speaking after a heated argument over our deliverable. I know I\u2019m supposed to be honest and reach out for help, but I hesitate, not wanting to seem incapable. Just as I start typing a reply, another notification pops up\u2014an urgent alert from my activist group. The state legislature is holding a surprise vote on the bill we\u2019ve been fighting for, and the outcome hinges on one undecided representative. They need me to call now, to share my story and sway the vote. My hands tremble as I weigh my options. My mentor expects transparency and responsibility, but my activist community is counting on my voice in this critical moment. I feel torn, the pressure mounting from both sides, knowing that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
