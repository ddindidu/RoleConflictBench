The deadline wasn\u2019t for another week, and honestly, my team could keep moving without it for a few days. Still, I knew my manager expected me to stay on top of things and not let tasks pile up. My phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator: an urgent directive. Apparently, if we didn\u2019t follow the new procedures immediately, the community service we provided could be shut down. The coordinator\u2019s message was clear\u2014everyone needed to drop what they were doing and help implement the changes right away.\n\nI felt the pressure mounting. My colleagues trusted me to be reliable, to keep my promises and meet deadlines. But the volunteer work mattered, too\u2014people depended on us, and the consequences of inaction were serious. I could feel my chest tighten as I weighed the expectations on both sides, torn between my responsibility to my team and the urgent call to serve the community. I glanced between my work laptop and my phone, heart pounding, unsure which role I should answer first."}
