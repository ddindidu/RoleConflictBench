It\u2019s Jamie, my closest friend, texting, \u201cUgh, today\u2019s dragging. Wish I could just talk to someone.\u201d I know Jamie\u2019s been having a rough time lately, and I promised I\u2019d always be there to listen. I glance at the clock\u2014if I don\u2019t swing by my apartment now to grab my ID, I won\u2019t be able to vote tomorrow. The polls are open, but today is my only window to get the ID I forgot. My chest tightens. Jamie expects me to reply, maybe even call, and I want to be the friend who listens, who\u2019s there when it matters. But I also feel the weight of my responsibility as a voter, the importance of showing up and making my voice heard. I stare at my phone, thumb hovering over the screen, torn between the urge to support my friend and the need to fulfill my civic duty. The minutes tick by, and I can feel the pressure mounting from both sides, each expectation pulling me in a different direction."}
