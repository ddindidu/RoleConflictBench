The team meeting was about to start, and this was the final discussion before we locked in decisions that would shape our project for months. My manager had emphasized how important it was for everyone to be present and engaged. I knew my input mattered, and my absence would be noticed.\n\nBut my phone buzzed with a reminder: my volunteer shift started in fifteen minutes. I was the only one scheduled to unlock the facility and begin the service. People would already be waiting outside, some of them relying on us for their only hot meal of the day. If I was late, the doors would stay closed, and the line would grow longer and more anxious.\n\nI felt pulled in two directions, the weight of responsibility pressing on my chest. My colleagues expected me to be a committed team player, but the people at the facility depended on me, too. I could already imagine the disappointment on both sides if I let them down. My mind raced, torn between the meeting and the waiting crowd, unsure which obligation I could bear to break."}
