She\u2019d just lost her uncle, and the grief in the apartment felt heavy and raw. She looked at me, eyes red, and whispered, \u201cCan we just play some music tonight? Loud, like he used to. I need to feel him here.\u201d I nodded, wanting nothing more than to help her through this pain, to be the boyfriend she needed\u2014someone who would do anything to comfort her.\n\nBut as I reached for the speaker, I remembered the building\u2019s quiet hours had started. Our neighbor, Mrs. Lee, always left her windows open, and she\u2019d complained before about noise. The rules were clear: no loud music after ten. I could already imagine her frustration, maybe even a call to the landlord. I felt torn, my heart pulled in two directions\u2014between being the partner who would do anything to ease her sorrow, and the citizen who respected the peace and rights of others. My hand hovered over the play button, my mind racing, caught between love and responsibility, not knowing which role I should let down."}
