The subject line read, \u201cFYI\u2014No Action Needed.\u201d I knew the unspoken rule: even if it wasn\u2019t urgent, I should acknowledge receipt within a few hours. It was a small thing, but it mattered for team trust and communication. At the same time, my phone buzzed with a reminder about the client meeting in ten minutes. Their case was complicated, with high stakes and a hearing scheduled for tomorrow. I needed every minute to review the files and prepare my arguments\u2014my client was counting on me to be thorough and sharp, to catch every detail that could make or break their case.\n\nI stared at the screen, feeling the pressure build. If I paused to reply to my colleague, I\u2019d lose precious focus and time for my client. But if I ignored the message, I risked seeming unresponsive, maybe even disrespectful, to my team. My mind raced, torn between the immediate needs of my client and the ongoing expectations of my colleagues, both roles demanding my attention in different ways."}
