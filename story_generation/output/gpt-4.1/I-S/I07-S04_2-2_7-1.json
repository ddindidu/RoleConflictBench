We\u2019re stuck on a project detail, and everyone\u2019s waiting for my clarification before they can move forward. I glance at the clock\u2014there\u2019s barely two hours left before the polling station closes. I promised myself I\u2019d vote today, but the afternoon slipped away with errands and now time is tight. My colleagues expect a quick response; the project can\u2019t progress without it. But if I stop to answer emails and messages, I might miss my chance to vote. I feel the pressure mounting\u2014on one side, my responsibility to my team, who are counting on me to keep things moving; on the other, my civic duty, the importance of making my voice heard. My heart pounds as I weigh the expectations, torn between letting down my coworkers and letting myself down as a citizen. I stare at my phone, paralyzed, knowing I can\u2019t do both at once."}
