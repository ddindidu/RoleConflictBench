It was Mark, an old acquaintance from college. He sounded desperate\u2014his moving help had bailed, and he needed someone to help carry boxes to his new apartment. I could hear the stress in his voice, and I knew he didn\u2019t have many people to call. As an acquaintance, I felt I should step up, offer my help, and not let him down. But today is also election day, and I\u2019d planned to vote before work. I\u2019d set aside my passport as ID, but now, with Mark\u2019s request, I\u2019d have to rush, and I might forget my ID or bring the wrong one. I could always fetch another ID later, but the polling station is out of the way, and I worry about lines growing longer as the day goes on. I feel torn\u2014Mark is counting on me, but so is my civic duty. The pressure of being a reliable acquaintance clashes with my responsibility as a voter, and I can\u2019t shake the anxiety of letting someone\u2014or something\u2014down."}
