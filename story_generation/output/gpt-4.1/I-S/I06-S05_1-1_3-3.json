The terminology was unfamiliar, but it wasn\u2019t stopping my progress. As a mentee, I knew my mentor expected me to reach out with any questions, no matter how small. She always said, \u201cDon\u2019t let confusion fester.\u201d But as an advocate, I was due in court in less than an hour for a minor hearing. My client\u2019s case wasn\u2019t high-stakes, but I still owed them my full attention and preparation. I could email my mentor now, but that would mean splitting my focus, possibly missing something important for my client. If I waited, I\u2019d be ignoring my mentor\u2019s advice and risking her disappointment. The pressure built in my chest\u2014torn between being the diligent mentee she wanted and the dedicated advocate my client deserved. My phone buzzed with a reminder: \u201cHearing in 30 minutes.\u201d I stared at the screen, heart pounding, caught between two roles, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
