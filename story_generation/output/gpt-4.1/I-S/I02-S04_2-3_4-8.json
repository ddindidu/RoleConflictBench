My girlfriend and I have been looking forward to tonight all week\u2014our only free evening before I leave for a work trip. She\u2019s already at the restaurant, texting me updates about the table, the menu, the candle she picked out. I promised I\u2019d be there on time, that nothing would get in the way. But here I am, standing in a crowded polling station, clutching my ID as an official explains that my registration doesn\u2019t match. If I want my vote to count, I have to fill out a provisional ballot, and the station closes in ten minutes. The form is long, the line is slow, and my heart pounds with guilt. I know how much tonight means to her, but I also know how important it is to vote, to do it right, to follow every instruction. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the weight of both promises presses down on me as I stare at the form, torn between the person I love and the duty I believe in."}
