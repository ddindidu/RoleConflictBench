She\u2019s been looking forward to this\u2014dinner at her favorite place, just us, no distractions. I promised her my full attention, no work calls, no checking emails. But as I\u2019m getting ready, my phone buzzes. It\u2019s a message from my firm: the opposing counsel in tomorrow\u2019s high-stakes case wants to meet tonight to discuss a possible settlement. My presence is crucial; missing it could jeopardize months of work and the client\u2019s future. I stare at my reflection, heart pounding, torn between the warmth in Mia\u2019s eyes when I walk through her door and the weight of my client\u2019s trust. Both need me, both expect me to show up. I can\u2019t be in two places at once, and the pressure is suffocating. I grip my phone, caught in the impossible space between love and duty, knowing that whatever I choose, something important will be left behind."}
