It was Mia, my closest friend, texting: \u201cUgh, today\u2019s been endless. Can you talk?\u201d I could almost hear the exhaustion in her words. I knew she needed me to listen, to be there for her like I always tried to be. But just then, the volunteer coordinator gathered us, reminding everyone about the new safety steps. \u201cNo exceptions,\u201d she said, her eyes scanning the group. I was assigned to the front desk, where I had to greet visitors and make sure every single protocol was followed. My phone wasn\u2019t supposed to be out, and I was expected to give my full attention to the job. I stared at Mia\u2019s message, feeling the weight of her need for support, while also hearing the coordinator\u2019s voice in my head. My heart pounded as I wrestled with what to do\u2014be the friend Mia needed right now, or the reliable volunteer everyone was counting on."}
