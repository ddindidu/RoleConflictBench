She was torn between two job offers and wanted my advice. As her mentor, I knew she expected me to provide thoughtful guidance, even though I usually just offered casual tips on minor choices. This felt bigger, and I could see how much she needed my support. At the same time, I glanced at the clock and remembered today was voting day. I\u2019d planned to go before work, but in my rush, I\u2019d left my main ID at home. I had a backup in my bag, but I wasn\u2019t sure if it would be accepted. If not, I\u2019d have to go home later to fetch the right one, which would mean missing the window when Sarah was free. The pressure built inside me\u2014Sarah\u2019s anxious eyes on me, the civic duty tugging at my conscience. I felt torn, knowing I couldn\u2019t fully meet both expectations at once. My mind raced, weighing the importance of being present for Sarah against the responsibility of casting my vote."}
