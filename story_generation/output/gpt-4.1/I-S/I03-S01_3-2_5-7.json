It was the last weekend before Alex left for his job abroad. We\u2019d promised to spend every moment together, making memories to last until he returned. He was still asleep, his arm draped over me, and I felt a pang of guilt. The volunteer coordinator had been clear\u2014everyone needed to be there, especially with the new safety protocols. They were counting on me to set an example. But Alex\u2019s hopeful smile last night replayed in my mind, his words echoing: \u201cLet\u2019s make this weekend just about us.\u201d I stared at the ceiling, torn. If I left for my shift, I\u2019d miss breakfast, maybe even our planned walk. If I stayed, I\u2019d let down my team and risk the safety standards we\u2019d just set. My heart thudded with anxiety, caught between the warmth of Alex\u2019s embrace and the weight of my commitment to the volunteer group."}
