She was on the verge of accepting a job offer that could define her career, and she looked to me for guidance. As her mentor, I felt the weight of responsibility to provide her with structured, thoughtful advice, to help her see the long-term implications and make the best possible choice. But as her advocate, I was also expected to give her clear, accurate legal advice, even in these informal moments. The problem was, the legal aspects of her contract were murky, and I knew that a casual explanation might gloss over crucial details. Yet, if I delved too deeply, I risked overwhelming her or crossing the line into formal legal counsel, which our firm discouraged outside official consultations. My mind raced, torn between the urge to protect her future and the boundaries of my professional role. I could feel the tension tightening in my chest as I weighed my words, knowing that whatever I said next could tip the balance of her decision\u2014and my own integrity."}
