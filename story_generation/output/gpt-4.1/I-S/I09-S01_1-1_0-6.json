She smiled, and I returned the gesture, exchanging a quick hello as we always do. I know she appreciates these small courtesies; it\u2019s part of being a good neighbor, keeping things warm and friendly. But as I walked away, my phone buzzed with an email from the volunteer coordinator. She suggested that, if I had time today, I should reorganize the supply closet at the community center according to her new system. I glanced at my watch\u2014if I stopped to chat with Mrs. Lee, as she seemed to want, I\u2019d be late to the center and might not have enough time to finish the task. I felt a knot in my stomach. I wanted to be the neighbor who listens and the volunteer who follows through, but right now, I couldn\u2019t see how to be both. I stood in the hallway, torn, the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
