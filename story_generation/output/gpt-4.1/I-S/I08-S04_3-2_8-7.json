The signature had smudged, and she explained that if I didn\u2019t fix it, my vote might not count. As I reached for the pen, I noticed the poll worker was someone I knew\u2014an acquaintance from my neighborhood. Just last week, I\u2019d overheard a rumor about her, something that could easily damage her reputation if it spread. I\u2019d promised myself never to gossip or speak ill of others, no matter what I heard.\n\nNow, as I prepared to follow her instructions, I felt a strange tension. If I did as she asked, would others think I was giving her special treatment because of what I knew? If I hesitated or questioned her, would I be casting doubt on her integrity, feeding into the very gossip I wanted to avoid? My hands trembled slightly as I weighed the expectations: to be a fair, rule-abiding voter, and a trustworthy, discreet acquaintance. The pressure of these conflicting roles pressed in on me, and I found myself frozen, pen hovering over the envelope, unsure of what to do next."}
