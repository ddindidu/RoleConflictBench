She barely looked at me as she got ready for work, her silence heavier than any words. We\u2019d reached a breaking point\u2014she said she wasn\u2019t sure if we should even be together anymore. I knew I had to talk to her, to try and fix things before the distance between us became permanent. But as I reached for my phone to text her, I remembered: today was my only chance to swing by my parents\u2019 house and grab my passport, the only valid ID I had left. Without it, I couldn\u2019t vote tomorrow, and I\u2019d promised myself I wouldn\u2019t miss this election. The clock was ticking. If I went to see Mia at lunch, I\u2019d miss my window to get the ID. If I went for the ID, I\u2019d be putting my relationship on hold at the worst possible moment. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations\u2014be the boyfriend who fights for us, or the citizen who shows up. I stood in the hallway, keys in hand, paralyzed by the choice."}
