The police had just started blocking the exits, and panic was beginning to ripple through the group. As one of the organizers, I knew I had to act fast\u2014coordinate a safe response, keep everyone calm, and make sure no one got hurt. But then, another vibration: a message from my manager, marked urgent. Leadership needed a prompt reply to confirm details for an external partner, and I was the point of contact. I could almost hear my colleagues\u2019 voices in my head, reminding me of the importance of timely communication, especially with high-stakes projects. My hands shook as I toggled between the group chat for the protest and my work email, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in. I knew that whichever message I answered first, I\u2019d be letting someone down. My heart pounded as I tried to decide where my attention belonged in this moment."}
