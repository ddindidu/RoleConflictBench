Still, I\u2019d promised my colleagues I\u2019d finish it today, and I hated letting people down. But I\u2019d also promised myself I\u2019d vote. I rushed to the polling station, only to be told there was a registration issue. The official explained I\u2019d need to fill out a provisional ballot form, and the station closed in ten minutes. My mind raced: if I stayed, I\u2019d be late finishing my work, and my team might worry or have to cover for me. If I left, I\u2019d miss my chance to vote, something I believed was my civic duty. The official handed me the form, her eyes expectant. My phone buzzed with a message from my colleague, asking if I\u2019d uploaded my files yet. I stood there, torn, feeling the weight of both promises pressing in on me, unsure which role I owed more in this moment."}
