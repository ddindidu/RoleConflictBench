It was Sam, my friend who\u2019d just moved into a new apartment. \u201cHey, can you hop on a quick video call? I\u2019m stuck with this bookshelf and the instructions make no sense.\u201d I could hear the frustration in his voice, and I knew he\u2019d been having a rough week. As a friend, I felt I should drop everything and help him out, even if just for a few minutes.\n\nBut at that moment, I was caught in the middle of a street demonstration. The crowd was growing restless, and someone nearby nudged me, whispering, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s step past the barricade. We need to show them we mean business.\u201d I glanced at the police tape and the officers watching us closely. As a citizen, I knew I was expected to respect the law and public property, not to mention the safety of everyone around.\n\nMy phone vibrated again\u2014Sam was calling. I stood there, torn between answering my friend\u2019s call for help and the pressure from the crowd to cross the line, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
