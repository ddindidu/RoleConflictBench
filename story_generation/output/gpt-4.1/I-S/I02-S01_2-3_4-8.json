My girlfriend and I had circled this evening on our calendars weeks ago, knowing it was the only time we\u2019d have together before I left for a week-long work trip. She\u2019d planned a quiet dinner at her place, just the two of us, no distractions. I could see how much she was looking forward to it\u2014her texts all day were full of excitement and little hearts. But just as I was about to leave work, my phone buzzed with a message from the volunteer coordinator. There was an urgent situation at the shelter, and new procedures had to be implemented immediately. The coordinator\u2019s message was clear: everyone needed to come in tonight, or the service might be shut down. I felt my chest tighten. I knew how much the shelter depended on us, and I didn\u2019t want to let the team down. But I also couldn\u2019t bear the thought of disappointing her, not after how much this night meant to both of us. I sat in my car, keys in hand, torn between two promises, feeling the weight of both worlds pressing in on me."}
