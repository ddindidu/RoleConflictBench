As a mentor, I was guiding Priya through her first major compliance review, a task so critical that a single oversight could cost the company dearly. She looked at me, her eyes searching for reassurance as she struggled with the final report. I knew she needed me\u2014my experience, my calm, my step-by-step guidance. But my phone buzzed again: a reminder for the court session across town, where I was expected as the lead advocate. The case was at a turning point, and my absence could tip the scales. Both roles demanded my full presence, both situations were unforgiving of mistakes or delays. My mind raced, torn between the responsibility to nurture Priya\u2019s growth and the duty to stand up for my client in court. I felt the weight of expectation pressing from both sides, my heart pounding as I tried to decide where I was needed most."}
