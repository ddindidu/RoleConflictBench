The HOA inspection is tomorrow, and I know anything blocking the exit could get us both cited. As her neighbor, I want to be considerate and not overstep, but I also don\u2019t want our building to get in trouble. At the same time, my phone keeps buzzing\u2014my client\u2019s case has taken a complicated turn, and she\u2019s waiting for my call. As her advocate, I owe her my full attention and clear, thorough advice. I feel the pressure mounting: should I knock on Mrs. Patel\u2019s door and risk upsetting her, or focus on my client, who\u2019s depending on me for guidance? My mind races with the expectations from both sides, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that whatever I choose, I\u2019ll be letting someone down."}
