It was Jamie, my closest friend. Her voice trembled, \u201cCan you talk? I just had a huge fight with Alex. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d I could hear the tears in her voice, and I knew she needed me to listen, to be there for her like I always promised. But I glanced at the clock\u2014fifteen minutes until my shift started, and the coordinator had sent a group message this morning: \u201cPlease, everyone, be on time. We\u2019re short-staffed and need all hands from the start.\u201d I felt my stomach twist. If I stayed to talk, I\u2019d be late and let the team down. If I left now, I\u2019d be abandoning Jamie when she needed me most. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, phone pressed to my ear, torn between being the friend Jamie needed and the volunteer my team depended on."}
