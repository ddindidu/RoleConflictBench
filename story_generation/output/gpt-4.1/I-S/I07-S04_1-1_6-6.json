As a colleague, I always try to respond to emails and messages quickly, even if it\u2019s just to acknowledge them. I glanced at my phone\u2014an informational message from a teammate, nothing urgent, but I knew she appreciated prompt replies. At the same time, an election official called out, \u201cIf your last name starts with A through M, please move to the new line on the left.\u201d My last name fit the criteria, but the new line looked longer and slower. The instructions were clear, though, and I wanted to do my civic duty properly.\n\nI felt a tug between my roles. Should I quickly reply to my colleague, risking being seen as distracted or disrespectful in the polling place? Or should I focus on following the official\u2019s directions, even though it meant a longer wait and possibly delaying my response? The pressure of being a reliable coworker clashed with my desire to be a conscientious voter. I hesitated, caught between the expectations of my workplace and my responsibilities as a citizen, unsure which role to prioritize in that moment."}
