He\u2019d just moved in and looked eager for a friendly suggestion. I started to tell him about my favorite spot when suddenly, the building alarms blared and my phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning. I glanced out the window and saw water creeping up the street, people hurrying to higher ground. Mark, oblivious to the danger, pressed for details about the menu and atmosphere, clearly hoping for a real conversation. As a neighbor, I wanted to be helpful, to make him feel welcome. But as a citizen, I knew I should be alert, maybe help others evacuate, or at least get myself to safety. My mind raced\u2014should I stay and offer the comfort of a friendly chat, or cut him off and focus on the emergency? The weight of both expectations pressed on me, and I felt torn, caught between the urge to support someone new and the responsibility to act for the greater good."}
