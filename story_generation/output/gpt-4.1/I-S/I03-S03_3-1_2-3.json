He hadn\u2019t spoken much since the call about his uncle. I wanted to be present, to listen, to hold him through the waves of grief. My phone buzzed with a reminder: the city\u2019s bus route survey, closing in a few hours. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d participate, knowing how much public transit matters to our community. I could hear my own voice in my head, urging me to be a responsible citizen, to give feedback that could help so many people. But Alex needed me now, needed my full attention, my comfort. I felt torn, guilt prickling at the edges of my thoughts. If I turned away, even for a few minutes, would he feel abandoned? If I ignored the survey, would I be letting down my neighbors? The weight of both roles pressed on me, each demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give at the same time."}
