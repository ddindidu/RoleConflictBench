My team was gathering in the conference room, ready to discuss project updates that would shape our next quarter\u2014updates I\u2019d miss entirely if I wasn\u2019t there. I knew my colleagues counted on me to contribute, to ask the right questions, to show I was invested. But the news network\u2019s message was clear: misinformation about our cause was spreading fast, and they needed someone now\u2014me\u2014to set the record straight on live TV. My activist friends always said I was the best at explaining our mission, and I felt the weight of their trust. I could almost hear my manager\u2019s voice, reminding me how important this meeting was, while at the same time, I pictured the community relying on me to speak up. My heart pounded as I stood in the hallway, torn between the conference room door and the phone in my hand, knowing I couldn\u2019t be in both places at once."}
