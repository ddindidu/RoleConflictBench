She had squeezed me in just before her flight, her voice brisk but kind as she reminded me she only had an hour. I knew how precious her time was, and I wanted to make the most of every minute, to show her I respected her schedule and valued her guidance. But my phone kept buzzing\u2014messages from my client\u2019s family, desperate for reassurance. The trial was tomorrow, and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. I was their advocate, the one they trusted to fight for their future, and I hadn\u2019t finished preparing my arguments. My mind raced between the questions I needed to ask my mentor and the notes I still had to review for court. I felt torn, the weight of two worlds pressing down on me. Should I focus on learning from my mentor, honoring her time, or should I cut the session short to give my client the attention they deserved? My heart pounded as I stared at the clock, caught between the expectations of being a good mentee and a responsible advocate, unsure which role to let down."}
