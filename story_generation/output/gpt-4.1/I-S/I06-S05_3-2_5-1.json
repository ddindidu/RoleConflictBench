As a mentee, I knew I was supposed to reach out to my mentor the moment I hit a roadblock, and right now, the conflict with my teammates was more than a roadblock\u2014it was a full-blown barricade. Our project was slipping off schedule, and I could feel the pressure mounting. But just as I started drafting an email to my mentor, my phone buzzed. It was a client, needing urgent legal advice. Their case had taken a complicated turn, and as their advocate, I was expected to provide clear, thorough guidance\u2014no room for error or delay.\n\nI felt torn. If I focused on my client, I\u2019d be neglecting my responsibility to keep my mentor informed, risking my own progress and trust. But if I prioritized my mentor, my client might make a misstep without my counsel. My chest tightened as I weighed the expectations pressing in from both sides, each demanding my immediate attention, each too important to ignore."}
