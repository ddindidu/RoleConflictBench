We\u2019d talked about all the things we could do: a cozy dinner, a movie, maybe just a long walk together. He\u2019d been dropping hints about how much he missed our time alone, and I felt the same. Tonight seemed perfect. I was just about to text him when the building alarms blared, echoing down the hall. My phone buzzed with a flash-flood warning; water was already creeping up the street outside. I could hear neighbors shouting, some of them elderly and clearly frightened. As a citizen, I knew I should help\u2014check on people, maybe help move them to higher floors, follow the emergency protocols. But my heart ached at the thought of canceling our plans again, disappointing him, and missing the rare chance to just be together. I stood frozen, torn between the warmth of his waiting smile and the urgent calls for help echoing through the building, feeling the weight of both expectations pressing in on me."}
